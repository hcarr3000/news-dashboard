**INVESTMENT MEMO**
**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** GEM-PM
**Date:** August 01, 2025
**Subject:** Investment Thesis for Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX)

**1. Executive Summary & Investment Thesis:**

*   **Recommendation:** Tactical Long / Monitor
*   **Price Target & Time Horizon:** No specific price target can be derived given the limited quantitative data (absence of revenue, cost structures, and full balance sheet). However, based on the current P/E of 15.17 and a calculated LTM EPS of $4.16 (Q2'24 - Q1'25), the implied price is approximately $63.10. Our recommendation implies potential for upside towards the mid-to-high end of its 52-week range ($44.5 - $78.85) if recent positive earnings momentum sustains. Time horizon: 12-18 months.
*   **Thesis Summary (The Variant Perception):**
    *   SKX exhibits a pattern of significant earnings beats in certain quarters (e.g., Q1-Q3 2023, Q1 2024, Q1 2025), which may not be fully appreciated by a market potentially over-indexing on recent misses (Q4 2024, Q2 2024).
    *   While recent earnings surprises have shown volatility, the overall trend of reported EPS has been generally upward over the past few years, reflecting underlying operational improvements or effective cost management not always captured in consensus estimates.
    *   The current P/E of 15.17 appears reasonable, if not slightly undervalued, for a company demonstrating periods of strong EPS growth and significant surprise magnitudes, suggesting the market may be pricing in undue skepticism or underestimating future earnings power.
*   **Key Catalysts:**
    *   Consistent re-establishment of positive EPS surprise trend, particularly the upcoming Q2 2025 earnings report surpassing the $0.833 estimate.
    *   Sustained top-line growth (not observable in provided data, but implied by EPS growth) driving improved operating leverage.
    *   Positive sentiment shift as the market recognizes the historical ability to deliver robust earnings.
*   **Conviction Level:** Medium. While the quantitative earnings data shows a compelling history of outperformance against estimates (with notable exceptions), the absence of critical qualitative data (market position, strategic initiatives, competitive dynamics, economic headwinds/tailwinds) prevents a high-conviction call. Further analysis is required.

**2. Business & Competitive Landscape:**

*   **Business Model:** Based solely on the provided historical earnings data for Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX), we can infer SKX operates a business subject to quarterly reporting cycles and analyst estimates, typical of a publicly traded consumer discretionary company, likely in footwear/apparel. The seasonality of EPS (e.g., lower Q4, higher Q1/Q3) suggests a consumer-facing business with predictable demand patterns tied to holiday or back-to-school seasons.
*   **Industry Deep Dive:** No qualitative news was provided, thus a deep dive into the industry or its current state cannot be performed based on the supplied data.
*   **Competitive Moat:** Without insights into brand strength, distribution channels, R&D, or customer loyalty (which would typically be found in qualitative news or financial statements), assessing a competitive moat is not possible. The fluctuating nature of EPS surprises could imply a highly competitive environment where forecasting is difficult, or simply a management team that manages expectations.

**3. Synthesis of Recent Information & Scuttlebutt:**

*   **News Flow Analysis:** No qualitative news summaries or "scuttlebutt" were provided for analysis. Therefore, this memo's insights are derived purely from the quantitative earnings surprise history and basic financial metrics. The analysis will focus on patterns and trends within the reported EPS and surprise percentages.

**4. The Bull Case (Primary Drivers):**

*   **Historical EPS Outperformance:** SKX has a demonstrated ability to significantly beat analyst EPS estimates in many quarters, particularly in 2023 (Q1-Q3 surprises ranging from +67% to +81%) and Q1 2024 (+20.9%) and Q1 2025 (+14.1%). This indicates potential for underestimated operational efficiency or demand.
*   **Earnings Rebound in Q1 2025:** The strong +14.11% surprise in Q1 2025, following a miss in Q4 2024, suggests resilience and the potential for a renewed positive trend after a period of mixed results.
*   **Attractive Valuation:** A P/E of 15.17 (based on LTM EPS of $4.16) appears reasonable given the company's historical ability to generate positive EPS and occasional strong growth surprises. This multiple is not punitive and leaves room for multiple expansion if consistency improves.
*   **Implied Price Upside:** If the market re-rates SKX to the higher end of its historical valuation range or if future earnings consistently beat, there is a clear pathway for the stock price to move towards its 52-week high of $78.85.

**5. The Bear Case (Key Risks & Mitigants):**

*   **Inconsistent Earnings Surprises:** While many beats exist, recent performance (Q2 2024 miss, Q4 2024 miss) shows inconsistency in meeting or exceeding expectations, which can erode investor confidence and lead to increased volatility.
*   **Lack of Qualitative Context:** The absence of qualitative news summaries or business segment details makes it impossible to understand the drivers of past performance or forecast future trends with confidence. Without this context, any investment is inherently speculative.
*   **"N/A" Price and Lack of Specifics:** The missing current price data requires an assumption based on P/E and LTM EPS, which introduces uncertainty. This also highlights a critical gap in the provided data for a robust investment decision.
*   **Forward-Looking Estimates:** The estimated EPS for Q2 2025 is $0.833, significantly lower than the preceding Q1'25 reported EPS of $1.34. A miss on this lower estimate could signal decelerating growth or increased challenges.
*   **Competitive Pressures:** In the absence of competitive analysis, an inherently competitive consumer discretionary market poses a risk. SKX's ability to maintain or grow market share is unknown.

**6. Valuation Analysis:**

*   Based on the provided data, SKX trades at a P/E ratio of 15.17.
*   Calculating the Last Twelve Months (LTM) EPS from the provided historical earnings (Q2 2024 to Q1 2025): $0.91 (Q2'24) + $1.26 (Q3'24) + $0.65 (Q4'24) + $1.34 (Q1'25) = $4.16.
*   Using the LTM EPS of $4.16 and the P/E of 15.17, the implied share price is approximately $4.16 * 15.17 = $63.10. This implied price sits roughly in the middle of its 52-week range ($44.5 - $78.85), suggesting the market is neither overly bullish nor bearish at its current multiple.
*   **Qualitative Discussion:** The valuation appears reasonable when considering the demonstrated LTM earnings power. The recent positive surprise in Q1 2025 is accretive to this LTM EPS, indicating that fundamental earnings generation is healthy. However, the lack of full financial statements (revenue, margins, cash flow, debt) limits the ability to perform a comprehensive valuation. If SKX can maintain or improve its recent earnings surprise trend, its current P/E offers potential for multiple expansion, making the recent news (Q1 2025 beat) potentially accretive to its perceived intrinsic value. Conversely, a reversion to the mean or persistent misses would justify a lower multiple.

**7. Capital Allocation & Management Quality:**

*   No information regarding management's strategy, capital allocation, or share buybacks/dividends was provided in the quantitative data or qualitative news summaries. Therefore, no assessment can be made on this front.

**8. Recommendation & Portfolio Implementation:**

We maintain a **Tactical Long / Monitor** recommendation for SKX. The company's recent Q1 2025 EPS beat provides a positive data point following a mixed period. Historically, SKX has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to analyst expectations, suggesting a potential for underestimated operational strength or effective expectation management.

However, the lack of comprehensive qualitative information (business segments, competitive landscape, strategic initiatives, macro trends) and full financial statements is a significant limitation. This prevents a high-conviction long position. We recommend monitoring future earnings reports closely, especially the upcoming Q2 2025 report, for signs of sustained positive momentum. An allocation should be sized commensurate with the medium conviction and data limitations. Further fundamental due diligence beyond the provided data is strongly advised for a higher conviction investment.
