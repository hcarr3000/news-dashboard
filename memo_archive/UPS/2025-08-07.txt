**INVESTMENT MEMO**
**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** GEM-PM
**Date:** August 08, 2025 (Updated)
**Subject:** Investment Thesis Update for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)

**Key Updates & Thesis Changes:**

*   **Direct Operational Pricing Power:** UPS has implemented a significant change to its dimensional weight calculation, now rounding all fractional measurements up to the next whole inch, mirroring FedEx. This directly increases effective shipping rates for customers, acting as a clear, tangible tailwind for revenue and profitability.
*   **Intensified Macro Headwinds (Consumer Spending):** New federal SNAP benefit cuts and tightened eligibility criteria are projected to significantly reduce consumer purchasing power, particularly for lower-income households. This presents a material and widespread negative impact on overall package volumes, intensifying the "soft consumer discretionary" and "tariff uncertainty" concerns.
*   **Offsetting Forces Elevate Risk Profile:** While the new pricing strategy provides a strong, direct operational lever for UPS to maintain or grow revenue per package, the deepened macro pressures on consumer demand introduce significant volume uncertainty. This creates a more complex risk/reward dynamic, requiring careful monitoring.

**1. Executive Summary & Investment Thesis:**
*   **Recommendation:** Tactical Long
*   **Price Target & Time Horizon:** $115.00 within 12-18 months, representing approximately 17.9% upside from the implied current price of $97.50.
*   **Thesis Summary (The Variant Perception):** The market continues to assign a cautious valuation to UPS (P/E of 12.91), largely pricing in the cyclical downturn and recent EPS deceleration. Our variant perception is that this valuation still underappreciates the company's demonstrated pricing power and operational levers that can drive earnings stabilization, even amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty.
    *   **Pricing Power & Revenue Enhancement:** The recent change to dimensional weight calculations represents a direct, effective way for UPS to extract more revenue per package, demonstrating management's ability to implement value-accretive pricing strategies.
    *   **Market Share Opportunity:** Labor disruptions at Canada Post, while not newly reported, continue to offer a near-term, tangible market share gain opportunity that can provide volume support.
    *   **Regulatory Relief Potential:** The proposed reversal of the 2009 EPA emissions framework for heavy-duty trucks (reinforced by broader Trump administration anti-regulation signals in other sectors like green steel) could alleviate significant future compliance costs or provide operational flexibility.
    *   **Attractive Entry Point:** The current P/E suggests the market has largely discounted past challenges and is likely overly focused on volume risks, leaving room for multiple expansion if pricing power offsets volume declines and positive catalysts materialize.
*   **Key Catalysts:**
    *   Sustained labor unrest or operational challenges at Canada Post, leading to a prolonged shift of package volumes to UPS.
    *   Successful finalization of the EPA emissions framework reversal, resulting in clear cost savings or avoidance of anticipated capital expenditures.
    *   Demonstrated ability of the new dimensional weight pricing to bolster revenue and offset volume pressures in upcoming quarterly reports.
    *   Signs of a bottoming out or modest recovery in overall package volumes, potentially aided by selective strength in certain retail segments (e.g., Anthropologie's performance).
*   **Conviction Level:** Medium. The direct operational benefit from the dimensional weight change is a strong, concrete positive. However, this is significantly counterbalanced by the new and intensifying macroeconomic headwinds related to consumer spending and tariffs. The path to upside is clearer operationally, but macro risks are now more pronounced.

**2. Business & Competitive Landscape:**
*   **Business Model:** United Parcel Service (UPS) is a global leader in logistics and package delivery, generating revenue from diverse shipping services. The latest news reinforces its critical dependence on global trade flows, the health of the retail sector (including e-commerce), and the regulatory environment. The implementation of the dimensional weight change underscores management's ability to exert pricing power and optimize revenue per package, a crucial lever in a challenging volume environment.
*   **Competitive Moat:** UPS's competitive moat, primarily its vast global network and infrastructure, appears to be widening tactically due to two factors. Firstly, the ongoing Canada Post labor issues continue to divert volume to private carriers. Secondly, by mirroring FedEx's dimensional weight rounding, UPS demonstrates a unified approach to pricing in the duopoly, suggesting collective pricing power within the parcel delivery industry. This ability to extract more revenue per unit strengthens the moat by enhancing profitability, even as volume growth remains uncertain. However, the capital-intensive nature and vulnerability to macroeconomic shifts (like the significant SNAP cuts impacting consumer spending and persistent tariff uncertainties) remain inherent challenges.

**3. Synthesis of Recent Information & Scuttlebutt:**
*   **News Flow Analysis:**
    *   **Direct Positives for UPS:**
        *   **Dimensional Weight Change:** UPS will begin rounding all fractional package dimensions up to the next whole inch starting August 18, matching FedEx. This directly increases effective shipping costs for customers, boosting UPS's revenue per package and demonstrating pricing power. (e.g., "$32,678 annually" extra for one customer).
        *   **Canada Post Unrest (Reinforced):** While not new information, the previous memo's positive catalyst of Canada Post labor issues continues to be a relevant tailwind for volume diversion.
        *   **Regulatory Environment (Indirectly Reinforced):** The Trump administration's broader stance against "overreach" in environmental regulations, as seen in the stalling of "green steel" projects due to shifts in energy priorities, indirectly supports the likelihood of the previously identified EPA emissions framework reversal benefiting heavy-duty trucks.
    *   **Direct Negatives/Headwinds for UPS:**
        *   **Major SNAP Benefit Cuts & Eligibility Changes:** A new spending and tax bill includes $186 billion in SNAP cuts over 10 years, expanding work requirements and limiting eligibility. States are also restricting items. Grocers anticipate a 6.7% sales hit on SNAP participants, directly impacting packaged goods and overall consumer spending, which is a core volume driver for UPS. This is a significant direct hit to consumer demand.
    *   **Indirect Negatives/Headwinds (Macro):**
        *   **Persistent Tariff Uncertainty:** Continues to impact various industries, with Ford, Columbia Sportswear, and coffee producers explicitly citing tariffs weighing on financials or outlooks. This implies ongoing disruption to international trade and supply chains, affecting UPS's global freight volumes.
        *   **Soft Consumer Discretionary:** US RevPAR for Choice Hotels is softening due to "macroeconomic uncertainty" and declines in international inbound/government travel. Women's financial health data indicates broader consumer financial stress. These reinforce concerns about overall consumer spending, a key determinant of parcel volumes.
        *   **Labor Relations:** While not specific to UPS, the Wells Fargo union complaint highlights ongoing labor friction and NLRB actions, reminding of the potential for labor-related operational challenges or increased costs for unionized workforces like UPS's Teamsters.
    *   **Indirect Positives/Offsets:**
        *   **Selective Retail Strength:** Anthropologie's successful transition of Maeve to a standalone brand, with strong net and comparable sales growth for Urban Outfitters Inc., suggests that not all parts of the consumer discretionary sector are uniformly weak, offering some counter-balance to "At Home" closures.
    *   **Tone:** The overall tone is now more complex. The direct pricing power from the dimensional weight change is a strong, quantifiable positive for UPS's top line. However, the pervasive and impactful SNAP cuts, coupled with existing tariff and general consumer spending weaknesses, present a formidable headwind on overall package volumes. The narrative is one of a company leveraging its pricing power to mitigate significant macro challenges, rather than riding clear macro tailwinds.

**4. The Bull Case (Primary Drivers):**
*   **Enhanced Pricing Power via Dimensional Weight:** The decision to round up all fractional package dimensions directly increases the effective rate per package, providing a significant and immediate boost to revenue and margin, even if volumes remain flat or decline slightly. This shows a proactive management approach to yield optimization.
*   **Continued Volume Diversion from Canada Post:** The unresolved labor dispute at Canada Post remains a direct opportunity for UPS to absorb displaced shipping volumes, potentially leading to sustained market share gains in a key North American market.
*   **Favorable Regulatory Environment (EPA):** The Trump administration's consistent anti-regulatory stance, indirectly supported by the "green steel" news, enhances the probability of the proposed reversal of the 2009 EPA emissions framework for heavy-duty trucking materializing. This would translate into lower future operating expenses and deferred capital expenditures for UPS.
*   **Undervalued Relative to Potential:** The current P/E ratio of 12.91, implying a price of $97.50, still places the stock closer to its 52-week low. This conservative valuation largely discounts recent EPS declines and ongoing uncertainties, providing an attractive entry point if the combined effect of pricing power and volume stabilization (from Canada Post) can drive even modest earnings recovery.
*   **Resilient Business Model in Certain Segments:** Despite overall consumer weakness, the success of Anthropologie's brand expansion suggests continued strength in certain retail niches, which could provide pockets of volume stability for UPS's e-commerce deliveries.

**5. The Bear Case (Key Risks & Mitigants):**
*   **Persistent & Worsening Macroeconomic Weakness:** The substantial federal SNAP benefit cuts and tightened eligibility, coupled with ongoing tariff uncertainties and softening US RevPAR in the hospitality sector, pose a significant threat to overall consumer purchasing power and package volumes. This could severely depress demand for UPS's services, especially in domestic ground and e-commerce.
*   **Swift Resolution of Canada Post Disputes:** A rapid and amicable resolution to Canada Post's labor issues could see diverted volumes return to the national carrier, diminishing UPS's short-term market share gains.
*   **Regulatory Reversal Fails/Delayed:** While likely, the EPA's proposed reversal of the emissions framework could still face legal challenges or political hurdles, delaying or preventing the anticipated cost benefits from materializing fully.
*   **Competitive Pressure & Price Sensitivity:** Despite the duopoly's aligned dimensional weight strategy, intense competition from rivals like FedEx and Amazon's logistics network could pressure margins if volume declines intensify, leading to potential price wars or an inability to sustain higher effective rates.
*   **Labor Costs & Union Negotiations:** The broader context of labor disputes (as seen with Wells Fargo) highlights the inherent sensitivity of the logistics industry to labor relations. Future wage negotiations with its own unionized workforce (Teamsters) or potential strikes could impact UPS's operational costs and service delivery.

**6. Valuation Analysis:**
Based on the provided quantitative data, the Last Twelve Months (LTM) EPS remains consistent with the previous memo:
*   Q2 2025: $1.55
*   Q1 2025: $1.49
*   Q4 2024: $2.75
*   Q3 2024: $1.76
*   LTM EPS = $1.55 + $1.49 + $2.75 + $1.76 = $7.55

The new P/E Ratio provided is 12.91.
*   Implied Current Price = P/E Ratio * LTM EPS = 12.91 * $7.55 = $97.50

This implied price of $97.50 is still significantly closer to the 52-week low ($84.28) than the 52-week high ($138.94). This indicates the market continues to apply a depressed multiple, reflecting the prior EPS decline and pervasive macroeconomic uncertainties.

The new information, particularly the dimensional weight change, is directly **accretive** to UPS's per-package revenue and thus its valuation, as it translates directly into higher effective rates without requiring volume growth. This operational lever provides a crucial offset to the intensifying macroeconomic headwinds, such as the SNAP benefit cuts, which threaten overall package volumes. If UPS can demonstrate that its pricing power can effectively mitigate the macro-induced volume slowdown, it could lead to:
1.  **EPS Stability or Modest Growth:** The increased revenue per package could stabilize or even modestly grow EPS, even if total volumes face headwinds.
2.  **Multiple Expansion:** As the market recognizes UPS's ability to maintain profitability through pricing adjustments despite a soft environment, the P/E multiple could expand from its current depressed level. The current low multiple continues to offer a margin of safety, making UPS attractive for a re-rating if these operational efficiencies prove resilient against the macro backdrop.

**[INSERT VALUATION CHART]**
*(A typical institutional memo would include a chart here, displaying historical P/E ranges, forward P/E, EV/EBITDA, and comparative multiples against peers like FedEx, potentially showing the current implied price relative to the 52-week range and analysts' consensus targets.)*

**7. Capital Allocation & Management Quality:**
The latest news, specifically the implementation of the dimensional weight rounding strategy, provides a tangible insight into UPS's management quality and capital allocation. This move, mirroring FedEx, signifies a focus on **yield management** and the ability to extract more value from existing operational infrastructure. It suggests a management team willing to make decisions that directly bolster revenue and profitability per package, even if it might entail some customer friction. This strategic pricing action, in the face of macro uncertainty, implies a disciplined approach to optimizing financial performance and a strong understanding of their market power. While explicit details on capital allocation (e.g., dividends, share repurchases, network investments) are still limited in the provided news, this pricing decision points to a management capable of proactive revenue-enhancing measures to support shareholder value.

**8. Recommendation & Portfolio Implementation:**
We reiterate our **Tactical Long** recommendation for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS). While the macroeconomic landscape has become more challenging with the significant SNAP cuts and persistent tariff concerns, the company has demonstrated a powerful direct lever through its dimensional weight pricing adjustment. This ability to capture higher revenue per package, coupled with existing tailwinds from Canada Post and potential regulatory relief, provides a compelling counter-narrative to the volume-centric bear arguments. The stock's current valuation remains attractive at a price point near its 52-week low, offering a favorable risk/reward profile for investors who believe UPS can navigate volume headwinds through disciplined pricing and operational efficiency. This position requires active monitoring for the realized impact of the pricing changes and any further shifts in consumer spending or global trade policies.
