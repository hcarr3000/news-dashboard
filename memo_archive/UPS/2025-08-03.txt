**INVESTMENT MEMO**
**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** GEM-PM
**Date:** August 03, 2025
**Subject:** Investment Thesis for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)

**1. Executive Summary & Investment Thesis:**
*   **Recommendation:** Tactical Long
*   **Price Target & Time Horizon:** $115.00 within 12-18 months, representing approximately 21% upside from the implied current price of $94.90.
*   **Thesis Summary (The Variant Perception):** The market currently assigns a cautious valuation to UPS (P/E of 12.57), largely pricing in the cyclical downturn and recent EPS deceleration from peak levels. Our variant perception is that this valuation underappreciates several emerging operational tailwinds and the potential for earnings stabilization and modest recovery.
    *   **Market Share Opportunity:** Labor disruptions at Canada Post are actively diverting volume to private carriers like UPS, offering a near-term, tangible market share gain opportunity.
    *   **Regulatory Relief:** The proposed reversal of the 2009 EPA emissions framework for heavy-duty trucks could alleviate significant future compliance costs or provide operational flexibility for UPS's extensive ground fleet.
    *   **Earnings Stabilization Potential:** While recent EPS performance has been mixed, the latest LTM EPS indicates a potential bottoming out after a significant decline from 2022-2023 highs.
    *   **Attractive Entry Point:** The current P/E suggests the market has largely discounted past challenges, leaving room for multiple expansion if positive catalysts materialize.
*   **Key Catalysts:**
    *   Sustained labor unrest or operational challenges at Canada Post, leading to a prolonged shift of package volumes to UPS.
    *   Successful finalization of the EPA emissions framework reversal, resulting in clear cost savings or avoidance of anticipated capital expenditures.
    *   Confirmation of EPS stabilization and sequential growth in upcoming quarterly earnings reports (e.g., Q3 2025 and Q4 2025).
    *   Broader macroeconomic stabilization, particularly in consumer discretionary spending, which could boost overall package volumes.
*   **Conviction Level:** Medium. The direct operational benefits from competitor issues and regulatory changes are compelling. However, the macro environment, characterized by ongoing tariff uncertainties and a soft consumer discretionary sector, warrants a measured approach.

**2. Business & Competitive Landscape:**
*   **Business Model:** United Parcel Service (UPS) is a global leader in logistics and package delivery. Its primary revenue streams are derived from a diverse array of shipping services, including domestic and international ground and air freight, as well as supply chain and freight forwarding solutions. The provided news highlights its critical dependence on global trade flows, the health of the retail sector (particularly e-commerce volumes), and the regulatory environment governing transportation and logistics.
*   **Industry Deep Dive:** The logistics industry is at a crossroads. While core demand remains, macro headwinds are evident. The "At Home store closures accelerate" article underscores continued struggles in the home goods and broader consumer discretionary retail sectors, implying reduced package volumes for these segments. Furthermore, the "Ford takes out $3B loan amid tariff uncertainty" article points to ongoing global trade policy risks (e.g., tariffs) that could impact international shipping volumes and supply chain costs for manufacturers, indirectly affecting UPS. Conversely, the "Canada Post workers reject contract proposals" news presents a significant opportunity for market share gains, as shippers divert volume away from the disrupted national postal service to private carriers. The "EPA seeks to reverse 2009 emissions framework" suggests a potential easing of environmental regulations for heavy-duty trucks, a positive development for an industry heavily reliant on large vehicle fleets.
*   **Competitive Moat:** UPS's competitive moat is primarily derived from its vast, integrated global network, extensive fleet, advanced technology infrastructure, and brand recognition. The news suggests a temporary widening of this moat due to Canada Post's labor issues, as a key competitor faces disruptions, allowing UPS to capture displaced volumes. The potential regulatory changes from the EPA could further enhance UPS's cost efficiency relative to some competitors, depending on their existing fleet composition and compliance strategies. However, the capital-intensive nature of the business and vulnerability to macroeconomic shifts (like tariffs and consumer spending) are inherent challenges.

**3. Synthesis of Recent Information & Scuttlebutt:**
*   **News Flow Analysis:**
    *   **Direct Positives:** The rejection of Canada Post's contract offers by its workers is a clear boon for UPS. History suggests such labor disruptions lead to sustained volume diversion to alternative carriers. The proposed reversal of the EPA's 2009 emissions framework could significantly reduce future capital expenditures or operating costs for UPS by eliminating stringent requirements for its heavy-duty truck fleet.
    *   **Indirect Negatives/Headwinds:** The acceleration of "At Home" store closures signals continued weakness in the consumer discretionary sector, which could depress overall package volumes, particularly for e-commerce. Ford's securing of a $3B loan due to "tariff uncertainty" highlights ongoing global trade tensions and potential supply chain disruptions, which could impact international shipping and freight volumes.
    *   **Tone:** The tone is mixed but leans opportunistically positive for UPS. While broader economic concerns (consumer spending, tariffs) persist as a background hum, the specific events related to Canada Post and EPA offer concrete, company-specific tailwinds that could drive performance.

**4. The Bull Case (Primary Drivers):**
*   **Significant Volume Diversion from Canada Post:** The ongoing labor dispute at Canada Post presents a direct, immediate opportunity for UPS to absorb displaced shipping volumes, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share gains that could persist even after Canada Post's issues are resolved.
*   **Favorable Regulatory Environment (EPA):** The Trump administration's efforts to reverse the 2009 EPA emissions framework would reduce regulatory burden and compliance costs for heavy-duty trucking. For UPS, this could translate into lower operating expenses, deferral of costly fleet upgrades, and improved profitability.
*   **Undervalued Relative to Potential:** The current P/E ratio of 12.57 implies an implied price of approximately $94.90 (based on LTM EPS of $7.55), placing the stock near its 52-week low. This suggests that a significant portion of the recent earnings decline and market uncertainty is already priced in, offering an attractive entry point for investors if the catalysts materialize.
*   **Earnings Stabilization/Recovery:** After a period of decline from peak EPS levels (e.g., $12.64 in CY2022 to $7.26 in CY2024), recent quarterly performance shows signs of potential stabilization. The positive surprise track record in late 2024 and early 2025, despite a recent miss, indicates that the trough might be near, setting the stage for a modest recovery.

**5. The Bear Case (Key Risks & Mitigants):**
*   **Persistent Macroeconomic Weakness:** Continued contraction in consumer discretionary spending (e.g., evidenced by At Home closures) and escalation of global trade disputes/tariffs could depress overall package volumes and international freight, offsetting any company-specific gains.
*   **Swift Resolution of Canada Post Disputes:** A quick and amicable resolution to Canada Post's labor issues could see diverted volumes return to the incumbent, diminishing UPS's short-term market share gains.
*   **Regulatory Reversal Fails/Delayed:** The EPA's proposed reversal of the emissions framework could face significant legal challenges or political hurdles, delaying or preventing the anticipated cost benefits from materializing.
*   **Competitive Pressure:** Intense competition from rivals like FedEx and Amazon's logistics network, coupled with potential price wars, could pressure margins despite any volume gains.
*   **Labor Costs & Union Negotiations:** While specific to Canada Post in the news, the broader logistics industry remains sensitive to labor relations. UPS itself has a unionized workforce (Teamsters), and future wage negotiations or potential strikes could impact operational costs and service delivery.

**6. Valuation Analysis:**
Based on the provided data, UPS currently trades at a P/E ratio of 12.57. To derive an implied current price, we calculate the Last Twelve Months (LTM) EPS from the provided historical earnings data:
*   Q2 2025: $1.55
*   Q1 2025: $1.49
*   Q4 2024: $2.75
*   Q3 2024: $1.76
*   LTM EPS = $1.55 + $1.49 + $2.75 + $1.76 = $7.55
*   Implied Current Price = P/E Ratio * LTM EPS = 12.57 * $7.55 = $94.90

This implied price of $94.90 is closer to the 52-week low ($84.28) than the 52-week high ($138.94). This suggests the market is assigning a relatively conservative multiple, likely reflecting the significant EPS decline from 2022 ($12.64) and 2023 ($11.35) peaks to the current LTM of $7.55, and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.

The news flow, particularly regarding the Canada Post opportunity and the EPA regulatory relief, is likely to be **accretive** to UPS's current valuation. These catalysts could lead to:
1.  **EPS Stabilization/Growth:** If the volume diversion from Canada Post is significant and sustained, it will directly boost revenue and potentially EPS. Regulatory relief from the EPA could improve margins by mitigating or reducing operational costs.
2.  **Multiple Expansion:** As earnings stabilize or begin to grow, and the market gains confidence in the sustainability of these improvements, the P/E multiple could expand from its current depressed level. A return to a more historically normalized multiple, or even a slight re-rating reflecting improved operating conditions, could drive significant stock price appreciation. The current low multiple acts as a margin of safety, making UPS attractive if these positive operational shifts occur.

**[INSERT VALUATION CHART]**
*(A typical institutional memo would include a chart here, displaying historical P/E ranges, forward P/E, EV/EBITDA, and comparative multiples against peers like FedEx, potentially showing the current implied price relative to the 52-week range and analysts' consensus targets.)*

**7. Capital Allocation & Management Quality:**
The provided news does not offer explicit details on UPS's specific capital allocation decisions, dividend policy, or share repurchase programs. However, as a capital-intensive business in global logistics, management quality is inherently linked to its ability to efficiently deploy capital into its network, fleet, and technology infrastructure while navigating cyclical demand and regulatory changes. The positive implications from the Canada Post situation and the EPA proposal suggest a management team that is either actively benefiting from external factors or is poised to leverage policy shifts to optimize its cost structure and operational efficiency. The absence of specific mentions does not imply poor capital allocation, but rather reinforces the need for ongoing due diligence on management's strategic investments for long-term growth and shareholder returns.

**8. Recommendation & Portfolio Implementation:**
We reiterate our **Tactical Long** recommendation for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS). We believe the market's current valuation does not fully capture the near-term operational upside from competitor disruptions and potential regulatory tailwinds. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, the attractive P/E multiple at a price point near its 52-week low offers a compelling risk/reward profile. This position should be actively monitored for progression of the identified catalysts and shifts in broader economic conditions.
