Kennedy Jr. falsely claimed, against the evidence of many clinical trials, that mRNA vaccines \u201cfail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\u201d\n\nInstead, Kennedy said in the statement, HHS will shift funding toward what he described as \u201csafer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\u201d\n\nHundreds of millions of people received mRNA vaccines developed for COVID by Moderna as well as partners Pfizer and BioNTech. Testing in large clinical trials found them highly protective against the most serious outcomes of the disease and broadly safe. Additional research found an association with myocarditis in young men, but the relative risk is small and inflammation can also be caused by COVID.\n\nTheir development in record time was the product of close collaboration between the U.S. government and drugmakers during the Trump administration\u2019s first term. Unlike older vaccine technologies, mRNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and modified to better match circulating viruses, making it a vital pandemic response tool.\n\n\u201cBARDA invested in mRNA technology precisely because it could deliver safe, scalable vaccines in record time, a capability proven during COVID. By dismantling that platform, we\u2019re crippling our front-line defense, just ahead of unknown biological threats,\u201d Rick Bright, the director of BARDA during the first Trump administration, wrote in a post on X.\n\nPaul Offit, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that mRNA technology could help scientists respond more quickly in the event of another pandemic than older methods like whole-killed virus vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt's a giant step backward for science,\u201d Offit added in an interview. \u201cThe research and development that was being done by BARDA was getting us ready for the future and this makes our future less bright.\u201d\n\nKennedy, a vaccine skeptic who for years criticized mRNA technology, has taken steps since becoming HHS secretary that experts fear weaken the country\u2019s public health. He fired a vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and replaced its members with hand-picked successors who share many of his views. He changed CDC recommendations for COVID vaccines in pregnant women and children, while the Food and Drug Administration, which he oversees, has set strict approval standards for the shots.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses,\u201d Kennedy said in a video on the social media site X.\n\nHHS said that, outside of vaccine development, other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by the announcement.",

The company has lost nearly half of its share value this year, announced a CEO switch and, just last week, cut its financial forecasts.\n\nBut on July 1, Wegovy became the preferred anti-obesity medication on the national formulary for CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, giving Novo a leg up on Zepbound in the tens of millions of American patients covered by the company\u2019s plans. That decision has shifted patients to Wegovy \u201clargely in line with what we expected,\u201d said Novo\u2019s U.S. operations head Dave Moore, on a conference call with analysts.\n\nNovo will also accelerate a recent push into direct-to-consumer channels for Wegovy, an initiative that\u2019s part of a broader trend among pharmaceutical companies. While direct-to-consumer marketing fueled an increase of total Wegovy cash-pay prescriptions from 4% to 10% in the U.S. since January, growth has been slower than expected, according to Moore. The company \u201cwill continue to invest\u201d in the expansion of those channels, he added.\n\nThose efforts, however, will likely necessitate a price cut for Wegovy in the second half of the year to make the drug more attractive to those paying cash and \u201creduce friction\u201d for insured people, CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen said.\n\nDrug compounders, meanwhile, pounced on an earlier supply shortage of Wegovy and Zepbound and have eaten into Novo\u2019s sales in particular. Though the Food and Drug Administration has since declared the shortage over, companies have justified continued marketing of copycat versions by offering \u201cpersonalization\u201d that adjusts doses or adds vitamins.\n\nNovo executives said they\u2019re pressing the FDA to enforce bans on compounded Wegovy. Earlier this week, the company also announced it\u2019s filed 14 new lawsuits seeking to block sales, bringing the total number of court cases it\u2019s started to 132.\n\nStill, a broad change to federal law may be necessary to stop sales, as compounders are currently taking advantage of a legal loophole. \u201cThere is nothing categorically that is off the table\u201d in terms of litigation, Moore said.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it recorded net sales of 76.8 billion kroner, or $12 billion, between April and June, a 13% increase over the same period in 2024. Net profits of 26.5 billion kroner represented a 32% jump versus the second quarter last year.\n\nNovo shares fell another 4% in morning trading Wednesday.",

Chief among the seven new programs is an oral GLP-1 agonist that Nxera says is based on \"differentiated chemistry\" and is distinct from a compound it discovered together with Pfizer under a research alliance. Coincidentally, Pfizer disclosed Tuesday it discontinued development of that compound, a decision Nxera said was made \u201cdue to a portfolio decision.\u201d \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nSeres Therapeutics is talking with \u201cmultiple parties\u201d to secure additional capital in support of developing a microbiome drug called SER-155. The company said Wednesday that it's evaluating a range of options, including partnerships, licensing deals and mergers. Seres needs funding to run a Phase 2 study of SER-155 as a preventive treatment for bloodstream infections in people undergoing stem cell transplant. The company, which last year sold to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science full rights of its microbiome pill Vowst, recently appointed two co-CEOs to replace its chief executive of six years, Eric Shaff, who left in July. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nBridgeBio Pharma\u2019s heart drug Attruby, which competes with medicines from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer, booked $71.5 million in U.S. net revenue during the second quarter, the company said Tuesday. As of the start of August, more than 1,000 unique prescribers had written 3,751 prescriptions for the drug, up from 756 and 2,072, respectively, on April 25. BridgeBio estimates it is capturing about 18% to 20% of new prescriptions and, according to Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed, its results indicate an \u201cacceleration\u201d despite the recent approval of Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra. Still, total sales came in below \u201celevated investor expectations\u201d of \u201cmid-to-high $70s,\u201d according to Leerink Partners\u2019 Mani Foroohar. Company shares fell by more than 10% Wednesday morning. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nSales of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Rezdiffra again surpassed Wall Street forecasts, pushing company shares up by 15%. Madrigal said Tuesday that Rezdiffra, which is currently the only approved medicine for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, generated about $213 million in the second quarter. More than 23,000 patients were on treatment at the end of June. The sales results topped consensus estimates by $50 million and led multiple analysts to boost their financial projections in 2025 and beyond. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Prakhar Agrawal, for instance, now predicts more than $850 million in Rezdiffra sales this year and over $1.2 billion in 2026. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical this week said it discontinued a drug candidate in preclinical development for the rare disease phenylketonuria after early immune response data didn\u2019t meet the company\u2019s bar for advancement. As a result, BioMarin will redeploy the employees who worked on the program, dubbed BMN 390, to other areas.

Seres Therapeutics seeks new capital for its SER-155 microbiome drug's Phase 2 study, considering partnerships and mergers. BridgeBio Pharma's Attruby sales of $71.5 million missed elevated investor expectations, while Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' Rezdiffra sales of $213 million surpassed forecasts, driving its shares up 15%. BioMarin Pharmaceutical discontinued its preclinical PKU drug candidate BMN 390 due to early immune response data.\n\n**Why it matters:** Madrigal's Rezdiffra sales significantly exceeding forecasts challenge any prior skepticism about its market adoption and financial trajectory as the sole approved MASH drug. Conversely, BridgeBio's Attruby sales falling below elevated investor expectations, despite prescription growth, suggests that the market's previous bullish consensus on its immediate revenue potential might have been overstated. Nxera's unveiled obesity pipeline, distinct from a discontinued Pfizer collaboration, indicates a new independent strategy in a competitive and high-value therapeutic area, potentially signaling a shift in future market dynamics for obesity drugs.\n\n**The big picture:** The pharmaceutical landscape sees companies navigating both pipeline advancements and financial pressures, with a mix of successes and setbacks in drug commercialization.

However, lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives appear more worried about U.S. companies handing technology to Chinese firms than they are about the China-to-U.S. partnerships that have become increasingly common.\n\n\u201cThe sensitivity is way more on things that we transfer there than vice versa,\u201d Bourla said. Still, he cautioned drugmakers \u201cneed to be careful\u201d because China is \u201cvery high on the radar\u201d of U.S. policymakers.\n\nChina\u2019s biotech sector has made rapid progress over the last decade, boosted by government support, regulatory flexibility and a skilled workforce that\u2019s launched scores of homegrown companies. Growth has accelerated in recent years, culminating in an frenzy of dealmaking and drug research that\u2019s challenging U.S. leadership in the life sciences.\n\nA report published by the investment bank Jefferies last month found one-third of the money the drug industry spent on licensing deals in the first half of 2025 involved China-originated medicines, compared to 21% in 2023 and 2024 and single-digit percentages before that. Their tally included a multibillion-dollar deal inked with Shenyang-based 3SBio in May for a cancer drug Pfizer sees as critical to its future oncology plans.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s conference call, Bourla ticked off other indicators of China\u2019s biotech gains: China now rivals the U.S. in clinical trial activity, while Chinese scientists are responsible for a large share of scientific journal publications on CRISPR gene editing and structural biology. Chinese researchers have also filed more patents than their U.S. counterparts this year, Bourla added, which has helped draw private investment to the country\u2019s biotechs.\n\n\u201cThis is happening. It\u2019s real,\u201d Bourla said. \u201cI\u2019ve explained all of that to the [Trump] administration.\u201d\n\nCompetition from China has heightened pressure on a U.S. biotech industry that\u2019s reeling from a yearslong slowdown in funding. A bipartisan commission in April warned the U.S. could lose its once-decisive edge if it doesn\u2019t direct billions of dollars toward strengthening the country\u2019s biotech sector. It also called for a more proactive government strategy.\n\n\u201cThe biotech industry needs to be supported by the government, by Congress,\u201d said Bourla, who also currently chairs the industry lobbying organization PhRMA.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has made countering China a chief objective, it\u2019s also moved to cut science funding and shrink the agencies that oversee drug companies and research. In Congress, lawmakers have focused on how they might stop data and intellectual property flowing from the U.S. to China, weighing a bill, the Biosecure Act, that would have restricted U.S. biotechs from working with certain China-based contractors. It stalled out last year, however.\n\nThe recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided some tailwind to domestic drugmakers, which can now deduct some R&D expenses immediately rather than amortizing them over several years.\n\nBourla said that, in his conversations with members of Congress, he didn\u2019t hear any apparent concern over Pfizer\u2019s deal with 3SBio. \u201cI explained that we didn\u2019t give anything,\u201d he said, and that Pfizer instead plans to take 3SBio\u2019s drug, develop it globally and manufacture it in the U.S.\n\nLicensing deals like those pose a different sort of threat to smaller U.S. biotech firms, which often count on partnering with pharma to bring in needed cash and validation. More helpful to U.S. biotech might be new policies to speed drug development, which currently proceeds far more quickly and at a lower cost in China.\n\n\u201cYou won't slow them down. They are very good,\u201d Bourla said, of China\u2019s biotech companies. \u201cWhat we can do is to focus to be better than that, and that should be our goal.\u201d\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Martin Makary has floated multiple ideas to accelerate development, among them phasing out animal testing for certain medicines and using artificial intelligence to assist with reviews.",

He noted his conversations with Congress did not raise concerns about Pfizer's deal with 3SBio, as Pfizer plans to develop and manufacture the drug in the U.S.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information clarifies the nuanced focus of U.S. policymakers regarding China's biotech sector. While general concern exists about China's \"emerging superiority,\" the emphasis is on preventing U.S. technology outflow rather than restricting U.S. companies licensing China-originated medicines. This distinction challenges any broad consensus that all U.S.-China biotech collaborations face similar political hurdles. For investors, it suggests a potentially clearer path for U.S. drugmakers seeking to license Chinese assets for global development. It also highlights that smaller U.S. biotech firms might need new policies to speed domestic drug development to compete effectively.\n\n**The big picture:**\nChina's biotech sector has advanced rapidly over the past decade, driven by government support, regulatory flexibility, and a skilled workforce. This progress has led to significant dealmaking and drug research, now challenging U.S. leadership in life sciences. This rise occurs while the U.S. biotech industry experiences a prolonged funding slowdown. U.S. lawmakers express bipartisan concern about China's biotech advancements, though their current focus is primarily on preventing U.S. technology transfer to China.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   One-third of drug industry licensing money in H1 2025 involved China-originated medicines.\n*   This compares to 21% in 2023-2024 and single-digit percentages prior.\n*   China now rivals the U.S. in clinical trial activity.\n*   Chinese researchers filed more patents than U.S. counterparts this year.\n*   Chinese scientists are responsible for a large share of scientific journal publications on CRISPR gene editing and structural biology.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Albert Bourla:** Pfizer CEO, described lawmaker views on China biotech, chairs industry lobbying organization PhRMA.\n*   **Pfizer:** U.S. drugmaker, signed a multibillion-dollar deal for a cancer drug with 3SBio.\n*   **3SBio:** Shenyang-based company, inked a multibillion-dollar cancer drug deal with Pfizer in May.\n*   **Jefferies:** Investment bank, published a report on drug industry licensing deals involving China.\n*   **PhRMA:** Industry lobbying organization, currently chaired by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.\n*   **Trump administration:** Made countering China a chief objective, also moved to cut science funding.\n*   **Martin Makary:** Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, proposed ideas to accelerate U.S. drug development.\n*   **Democrats:** Lawmakers sharing angst over China's biotech sector with Republicans.\n*   **Republicans:** Lawmakers sharing angst over China's biotech sector with Democrats.\n*   **Senate:** Lawmakers appear more worried about U.S. technology transfer to Chinese firms.\n*   **House of Representatives:** Lawmakers appear more worried about U.S. technology transfer to Chinese firms.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nU.S. policy targets tech transfer to China, not necessarily licensing of Chinese drugs.",

The company previously launched a direct-to-consumer service that allows patients to book telehealth appointments, schedule vaccinations and fill prescriptions for certain medicines, such as those Pfizer sells for migraine and COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe think it is a fantastic way to go ahead, so we will work collaboratively to do it,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nObesity drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also recently opened up more ways for cash-paying patients to access their weight loss medicines directly. Other companies are signaling interest, too, in exploring ways to sidestep pharmacy benefit managers. These drug-purchasing middlemen extract from drugmakers rebates that insurers say they use to lower overall costs, but not necessarily in ways that are obvious to a prescription-filling patient.\n\nExpanding direct-to-consumer options was one of four demands Trump made of the pharmaceutical industry last week in letters issued to 17 drugmakers, including Pfizer.\n\nIn those letters, the president threatened to use \u201cevery tool\u201d the U.S. government has available if the companies don\u2019t take steps to lower the cost of their products to the prices paid in other industrialized countries. Such a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d policy could be a major blow to the industry, although analysts are divided on how sweeping its impact would be if limited only to Medicaid, as Trump indicated.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s call, Bourla said he is in \u201cactive discussions\u201d at the \u201chighest levels of the U.S. government,\u201d including conversations with Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz. In addition to leading Pfizer, Bourla is the current board chair of industry lobbying group PhRMA.\n\n\u201cThe letter asks a lot from us,\u201d Bourla added. \u201cBut we are engaged in productive discussion with them and in general I\u2019m happy with the way that they listen to us.\u201d\n\nPricing threats aren\u2019t the only challenge drugmakers face in the U.S. The Commerce Department is nearing the end of an investigation into pharmaceutical imports expected to result in sector-specific tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that his administration will initially impose a small levy on pharmaceuticals that could later rise as high as 250% over time.\n\nSuch duties would be costly for drugmakers, but analysts believe a phase-in period would allow many companies to adjust their supply chains in such a way that the worst financial hit could be mitigated. Already, most of the largest drugmakers have announced major manufacturing investments in the U.S.\n\nPfizer anticipates that it can absorb the impact of tariffs this year, as well as any changes it makes to its products\u2019 prices, while still meeting its financial forecast of $61 billion to $64 billion in revenue. On Tuesday, the company raised its guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share by 10 cents.\n\nShares in Pfizer rose by nearly 4% by midday Tuesday.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nDavid Altshuler, the renowned geneticist who\u2019s helped shape Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 research strategy over the last decade, will step down next year, the company said Monday.\n\nAlongside its quarterly earnings report, Vertex said Altshuler, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, will retire on Aug. 1, 2026 as part of a \u201cplanned transition.\u201d Mark Bunnage, Vertex\u2019s senior vice president of global research, will assume Altshuler\u2019s role on Feb. 1. He\u2019s worked alongside Altshuler since 2016 and has run discovery research at Vertex since March 2024, the company said.\n\nAltshuler was named to Vertex\u2019s board of directors in 2012 and officially hired to lead its internal and external research efforts three years later. Since then, the company has branched out from its core cystic fibrosis business and brought to market the first CRISPR gene editing therapy as well as a new kind of pain medicine. \u201cI would like to express my deep gratitude to David for his exceptional scientific vision and patient impact,\u201d CEO Reshma Kewalrami said in a statement.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhen Altshuler joined Vertex in 2015, he stepped into a company still scarred by a near-catastrophic setback.\n\nWhile Vertex had a pair of fast-selling cystic fibrosis drugs at the time, it was only a few years removed from the collapse of a once-budding hepatitis C business. Company executives attributed the business\u2019 fall to underestimating the competition and not diversifying quickly enough. They vowed to plan better in the future.\n\nAltshuler was tasked with leading that plan. A founding member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and leader of several important genetic research studies, Altshuler sought to work on conditions caused by easily identifiable genetic mutations. The idea was to do so within certain \u201cspecialty diseases\u201d \u2014 typically rare disorders for which medicines can be sold at high prices and with a small sales force. Vertex would iteratively test several similar drugs for these conditions, hoping to find medicines that stand out and then improve upon them.\n\n\u201cDisproportionate value is created when you actually open a disease,\u201d Altshuler said in an interview in 2021, contrasting the company\u2019s approach with the more typical strategy of pursuing many programs within a broad therapeutic area.\n\nVertex\u2019s strategy drew skepticism from Wall Street investors over the years. But it cemented a cystic fibrosis business that\u2019s produced five drugs and withstood multiple challenges. It also saw Vertex branch out into other areas. A partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics yielded the gene-editing blood disease drug Casgevy, which was approved by regulators in 2023. Long-running pain research led to the clearance of Journavx, an alternative to opioids, in January. Vertex\u2019s market value has more tripled since Altshuler came aboard.\n\nYet it\u2019s still not clear whether Vertex has found a second drug franchise. Casgevy\u2019s launch is going slow, and Vertex\u2019s pain medications may not become the multibillion-dollar business it envisioned. The company has shelved multiple attempts at drugs for the rare disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, as well as one of two diabetes cell therapy programs in clinical development. A yearslong collaboration with Moderna hasn\u2019t yet borne fruit.\n\nVertex is progressing two programs for two types of kidney conditions through late-stage testing, one of which was acquired in a nearly $5 billion deal last year. Another diabetes cell therapy could be submitted to regulators in 2026, and earlier research in a type of muscular dystrophy as well as a different kidney disease are ongoing.\n\nStill, \u201cone of the main questions for the stock is \u2018what\u2019s the next [cystic fibrosis]?\u201d and it\u2019s unclear whether the company\u2019s current pipeline is aimed at \u201cmarket opportunities that are meaningful enough to be narrative changing,\u201d Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a Monday note to clients.",

        "summary_text": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals made its name and fortune by developing ever more effective medicines for the rare disease cystic fibrosis. On Monday, the biotechnology company disclosed two setbacks that suggest one of its next targets for a similarly iterative approach to innovation, pain, may not go as smoothly as it and investors had hoped.\n\nAlongside earnings for the second quarter, Vertex disclosed that a successor drug to its pioneering pain medicine Journavx, which was approved this January in the U.S., failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage clinical trial. As a result, Vertex will no longer advance this follow-on compound, dubbed VX-993, into pivotal testing for acute pain treatment on its own.\n\nAt the same time, Vertex informed investors it would not start a late-stage study of Journavx in a form of sciatica, after the Food and Drug Adminsitration indicated an expanded approval in peripheral neuropathic pain would be unlikely. The company had aimed to use data from testing in sciatica and an ongoing study in diabetic neuropathy to widen Journavx\u2019s use beyond the acute pain indication it currently holds.\n\n\u201cWhile a broad [peripheral neuropathic pain] label remains our goal, at this time the FDA does not see a path to a broad indication as such,\u201d said CEO Reshma Kewalramani on a Monday evening call with investors.\n\nInstead, Vertex will start a second Phase 3 trial in diabetic neuropathy to eventually support an approval application there. According to estimates recently cited by Vertex, about 2.4 million people in the U.S. have diabetic neuropathy \u2014 about one-fifth the 11 million or so people who have peripheral neuropathic pain, which includes sciatica and other types of chronic nerve pain.\n\nShares in Vertex fell by more than 14% in post-market trading Monday on the news, which, if sustained, would translate to erasure of about $17 billion in market capitalization.\n\nPain is one of many research directions Vertex is pursuing as it seeks to become bigger than the cystic fibrosis medicines that made it one of biotech\u2019s most valuable companies. But it\u2019s arguably the company\u2019s highest profile bet, as Journavx offers an alternative to the powerful, but dangerously addictive opioid painkillers that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S.\n\nJournavx works differently, in ways that are not thought to be similarly habit-forming. While the medicine proved effective at dulling the sharp and stabbing pain that can occur after surgeries like a bunion removal or \u201ctummy tuck,\u201d data from testing showed it to be about as potent as a weak opioid.\n\nStill, analysts have penciled in billions of dollars for future Journavx sales, seeing a large market in post-surgery therapy that could later be expanded to include chronic pain treatment.\n\nGetting to that goal now looks like it will require more time and more testing. Vertex aims to finish enrolling both diabetic neuropathy studies by the end of next year and intends to keep engaging the FDA on paths toward an expansive peripheral neuropathic pain label.\n\nIn a note to clients, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said Monday\u2019s update eliminates a \u201cblue sky\u201d scenario for Vertex.\n\nThe study failure for VX-993, meanwhile, weakens Vertex\u2019s argument that the company can improve on Journvax\u2019s effectiveness with successive compounds, as it did in cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe news, Abrahams wrote, \u201creduces any potential halo effect around the pain franchise and underscores that it may be more challenging than some expected to iterate and improve upon [Journavx].\u201d\n\nPaul Matteis, an analyst at Stifel, told his bank\u2019s clients in a separate note that VX-993\u2019s failure hints Vertex \u201cmay have nearly maximized the efficacy\u201d it can extract from the way Journavx works, which is by blocking pain-regulating proteins known as NaV1.8.\n\nKewalramani acknowledged that possibility on Monday\u2019s call. \u201cThe outcome of the study combined with the totality of evidence from our preclinical models and previous NaV1.8 inhibitor clinical studies in acute pain suggest we are at the high end of the NaV1.8 dose response curve for acute pain in the post-bunionectomy setting.\u201d\n\nVertex continues to enroll a Phase 2 study testing VX-993 in diabetic neuropathic pain. And it could still combine the compound with other molecules that target a related protein called NaV1.7.\n\nYet the setbacks mean investor focus will fall more squarely on Journavx\u2019s performance on the market. There, Vertex reported $12 million in sales during the three-month period between April and June, beating Wall Street forecasts by several million dollars. More than 111,000 prescriptions have been written for the drug since it became available at pharmacies in early March, Vertex said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Vertex pain drug development hits setbacks, dampening investor hopes.\n\n**Key details:**\nVertex Pharmaceuticals disclosed two setbacks for its pain program, including a successor drug, VX-993, failing its main goal in a mid-stage trial for acute pain. As a result, VX-993 will not advance into pivotal testing on its own. Vertex also announced it would not start a late-stage study of Journavx for sciatica, after the FDA indicated an expanded approval in peripheral neuropathic pain would be unlikely. Instead, Vertex will start a second Phase 3 trial of Journavx in diabetic neuropathy to support approval.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese setbacks suggest Vertex's iterative innovation approach to pain may not go as smoothly as hoped by investors and the company. Analysts had penciled in billions for future Journavx sales, seeing a large market in post-surgery therapy that could expand to chronic pain. The news eliminates a \"blue sky\" scenario for Vertex, according to RBC Capital Markets, challenging the consensus view of rapid expansion. It also weakens the argument that Vertex can easily improve on Journavx's effectiveness with successive compounds, hinting efficacy may be maximized for its current mechanism.\n\n**The big picture:**\nVertex Pharmaceuticals gained its reputation and wealth developing effective cystic fibrosis medicines. The company is pursuing pain as a high-profile research direction to grow beyond its cystic fibrosis successes. Journavx, approved in January 2024 for acute pain, offers an alternative to addictive opioid painkillers, though data showed it is about as potent as a weak opioid.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Shares fell by more than 14% in post-market trading Monday.\n*   This translates to erasure of about $17 billion in market capitalization.\n*   Journavx sales were $12 million in the three-month period between April and June.\n*   More than 111,000 prescriptions have been written for Journavx since early March.\n*   Approximately 2.4 million people in the U.S. have diabetic neuropathy.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Vertex Pharmaceuticals:** Biotechnology company that developed cystic fibrosis medicines and is pursuing pain treatments.\n*   **Reshma Kewalramani:** CEO of Vertex, who acknowledged the potential efficacy limitations of their NaV1.8 inhibitor.\n*   **Food and Drug Administration (FDA):** U.S. regulatory body that indicated a broad Journavx approval in pain was unlikely.\n*   **RBC Capital Markets:** Financial firm whose analyst Brian Abrahams commented on Vertex's \"blue sky\" scenario.\n*   **Brian Abrahams:** Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, stated the update eliminates a \"blue sky\" scenario for Vertex.\n*   **Stifel:** Bank whose analyst Paul Matteis commented on potential efficacy maximization for Journavx.\n*   **Paul Matteis:** Analyst at Stifel, suggested Vertex may have nearly maximized Journavx's efficacy.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Vertex aims to finish enrolling both diabetic neuropathy studies by the end of next year.\n*   Vertex intends to keep engaging the FDA on paths toward an expansive peripheral neuropathic pain label.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPain drug setbacks challenge Vertex's growth strategy and market expansion hopes.",

        "summary_text": "A brain-focused biotechnology company saw a double-digit stock drop Monday morning even as it unveiled clinical trial results that some on Wall Street considered top notch.\n\nThe mid-stage study recruited adults with either of two epileptic disorders, and gave them all a drug from Praxis Precision Medicines once a day for about two months. According to Praxis, by the end of the treatment period, median seizure frequency had declined 56%.\n\nThe company also said its drug, now called vormatrigine, appeared fast-acting, with a little over half of the participants experiencing a 50% reduction in frequency in the first week of treatment. Around 22% achieved \u201cseizure freedom,\u201d meaning they stopped having seizures, at the eight-week mark.\n\nParticipants were taking an average of two other anti-seizure medications, which, Praxis noted, made it very challenging to show its drug was having a positive effect. More than 80% were on a long-established type of treatment known as \u201csodium channel blockers,\u201d with 30% taking a product sold by the South Korea-based developer SK Biopharmaceutical. Sales of that medicine, Xcopri, rose 47% between the first quarter of 2024 and the same period this year, where they reached 133.3 billion won or roughly $96 million.\n\nWhile there are many sodium channel blockers already available for the two types of seizures \u2014 \u201cfocal onset\u201d and \u201ctonic-clonic\u201d \u2014 at the center of Praxis\u2019 study, they often come with drawbacks. Some elicit side effects like dizziness or drowsiness, or need to be administered through time-consuming titrations. Xcorpi, for instance, has \u201cset the efficacy bar\u201d in focal onset seizures, yet its \u201cslow titration scheme\u201d and adverse events have \u201cdriven clinicians to reserve its use\u201d for the most severe, hard-to-treat cases, according to TD Cowen analyst Ritu Baral.\n\nIn a client note last month, Baral, who covers Praxis, wrote that key doctors in the neurology field have \u201crepeatedly underscored\u201d the need for new sodium channel drugs that avoid these problems. That\u2019s what Praxis is hoping to do with its medicine, which is taken orally.\n\nPraxis said vormatrigine was generally well tolerated. Across 61 patients, researchers saw treatment-emergent adverse events in 36. Most were mild or moderate, with the most common being dizziness, drowsiness and headache. There were three cases each of \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d adverse events, though they all resolved. Almost one in four participants discontinued the study.\n\nBaral, in her note, wrote the \u201cbest case\u201d scenario for Praxis is that its study would show a 55% or greater reduction in median monthly seizure frequency among patients with focal onset seizures. Such a result, Baral predicted, could lead to a 30-40% bump in the company\u2019s stock price.\n\nInstead, Praxis shares were down 13% by late Monday morning, to trade just under $47 apiece.\n\nTo Brian Abrahams, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, the seizure reductions seen in the trial could make vormatrigine \"reasonably competitive.\" Abrahams, though, covers Xenon Pharmaceuticals, which is developing its own seizure medication that could rival Praxis'. The analyst argued in a client note Monday that not only is Xenon years ahead in development, but Praxis' data do not yet show a \"clear efficacy advantage.\" And even if vormatrigine does eventually win approval, it would likely be used in combination with generics or other branded products like Xenon's azetukalner.\n\nPraxis plans to present more detailed data from the trial later this month, at an epilepsy medical conference in Portugal.\n\nPraxis released the trial results alongside its latest earnings report. For the three-month period from April through June, the company reported a net loss of $71.1 million, up from the $32.7 million loss recorded during the second quarter last year.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nFord Motor Co. has recalled over 56,000 F-150 pickups due to a condition where the seat belt warning chime may fail to activate to remind occupants to buckle up, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\nThe malfunction that led to the recall only affects 2025 F-150 trucks equipped with Ford\u2019s 3.5 liter, EcoBoost hybrid V6 engine.\n\nDealers will update the audio control module software for free, although Ford currently does not have a software remedy available. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed Aug. 25, with a second notice to be sent once the software update is ready.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe fault is believed to be related to a low change condition of the 12-volt battery. If the voltage is too low when starting the vehicle, the \u201cstart of trip\u201d seat belt reminder chime may not play from the vehicle\u2019s audio head unit, which could lead to decreased seat belt usage that can increase the risk of injury in a crash, per the report.\n\nA Ford employee who noticed the issue alerted the company when the seat belt chime in their hybrid F-150 wasn\u2019t audible upon startup. The employee escalated the concern to the automaker\u2019s Critical Concern Review Group on May 29.\n\nFrom June through July, Ford\u2019s investigators conducted testing and data review of the audio control module to determine the root cause. The team found that the audio head unit in F-150 pickups equipped with hybrid powertrains can be subjected to a \u201chigh-voltage interrupt\u201d during start-up, resulting in a reset condition that stops the playback of the seat belt reminder chime.\n\nBased on this initial probe, the Ford\u2019s investigators confirmed that all other vehicle chimes worked normally for approximately three seconds after the vehicle\u2019s audio head unit was reset.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s Critical Concern Review Group also conducted a read-across with its audio control module team, which concluded that the problem only occurred on 2025 F-150 hybrid models and not others.\n\nFord reviewed this concern and its compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and also met with the NHTSA. The parties determined that the fault posed a safety risk and the automaker\u2019s Field Review Committee approved the voluntary recall on July 18.\n\nThe audio control module was sourced from Michigan-based Tier 1 supplier Visteon Corp. and an estimated 100% of the recalled hybrid pickups are believed to have the software defect. The dealer software update will ensure that the audible chimes play back in all starting conditions, according to the report.\n\nFord is not aware of any warranty claims or Vehicle Owner Questionnaires received by the NHTSA that\u2019s related to the condition. The automaker is also not aware of any accidents or injuries.\n\nFord\u2019s recall count in 2025 has now reached 94, which is the highest number for any automaker in a single year, according to NHTSA data. Since June 30, Ford issued nine separate recalls potentially extending to over 1.7 million vehicles.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStellantis appointed Scott Krugger to a newly created position as head of North America design, reporting directly to CEO Antonio Filosa, the automaker announced in a July 31 press release .\n\nKruger will be responsible for leading the creative direction of the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands in North America. His appointment comes a week after Stellantis named Gilles Vidal, former designer for Peugeot, as head of design for its European brands\n\n\u201cScott\u2019s appointment in North America and Gilles\u2019 arrival in Europe are key to our new design organization and to our plans to bring inspiring and exciting products to the North American and European markets, giving customers an even greater freedom of choice,\u201d said Stellantis chief design officer Ralph Gilles, in the release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMost recently, Krugger managed exterior design for Dodge and Dodge SRT performance vehicles in North America. Prior to that, he served for five years as head of Alfa Romeo, Jeep and user experience design at the company\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa design studio.\n\nThe two new appointments are part of the automaker\u2019s strategy to combine global expertise across its portfolio of 14 vehicle brands to ensure \u201ccontinued alignment with local customer needs,\u201d per the release.\n\nScott Krugger previously managed exterior design for Dodge and Dodge SRT performance vehicles in North America. Courtesy of Stellantis\n\nThe appointments are also important first steps for Gilles as he builds out the automaker\u2019s new global design organization. Gilles is leading the automaker\u2019s global design strategy, which includes collaboration with regional design heads on the strategic direction for each of its vehicle brands.\n\nGilles was named as chief design officer in June and he reports directly to Filosa.\n\n\u201cWith Scott\u2019s immense design talent and proven leadership in North America and Gilles\u2019 award-winning track record in Europe, we are opening a new chapter of creative excellence with the roll out of our organization,\u201d said Gilles in the release.\n\nStellantis also named Jason Stoicevich last month to lead dealer strategy and performance in North America as part of a broader initiative led by Filosa to assemble a new executive team to help lead Stellantis\u2019 turnaround.\n\nFilosa took over as CEO on June 23 and immediately surrounded himself with 16 new executives that he said \u201cbring an entrepreneurial spirit and profound understanding of the company\u2019s brands.\u201d\n\nFilosa was announced as Stellantis\u2019 new CEO in May, following the resignation of former CEO Carlos Tavares in December amid declining sales and profits. But Stellantis has also struggled in the first half of 2025 as the company deals with new tariffs and other market uncertainties.\n\nIn its July earnings report, Stellantis reported its first half revenues fell 13% compared to the same period last year, resulting in an operating loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion). The company said the impact of tariffs this year is expected to be roughly 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion).\n\nHowever, the automaker's new CEO remains optimistic about its future now that its new executive team is in place and it works to launch new models in North America and Europe and return to profitability.\n\nFilosa in June said the automaker\u2019s new executive team are \u201cleaders from within who bring a people-first mindset, a profound understanding of our brands, our products and our customers, best-in-class expertise and an entrepreneurial spirit that will be vital to our success.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Stellantis reshuffles executive team amidst H1 revenue drops and turnaround efforts.\n\n**Key details:**\nStellantis appointed Scott Krugger as head of North America design, reporting to CEO Antonio Filosa, effective July 31. This follows the prior appointment of Gilles Vidal as head of design for European brands. These appointments are part of Stellantis' new design organization, aiming to bring inspiring products to both North American and European markets. Additionally, Jason Stoicevich was named last month to lead dealer strategy and performance in North America. These moves are initial steps for Ralph Gilles as he builds out the automaker's new global design organization.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese executive appointments are crucial steps in a broader initiative led by new CEO Antonio Filosa to assemble a new executive team. This team is intended to help lead Stellantis' turnaround efforts amidst prior declining sales and profits. Filosa expresses optimism that this new team, combined with launching new models, will enable the company to return to profitability. This strategy suggests a potential shift from the company's recent struggles, challenging a view of continued poor performance. The new appointments aim to combine global expertise and align with local customer needs to drive future success.\n\n**The big picture:**\nStellantis' new CEO, Antonio Filosa, took over on June 23 after former CEO Carlos Tavares resigned in December due to declining sales and profits. Filosa immediately appointed 16 new executives, including these design leadership roles, as part of a turnaround strategy. The company has struggled in the first half of 2025, experiencing an operating loss due to new tariffs and market uncertainties. These executive changes, especially in design, are part of a strategy to combine global expertise across its 14 brands. The goal is to ensure alignment with local customer needs and launch new models in North America and Europe.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **13%:** First half revenues fell compared to the same period last year.\n*   **2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion):** Operating loss reported in the first half.\n*   **1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion):** Expected impact of tariffs this year.\n*   **16:** New executives Antonio Filosa immediately surrounded himself with.\n*   **June 23:** Date Antonio Filosa took over as CEO.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Stellantis:** Automaker making executive appointments as part of a strategy to improve financial performance.\n*   **Scott Krugger:** Appointed head of North America design, leading creative direction for major brands.\n*   **Antonio Filosa:** New CEO, assembling a new executive team to lead the company's turnaround.\n*   **Gilles Vidal:** Named head of design for Stellantis' European brands a week before Krugger.\n*   **Ralph Gilles:** Chief design officer, building the automaker's new global design organization.\n*   **Jason Stoicevich:** Appointed to lead dealer strategy and performance in North America.\n*   **Carlos Tavares:** Former CEO, resigned in December amidst declining sales and profits.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew CEO reshapes Stellantis leadership to reverse financial declines and launch new models.",

They pointed to a lack of fulfillment or advancement in their career, not feeling adequately compensated, mental health issues tied to being a supervisor, a desire for more time off, a desire for more flexible hours or a desire to leave a people management role.\n\n\u201cSupervisors are saying, \u2018No more.\u2019 Future leaders are saying, \u2018No, thanks,\u2019\u201d Bob Funk, Jr., CEO, president and chairman of Express Employment International, said in a news release. \u201cThe result? A vicious cycle that decreases effectiveness, breeds toxicity and weakens the workplace. The companies that come to terms with the situation and start implementing solutions will be the ones that succeed in this reshaped economy.\u201d\n\nIn surveys of more than 1,000 U.S. adults and 1,000 U.S. hiring decision-makers, 86% of hiring managers said they believe supervisors have the tools they need. However, only a third said they offer training on critical skills such as conflict resolution or employee feedback. In addition, 72% said their companies should do more to better support supervisors.\n\nBeyond that, nearly 3 in 4 Generation Z workers said they would prefer to develop individual expertise rather than manage people. Without a pipeline of future supervisors, companies may experience a leadership vacuum in coming years, the report found.\n\nNotably, neglecting supervisor development can lead to several consequences, such as disengagement, lost revenue, weak culture, burnout and turnover. Instead, companies can reverse the trend by building leadership training programs, developing peer and mentor networks, investing in mental health initiatives and promoting work-life balance, the report found.\n\nAs supervisors struggle, C-suite executives are also experiencing a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d as they face higher levels of stress, burnout and turnover, according to an LHH report. Senior leaders said they feel unprepared for today\u2019s business environment and need more support.",

They cite reasons including lack of fulfillment, inadequate compensation, mental health issues, and a desire for more flexibility or to exit people management roles. This trend is leading to a shortage of new leaders, with nearly 3 in 4 Generation Z workers preferring individual expertise over management. Hiring managers acknowledge the issue, with 72% stating companies should better support supervisors, yet only a third offer critical skills training.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information suggests a looming leadership vacuum, potentially challenging the assumption that companies have robust internal leadership pipelines. Neglecting supervisor development can lead to disengagement, lost revenue, weak company culture, and high turnover, all of which directly impact a company's financial performance and stability. For investors, this signals potential future operational inefficiencies and reduced profitability in companies failing to address this leadership crisis. The current consensus on leadership readiness may be overly optimistic, given these widespread supervisory challenges.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe current situation describes a \"vicious cycle\" where supervisory departures and a lack of new candidates decrease workplace effectiveness and breed toxicity. This trend is occurring in a \"reshaped economy\" where companies must adapt. The report indicates that only those companies that \"come to terms with the situation and start implementing solutions\" will succeed.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon Autos, the online car buying marketplace of e-commerce giant Amazon, is adding used and certified pre-owned (CPO) Hyundai Motor America vehicles to its platform, the company announced on Monday.\n\nCustomers will have the option to filter results on Amazon Autos to show either new or used Hyundai vehicles. But all vehicles offered for sale shown will be limited to a 75-mile radius of their location.\n\nIn addition, all used vehicles sold via Amazon Autos will come with a three-day, 300-mile return policy and a minimum 30-day, 1,000-mile limited warranty. The first online sales of used Hyundai models will be in the Los Angles area, with plans to expand to other U.S. cities in the coming months.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon launched the Amazon Autos online marketplace last December in partnership with Hyundai, which allows customers to purchase a new vehicle online and arrange for pickup at a local dealer of their choice. But the online store previously did not offer used vehicles.\n\nThe addition of used and CPO vehicles to the Amazon Autos marketplace also allows dealers to sell their non-Hyundai inventory to expand customer buying choices, including vehicles from Ford, Toyota, Nissan, BMW and other brands.\n\n\u201cWe think of Amazon Autos as a marketplace where dealers can reach more customers,\u201d said Fan Jin, director and GM of Amazon Autos, in an interview with Automotive Dive. \u201cWe have heard time and again from our customers that it [car buying] is a difficult, complex purchase for them.\u201d\n\nJin said that since the launch of the Amazon Autos marketplace last December, customers have asked for more choices, including purchasing vehicles online from other OEMs.\n\n\u201cThe number one ask from all customers is \u2018can we see more selection?\u2019\u201d said Jin. \u201cCan we see more other brands of cars, other vehicle conditions, new, used, certified, pre-owned cars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to offering more buying choices for Hyundai customers, many car shoppers today are seeking a digital car buying experience to avoid high-pressure sales tactics and pressure of buying a car from a dealer in-person. Amazon Autos says its marketplace offers car buyers a seamless e-commerce experience with transparent pricing and no hidden fees.\n\nThe online marketplace, for example, provides comprehensive information for each listing, including vehicle history reports. Amazon Autos also offers seamless integration with Hyundai dealerships so that customers can more easily arrange for in-person test drives to help address some of the reservations they may have of purchasing a used vehicle online.\n\nAmazon Autos is offering what it calls \u201cacceptance test drives,\u201d allowing prospective buyers to test drive a vehicle before they sign the final purchase paperwork at a Hyundai dealer.\n\n\u201cWe have the best of both worlds,\u201d said Jin. \u201cWe're providing dealers with millions of shoppers, local customers, who will see their [Amazon Autos] store, and we're giving those customers really transparent access and ease of access to what's available.\u201d\n\nAmazon Autos also vets Hyundai dealers to ensure customers don't have a bad car buying experience.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work as we onboard each dealer to configure them for e-commerce,\u201d Jin said.\n\nIn addition, Hyundai dealers are also required to adhere to Amazon Autos\u2019 own requirements for selling vehicles online in order to ensure customer satisfaction and a smooth buying experience. Shoppers can also read reviews of dealers before deciding on a pickup location.\n\n\u201cWe look for dealers with high reputation scores, and we hold them to very high standards in how they sell, how they treat their customers,\u201d said Jin. \u201cWe want to give customers peace of mind when they're buying a used car through Amazon that they'll be taken care of.\u201d\n\nJin did not disclose how many Hyundai vehicles were sold via Amazon Autos since its launch in January, but confirmed that the marketplace for new vehicles is now available in 130 U.S. cities, including New York, Boston, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco and other major metropolitan areas. Jin did say, however, that the Amazon Autos car buying experience has received high marks from customers.\n\n\u201cThe customer feedback has been off the charts good,\u201d said Jin. \u201cCustomers who transact, who buy their car through Amazon, give customer satisfaction scores, [Net Promoter Scores] that are many times over what the industry average is.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Cox Automotive forecast released in February, a seamless, omnichannel car buying experience combining online and at-dealership activities is essential for succeeding in today\u2019s automotive retail market. Cox Automotive also reported earlier this year that car buying satisfaction reached a record high in 2024, driven by more transparent vehicle pricing, as well as the availability of improved digital tools for consumers, which Amazon Autos is providing.\n\n\"We're excited to be an early participant in Amazon Autos' expansion,\" said Weslie Metcalf, managing partner of Premier Hyundai in Moreno Valley, California, in the release. \u201cWe believe this collaboration has the potential to help us reach more customers and enhance our online sales process.\u201d\n\nJin added that many U.S. Hyundai dealers have expressed strong interest in being added to the platform, so much so that Amazon Autos has had its own challenges in onboarding new dealer sales partners. But according to Jin, the company is working to address it.\n\n\u201cThe second positive for us here is that we have a lot of dealer interest, and really our bottleneck is internal, where we have a bottleneck of onboarding dealers,\u201d said Jin. \u201cSo we're very bullish on the program.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "The American manufacturing industry has gone through several distinct eras, and now knocks at the door of yet another. First there was a boom of domestic manufacturing, where most products used by Americans were made in America. This was followed by a long transition into an offshored global supply chain, where more and more component parts and complete goods were imported from other countries, taking advantage of lower labor costs. And now, as widespread new tariffs lower the profitability of importing, we enter into a third era.\n\nIt\u2019d be too simple to say this is just a return to the first era, that the result will be total re-shoring of production to America. Even with additional costs, sometimes foreign production will still be cheaper or otherwise necessary. Likewise, it\u2019s actually too simple to say this is entirely because of tariffs. Tariffs are just the latest and most relevant in a long line of disruptions to the global supply chain: COVID, material shortages, shipping issues, geopolitical conflicts, and more.\n\nInstead, this era will be defined by not having any singular strategy that defines it. There will be re-shoring and offshoring. There will be more selling to domestic audiences, but new global markets will open up. Technological innovation will continue to grow at a breakneck pace, with categories of products that we can\u2019t yet imagine becoming pillars of the economy: robotics, 3D-printed consumer goods, maybe even flying cars! There will be crises demanding rapid readjustment, but in each crisis, the opportunity to do something that\u2019s never been done before.\n\nSo what do you do? The first step is not seeing this complex, turbulent era as a negative, as just a storm to be weathered. That \u201clet\u2019s batten down the hatches and try to ride this out\u201d attitude is going to leave you out-competed and without a seat at the table. Instead, see this as the adjustment period to a new world of manufacturing, a new world that actually represents the global demand for manufactured products. We talk about unleashing the potential of manufacturing because we feel we\u2019re still just scratching the surface of the manufactured world. All of these disruptions and flux points are your opportunity to seize a slice of that new, massive, pie.\n\nOkay, so how do you do that? It comes down to three main pillars: being knowledgeable, being agile, and being flexible. You need to be knowledgeable enough to keep up with the risks and opportunities hidden in the news every day. The more sources of information you can absorb and understand in the context of your business, the more you can hone in on the right gameplan. You should be able to access your own systems\u2019 data and consistently simulate any potential cost change, delay, or other disruption.\n\nNext is agility. Once you\u2019ve seen the effects that disruptions could have, you need to be able to switch to an alternative, fast. You won\u2019t ever be the only one trying to sell to a new market, or introduce a new technology, or switch away from a costly supplier. But you can be the one who does it first. The first mover advantage in these situations is huge.\n\nFinally is flexibility. When you\u2019ve chosen to adopt a new strategy, or when disruptions force a new strategy on you, you don\u2019t want it to come at a major cost. You don\u2019t want to be stuck with a warehouse full of products you\u2019ve realized aren\u2019t profitable to sell. Some loss is inevitable, but focusing on maintaining a week-by-week, or even day-to-day gameplan instead of committing for months or years will help you from getting stuck on the wrong path.\n\nThis all sounds great, but is this advice sufficient? After all, the speed of a manufacturing shop is the speed of your production line, which is highly optimized, right? The flexibility of a manufacturing shop is dictated by economies of scale, by minimum order sizes and production runs, right? And knowledge? Yeah, you can spend all day digging through spreadsheets and purchase orders and filing cabinets, but is that really a better use of your time than just doing something?\n\nThe answer is to not optimize production itself, but back office processes. And that\u2019s where CADDi comes in. Our platform revolutionizes how you access and use manufacturing data, making you perfectly knowledgeable about all your options, up to 80% faster in your workflows, and dynamic enough to not overcommit.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Manufacturing Contracts in July Amid Tariff Woes; Outlook Mixed\n\n**Key details:**\nThe manufacturing industry's contraction accelerated in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) registering 48%. Production rose to 51.4%, but this suggests higher prices due to ongoing tariff concerns. Supplier deliveries were faster in July, and the employment index fell, indicating cautious hiring despite increased production. However, new and backlog orders increased by 47.1% and 46.8% respectively, offering potential positive indications for the future. S&P's July PMI also showed a deterioration in operating conditions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe accelerating manufacturing contraction signals a challenging environment, reinforced by a significant GDP contraction to 79% in July, which is \"quite concerning.\" Tariffs are prompting companies to question sourcing strategies and consider passing higher costs to customers, indicating a broader impact on pricing and supply chains. This situation presents a mixed picture that challenges a purely negative industry consensus, as the increase in new and backlog orders suggests a future rebuild of inventories. Furthermore, U.S. manufacturers now anticipate greater stability from understood tariff conditions, which is considered a \"good thing.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe manufacturing sector is currently navigating persistent tariff concerns, which are causing companies to evaluate sourcing and potential cost increases for consumers. Industry health is measured by PMI, with readings below 50% indicating contraction. Companies previously saw customers stocking up on orders to get ahead of tariffs, leading to a rise in new and backlog orders. This suggests that once inventories are depleted, companies may return to their suppliers to restock. Manufacturers also believe that trade deals made by the Trump administration will contribute to more stable and predictable future conditions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM\u2019s July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index: 48%, down one percentage point from June.\n*   Manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted to 79% in July, from 46% in June.\n*   New orders increased by 47.1% and backlog orders by 46.8%.\n*   Employment index registered 43.4%, down 1.6 percentage points from June\u2019s 45%.\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI reported 49.8%, down from June\u2019s 52.9%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Reported the July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, indicating manufacturing industry contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, discussed tariff impacts on sourcing, costs, and future positive indicators.\n*   **S&P:** Published its July PMI report, reflecting similar numbers and deteriorating operating conditions.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist, commented on declining optimism and employment.\n*   **Trump administration:** Its trade deals are expected to create more stable and predictable conditions for manufacturers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing contracts amid tariffs, with mixed signals for future demand.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nConfidence among voters in the fiscal health of the U.S. fell in July to the lowest level in 13 months after passage of the Trump administration\u2019s massive tax-and-spending bill, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation said.\n\nNearly six out of 10 voters (59%) believe the U.S. is on a risky fiscal path, and 61% expect the nation\u2019s debt burden to grow heavier during the next few years, the Peterson Foundation said, citing a survey. The recently enacted legislation will push up the national debt by $4.1 trillion by the end of 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\u201cVoters are making clear that it\u2019s time to stop digging the hole deeper, and want their leaders to take action to stabilize the debt and create a sustainable budget outlook,\u201d Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson said in a statement. \u201cAmerica currently spends more on interest on the debt than on national defense or Medicaid, and interest costs are also growing faster than both.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe survey suggests that the Trump administration has not persuaded most voters that the recently enacted legislation \u2014 focusing on cutting taxes and scaling back healthcare and social welfare programs \u2014 improves the nation\u2019s long-term budgetary outlook.\n\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has repeatedly said that CBO and other estimates are flawed and that the legislation will trim the federal deficit by $1.4 trillion by 2034.\n\n\u201cIf you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture,\u201d Vought said on X in June, referring to the reconciliation bill.\n\nBefore the July enactment of the legislation, the Government Accountability Office calculated that the public debt will rise from 98% of GDP in September to a record 106% of GDP by 2027.\n\nThe Trump administration, citing its fiscal program, paints a more optimistic picture.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pro-growth economic policies and reining in wasteful spending are key to improving the fiscal outlook,\u201d the White House said in June. Trump\u2019s \u201cproven economic formula \u2014 historic tax relief, rapid deregulation, balanced trade and reining in wasteful spending \u2014 will slash our debt down to just 94% of GDP\u201d by 2034.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans, including those in the White House, acknowledge the urgency of putting the U.S. on a sustainable budgetary path.\n\nBefore passage of the Trump-backed legislation, EY and Peterson estimated that by 2035 the rising national debt would undermine the size of the economy by $340 billion, cut the number of U.S. jobs by 1.2 million and set back private investment by 13.6%.\n\nAlso, U.S. CEOs identified the nation\u2019s debt as \u201ca ticking time bomb\u201d before President Donald Trump took office in January, the Conference Board said.\n\nMore than half of CEOs (51%) considered the national debt and deficits as the No. 1 external risk for their businesses, the Conference Board said in January, citing a survey.\n\nWith rising federal debt, the increase in federal government borrowing pushes up the cost of capital and \u201ccrowds out\u201d private sector borrowing, inhibiting innovation and business investment, according to economists.\n\nThe murky fiscal outlook, affirmed by downgrades by all three major credit ratings firms, complicates corporate planning, prompting delays in hiring and investment.\n\nReducing the federal debt should be among the top three priorities for Trump and Congress, according to 80% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation, including 83% of Republicans. In June, 76% of voters held that view.\n\nThe Peterson Foundation commissioned the poll of 1,003 registered voters nationwide between July 21 and July 23.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nTesla, its CEO Elon Musk, CFO Vaibhav Taneja, and former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn concealed \u201csignificant risk\u201d related to the electric vehicle maker\u2019s autonomous driving technology, making materially false and misleading statements about the technology\u2019s safety and potential, according to a federal securities class action complaint filed Monday in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.\n\nThe complaint, which names the three current and former company executives as defendants, was filed by Denise Morand on behalf of company stockholders which purchased shares between April 19, 2023 and June 22, 2025. It alleges the named defendants committed securities fraud by failing to disclose the risks associated with the EV maker\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology, including robotaxis, and that, \u201caccordingly, Tesla\u2019s business and/or financial prospects were overstated,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cAs a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\u201d\n\nBy failing to disclose such risks, the three defendants participated in a scheme to \u201cdeceive the investing public\u201d and \u201cartificially inflate and maintain the market price of Tesla securities. Specifically, the complaint alleges \u201cdefendants Kirkhorn and Taneja enriched themselves by engaging in insider sales of the shares while those shares traded at artificially high prices.\u201d During the period in question, Kirkhorn sold approximately 7,403 shares of Tesla stock with a value of at least $1.59 million, while Taneja sold about 8,192 shares of Tesla stock for at least $2.51 million, according to the complaint.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBoth Kirkhorn and Taneja have reaped multi-million dollar pay packages during their respective tenures as finance chief for the Austin, Texas-based EV maker. Kirkhorn departed from the EV maker in 2023 with a $590 million pay package, after a 13-year tenure with Tesla that included four years in its top financial seat, CFO Dive reported at the time.\n\nTaneja, meanwhile, who succeeded Kirkhorn as CFO in 2023, has made repeated sales of company stock over the past year, most recently offloading approximately $1.7 million in shares across transactions on July 7 and 8 after selling more than $3 million in shares in June, CFO Dive reported. This came after Taneja\u2019s compensation for full-year 2024 reached $139 million, largely comprised of stock and equity awards.\n\nThe complaint comes as the EV maker\u2019s efforts to move forward with autonomous driving technology have hit repeated setbacks. On Aug. 1, the EV maker was ordered to pay more than $240 million to the victims of a 2019 crash related to its autopilot technology by a Florida jury, according to a report by The Guardian. The company also remains embroiled in a regulatory tug-of-war with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which has claimed the EV maker exaggerated the capabilities of its self-driving technology, according to a July 21 report by Bloomberg.\n\nMusk has repeatedly championed the potential of Tesla\u2019s robotaxi and similar technologies, a long-time passion project for the EV maker\u2019s CEO. During the company\u2019s most recent earnings call \u2014 where Tesla saw a 12% dip in revenue year-over-year, as well as 42% YoY dip in operating income \u2014 Musk was optimistic about Tesla\u2019s robotaxi prospects, despite warning there might be some \u201crough quarters\u201d ahead for the business, CFO Dive previously reported.The company\u2019s robotaxi pilot, launched in Austin, Texas in June, is a \u201cseminal point\u201d for the business, he said, while also stressing the company is \u201cbeing paranoid about safety.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s shareholder complaint alleges Musk and his fellow defendants made repeated false or repeated statements regarding the safety of its autonomous driving services, and pointed to a June Bloomberg article, published shortly after the launch of the robotaxi pilot, which appears to show robotaxis disobeying traffic laws. The defendants also failed to disclose risks that such vehicles would \u201coperate dangerously and/or in violation of traffic laws,\u201d as well as the corresponding likelihood that Telsa would become \u201csubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never actually investors. It\u2019s always shitty class-action lawyers grifting for their percentage of the verdict,\u201d Musk said in a Tuesday post on the social media site X, which he owns, in a reply regarding the suit. \u201cThey are scum of the Earth. The worst human being I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d\n\nThe suit comes as Tesla\u2019s board also voted to grant Musk a pay package with a value of approximately $29 billion, following a seven-year ongoing regulatory tussle with Delaware legislators.\n\n\u201cTo recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018,\u201d the company said in a Monday post on X. The board \u201crecommended this award as a first step, \u2018good faith\u2019 payment to Elon,\u201d according to the post.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment. Willie C.

The ISM\u2019s index of services declined to 50.1 from 50.8 in June. A reading below 50 signals contraction.\n\n\u201cThe most common topic among survey panelists remained tariff-related impacts, with a noticeable increase in commodities listed as up in price,\u201d Steve Miller, chair of the ISM services business survey committee, said in a statement.

Unemployment increased 0.1 percentage point to 4.2%.\n\nAfter release of the less-than-forecast employment numbers, President Donald Trump fired the BLS commissioner, alleging that the bureau \u201crigged\u201d the data.\n\nJob seekers face a bigger challenge finding employment, and a growing share of workers are involuntarily on the job part time rather than full time, the Conference Board said Monday. The organization\u2019s Employment Trends Index declined from 108.19 in June to 107.55 in July, the lowest level since October.\n\nAlong with the cooling labor market, inflation exceeding the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-run goal is also discouraging consumers from spending.\n\nPrice pressures will likely rise as tariffs bite in coming months, according to both public- and private-sector economists.\n\nConsumers already face an average tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab said Friday.\n\nHigher import duties set by Trump this year will likely push up short-term prices by 1.8% in the short-run, imposing a $2,400 income loss for the average household, the Yale Budget Lab said.\n\n\u201cConsumers are a bit more careful,\u201d Procter & Gamble CFO Andre Schulten said during an earnings call with analysts on July 29. \u201cWe see consumption trends consistently decelerating, not significantly, but we see a deceleration in the U.S.\u201d\n\nService sector companies also face mounting price pressures, the ISM said, noting that its prices paid index rose from 67.5 in June to 69.9 in July, the highest level since October 2022.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** U.S. Service Sector Growth Stalls Amid Rising Tariffs and Job Losses\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. service sector's growth slowed significantly in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index dropping to 50.1 from 50.8. This slowdown is accompanied by a noticeable increase in prices driven by tariff-related impacts. Employment in the service sector fell for the fourth time in five months, signaling continued contraction. Overall consumer spending growth slumped to just 1.4% during the second quarter, half the pace of 2024. July saw less-than-forecast job additions of 73,000, with prior months' growth revised down by 258,000.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe clear deterioration in the labor market, combined with the drag on real incomes from tariffs, suggests a marked recovery in spending is unlikely. This challenges any consensus view expecting a quick rebound, as price pressures are expected to rise further. Consumers are already facing the highest average tariff rate since 1934, which the Yale Budget Lab estimates could impose a $2,400 income loss per household. Procter & Gamble's CFO notes consistently decelerating consumption trends in the U.S., indicating broader economic caution.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe U.S. economy is contending with widespread tariff impacts, pushing up prices for both commodities and consumers. This occurs as the job market cools, with companies slowing hiring amid an uncertain trade outlook. Consumer spending on goods and services has been consistently decelerating throughout the year. These factors contribute to an environment where inflation is exceeding the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-run goal.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM services index: 50.1 in July, down from 50.8 in June.\n*   Consumer spending growth: 1.4% in Q2, half the pace during the same period in 2024.\n*   July job additions: 73,000, less-than-forecast.\n*   Average tariff rate: 18.3%, the highest since 1934.\n*   ISM prices paid index: 69.9 in July, highest level since October 2022.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Reported the slowdown in the U.S. service sector and rising prices in July.\n*   **Steve Miller:** Chair of the ISM services business survey committee, highlighted tariff impacts and worrisome developments.\n*   **Commerce Department:** Reported the decelerated consumer spending growth figures for the second quarter.\n*   **Oliver Allen:** Senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, assessed the labor market and spending outlook.\n*   **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):** Reported cooling job market data, including July job additions and unemployment rate.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Fired the BLS commissioner, alleging the bureau \"rigged\" the employment data.\n*   **The Conference Board:** Reported a decline in its Employment Trends Index, signaling increased challenges for job seekers.\n*   **Yale Budget Lab:** Quantified the average tariff rate and estimated potential income loss for average households.\n*   **Procter & Gamble:** Consumer goods company whose CFO observed decelerating consumption trends in the U.S.\n*   **Andre Schulten:** CFO of Procter & Gamble, confirmed decelerating consumer consumption trends during an earnings call.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTariffs, slowing jobs, and weaker spending are significantly pressuring U.S. economic growth.",

        "summary_text": "SEON CFO Angela Pierce is keeping a close watch on how volatility in the global economy could potentially impact the fraud prevention software provider\u2019s business.\n\nWhile tariffs may not have a direct impact on the Austin, Texas-based company \u2014 which provides fraud prevention and anti-money laundering compliance solutions to businesses \u2014 currency and foreign exchange risk remain top of mind, and is \u201ca common topic at my CFO round tables,\u201d Pierce said in an interview. The company announced Pierce\u2019s appointment as CFO in a July 23 press release.\n\nLike many other global entities, SEON is seeing the wobbling of the U.S. dollar affect their financials. The dollar had its worst start to the year since 1973, weakening by more than 10% over the past six months compared with currencies from major trading partners, The New York Times reported in June. FX uncertainty is influencing decisions such as hiring and vendor contracts; certain vendors, for example, may ask to be paid in one currency over another, and \u201cit makes a difference on where we hire people,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nRevenue commitment\n\nPierce is keeping a close watch on such risk as SEON seeks to further expand its global footprint, with the software company citing her experience in driving scale at high-growth companies as \u201cinstrumental\u201d to its next phase of growth, according to the press release announcing her appointment.\n\nPrior to her appointment at SEON, Pierce most recently served as finance chief for children\u2019s book club provider Literati, according to the press release. Her previous roles also include a four-year tenure as CFO for software development platform Anaconda, where she helped to secure over $250 million in capital, according to the release.\n\nAngela Pierce Permission granted by SEON\n\nAs the business charts a path to expansion in a volatile macroeconomic environment, Pierce is taking a measured approach to ensuring SEON is well-supported to meet its goals. Like most CFOs, Pierce is very \u201cmetrics-driven\u201d when it comes to weighing where and in which projects or initiatives to invest, she said.\n\nFor example, SEON is looking to expand to new markets where the fraud prevention provider has customers, but not a strong presence, and \u201cwe're having to make real-time decisions about that, and it's very much an ROI trade off,\u201d she said, one which, for Pierce, begins with revenue: \u201cif there's no revenue commitment. I don't want to talk about it,\u201d she said.\n\nThough it\u2019s still early days at SEON, Pierce also takes a similar approach when examining cash and capital needs.\n\n\u201cI always have at least 12 to 18 months of cash on the balance sheet. If I don't, I start putting the hammer down,\u201d she said, speaking of her strategy generally. In terms of capital, it\u2019s crucial for CFOs to have a transparent understanding of where the business wants to go, especially as it charts a path to profitability, Pierce said.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, there's always sort of this litmus point where it's like, hey, we have a goal to get to a certain valuation and a certain break-even in three years, and if I back up from there, what kind of capital can the business support?\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThen you're allowed to say, Okay, well, if that's the capital we can support over the next kind of 36 months, then can we make big bets, or can we not?\u201d\n\nSEON raised $94 million in a Series B funding round, led by IVP in 2022, according to a press release at the time. The round, which followed a $12 million Series A, gave the company a valuation of $500 million, CNBC reported at the time, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe lure of a fragmented market\n\nWhile Pierce is carefully looking to balance the company\u2019s future goals against current macroeconomic pressures, she\u2019s optimistic about SEON\u2019s potential for growth. She was drawn to the CFO role at the company in part because of the evolving market where the company sits; if there\u2019s \u201ca lot of little ankle biters in a highly fragmented market, I think that's always really attractive,\u201d she said of what helped to entice her to SEON\u2019s top financial seat.\n\nA fragmented market serves as a \u201cleading indicator\u201d of high investor interest and that there is a good amount of capital flowing to the space, opening up opportunities for a \u201ccompany that\u2019s a little stronger to come in and start aligning the market,\u201d Pierce said.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of really unique, evolving problems to be solved, because you're not fragmented unless there's a lot of young companies or point solutions solving unique problems,\u201d she said.\n\nIn order to establish a lasting place in such a field, however, companies need to find the right \u201cinflection point,\u201d which means they also have to be sure they are expanding their own internal capabilities and tools.\n\nAs SEON continues to grow, \u201cthe operational and financial infrastructure has a lot of opportunities to grow\u201d as well, Pierce said. \u201cWe're probably two or three years behind where I'd like us to be on kind of operational muscle and so I think that's a big opportunity for us.\u201d",

Ramp recently raised $500 million at a $22.5 billion valuation in a Series E-2 funding round, following the launch of its first AI agents. These agents, unveiled June 10, target controllers to enforce expense policies and prevent fraud, with more planned this year. Glyman states this shift is about redeploying human talent into higher-value work, not replacing them.\n\n**Why it matters:** This news indicates a rapid, near-term paradigm shift in corporate finance operations, challenging the traditional view of finance team structures. The predicted rise of autonomous AI agents means junior analysts will become \"agent coaches,\" and senior leaders will focus on a \"smaller number of higher quality decisions.\" Ramp's significant funding and product launch highlight a move towards AI automating core finance tasks, potentially disrupting how businesses manage spending and operations much sooner than anticipated. Gartner's forecast of 33% enterprise software including agentic AI by 2028 underscores this accelerated transformation.\n\n**The big picture:** The broader context shows more CFOs are actively testing AI tools, marking a \"unique moment in finance.\" Agentic AI specifically is seen as heralding a future where finance software can \"think, acts, and improves by itself.\" Ramp joins a growing list of enterprise software companies offering AI agents for workplace tasks with minimal human intervention.

The administration\u2019s pullback in hiring has also reduced the number of federal jobs.\n\nFor several months this year, the supply of workers has edged down along with demand, bringing the labor market into better balance, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday before release of the July employment data.\n\n\u201cBy many, many statistics, the labor market is kind of still in balance,\u201d he said after the Fed flagged \u201celevated\u201d inflation and decided for the fifth straight policy meeting to hold the main interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%.\n\n\u201cThings like quits, job openings and let alone the unemployment rate, they\u2019re all by many measures very similar to where they were a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you do not see weakening in the labor market.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the job market warrants close attention by the central bank, Powell said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s getting into balance due to declines in both supply and demand, though, is suggestive of downside risks,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo of course we\u2019ll be watching that carefully.\u201d\n\nSome economists say employment, inflation and other data point to coming weakness in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe economy is on the precipice of recession,\u201d Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark Zandi said, blaming restrictions on immigration and import duties, which he said are eroding corporate profits and undermining household purchasing power.\n\n\u201cUnemployment remains low, but that\u2019s only because labor force growth has gone sideways,\u201d Zandi said on X. \u201cConsumer spending has flat-lined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall,\u201d he said Sunday on X.\n\n\u201cWith inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,\u201d Zandi said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** U.S. Labor Market Cools, Raising Recession Concerns\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. labor market is losing steam, with the Conference Board\u2019s Employment Trends Index declining to its lowest level since October. Job seekers are finding opportunities more elusive, and more workers are involuntarily employed part-time. Employers added a less-than-forecast 73,000 workers in July, and past job growth for June and May was cut by 258,000. Unemployment increased to 4.2%, and the number of long-term unemployed exceeded 1.8 million, highest since 2017 (excluding the pandemic). The share of small companies struggling to fill jobs also fell.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information suggests a significant cooling in the U.S. labor market, fueled by companies' hesitation amid tariff and policy uncertainty. It challenges recent statements by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who had maintained the labor market was \"kind of still in balance\" and showed no weakening. While Powell noted the market getting into balance due to declines in supply and demand, he highlighted this is \"suggestive of downside risks.\" Some economists now interpret these employment trends, alongside other data, as indicators of coming economic weakness and even recession.\n\n**The big picture:** The Conference Board's index decline aligns with recent Labor Department data confirming a cooling labor market over the past three months. This softening follows the Trump administration's \"back-and-forth approach to tariff negotiations,\" which has led companies to forgo hiring and investment. The Federal Reserve, closely monitoring the job market amid \"elevated\" inflation, has held its main interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5% for five straight policy meetings.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Conference Board Employment Trends Index: declined to 107.55 in July from 108.19 in June.\n*   Small companies reporting difficulty filling jobs: fell to 33% from 36%.\n*   Employers added: a less-than-forecast 73,000 workers in July.\n*   Prior job growth revisions: cut by a total of 258,000 for June and May.\n*   Unemployment rate: increased 0.1 percentage point to 4.2%.\n*   Long-term unemployed (27+ weeks): exceeded 1.8 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **The Conference Board:** Stated the U.S. labor market is losing steam and job opportunities are elusive.\n*   **Mitchell Barnes:** Conference Board Economist, noted companies grew hesitant amid tariff and policy uncertainty.\n*   **Labor Department:** Released data confirming the labor market cooled during the past three months.\n*   **Trump administration:** Its tariff approach prompted companies to forgo hiring and investment.\n*   **Federal Reserve (Fed):** Central bank held interest rates steady while flagging \"elevated\" inflation.\n*   **Jerome Powell:** Federal Reserve Chair, stated the labor market is in balance but noted \"downside risks.\"\n*   **Mark Zandi:** Moody\u2019s Chief Economist, stated the economy is \"on the precipice of recession.\"\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** U.S. labor market cools, raising recession fears, challenging balanced view.",

        "summary_text": "Today\u2019s finance chiefs are steadily assuming a rising host of responsibilities outside of finance \u2014 an evolution that is also shining a spotlight on the critical, interconnected role of the finance function. For newly-minted Finzly CFO Adam Carson, \u201cfinance is not a passive or backseat function at all,\u201d he told CFO Dive, but rather, \u201ca driving partnership with the business.\u201d\n\nThe first-ever finance chief for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, Carson\u2019s appointment earlier this month comes as Finzly seeks to further expand its operations and market reach, according to a July 17 press release announcing the move. Alongside Carson, Finzly also appointed Robert Coakley as head of partnerships, according to the release. The company provides payments infrastructure to financial institutions and supports payment rails including ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT and instant payments.\n\nIn his first few months as finance chief, Carson is focusing on ensuring the finance function is well-positioned to help Finzly\u2019s strategic goals of expansion. For any finance chief coming into a new situation \u2014 whether the company\u2019s first CFO or otherwise \u2014 the focus is on determining if the business is set up effectively for where it needs to go in the future, \u201cand you want to assess that around the people, the technology and the partnerships and processes that you have in place,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWhat you're looking for is ultimately, alignment on how you get from where you are today to where you think the business strategically needs to be in the future, and how does finance contribute to that growth rate?\u201d Carson said.\n\nA culture of connectivity\n\nA veteran of the software industry, Carson was attracted to the top financial seat at Finzly due to the combination of its previous success \u2014 the business\u2019 clients include financial entities such as Arvest, Banc of California, and EverBank \u2014 and its future growth potential. His background and the ambitions of Finzly\u2019s founder and CEO, Booshan Rengachari, also \u201clined up well in terms of where the company was going,\u201d he said of taking the seat.\n\nCarson\u2019s past roles in the software space include stints at Intuit, Barracuda Networks and Cyence, and he most recently served as CFO for private equity-backed software-as-a-service firm Movista, according to his LinkedIn profile. As VP, finance and investor relations for Barracuda, Carson helped to facilitate the cybersecurity provider\u2019s initial public offering in 2013, before the company was sold to Thoma Bravo for $1.6 billion in 2017, according to reports at the time from Reuters and Dark Reading.\n\nIn assuming the CFO seat for Finzly, Carson\u2019s priority is to help the business continue to \u201cevolve, grow and scale,\u201d he said, noting the company\u2019s processes and customer focus are \u201crock solid.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, \u201ca few things I want to enhance\u201d surrounding the company\u2019s ability to deliver insights at speed and scale, Carson said. That means taking a close look at how the company\u2019s teams communicate \u2014 and ensuring they have the details they need from finance to effectively achieve their goals.\n\nAs finance chief, \u201cI get to work with every single person in the company, directly or indirectly, because what they do, day in, day out, how they're delivering for our customers and the decisions that they're making, ultimately reflect on the financials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to create a culture where that cohesion and connectivity is really embedded in everything that we do, because that's already how people are operating, and I just want to help them with the financial information so that they can see it even more transparently,\u201d Carson said.\n\nPreparing for the long haul\n\nCarson is joining the bank payments infrastructure provider as it plans for further expansion \u2014 the business\u2019s strategic priorities remain largely on striving to become \u201cone of the critical platforms for banks going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong other recent steps, Finzly helped to aid its client banks with the shift to the new ISO 20022 standard \u2014 an international protocol for exchanging electronic messages between financial institutions \u2014 put in place by the Federal Reserve ahead of its July 14 deadline, according to a company press release.\n\nIn past years, the company has also reported rapid growth, noting a 400% surge in payment platform volume and a doubling of revenue from 2022 to 2023, according to a company release. In 2023, the company also raised $10 million in a Series A led by TZP Group, Banking Dive reported at the time.\n\nThe company\u2019s liquidity isn\u2019t necessarily something Carson is worried about at the moment, he said, noting funding and liquidity are always dependent on company strategy. Presently, the finance chief plans to ensure the company is continuing to successfully deliver its offerings to its customers, which means achieving the careful balance that is the constant challenge for those in the CFO role: setting up the company to meet long-term goals while, \u201cat the same exact time you're working to minimize execution risk on those things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you balance those two, what you have to do is, you have to become incredibly clear on, \u2018why are we doing something, what is in it for us over the long haul, and also, how are we going to be able to better serve our employees and our customers?\u2019\u201d Carson said.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMcLane\u2019s foodservice programs are well known across the c-store industry. The Temple, Texas-based company has been servicing the industry for decades, dating back to the 1960s, when it began tailoring its distribution business to c-stores.\n\nBut McLane has increased its investment in the industry over the past couple of years. In 2023, it debuted McLane Fresh, an expanded retail foodservice program created to meet consumers\u2019 growing expectations for healthy, quality food at convenience stores. The program\u2019s Central Eats line \u2014 which features pre-packaged grab-and-go cold items \u2014 was at the center of the launch.\n\nThat effort reached new levels last summer when McLane debuted its national commissary program for convenience retailers that use Central Eats. Operators in the program now have access to products like subs, sliders, salads and fruit cups through the commissary, as well as snack trays, veggie cups, oatmeal and parfaits.\n\nThe commissary program, which McLane does not have a single location for but is running through its 80-plus distribution centers, ensures all merchandise components \u2014 such as the bread, meat, cheese and sauce in a sandwich \u2014 are packaged and shipped together to avoid the headache of having to seek these items out separately, McLane Vice President of Retail Foodservice Jon Cox said in an interview.\n\nThe main goal of the program is to make life easier for convenience retailers, Cox said, many of whom struggle to find and retain the optimum number of store workers.\n\nAs the industry faces foodservice supply chain challenges with prices continuing to rise and tariffs looming, programs like McLane's could become a haven for c-store retailers looking to save on costs and labor.\n\n\u201cIf we could take the labor out of it for our customer, could it create a better value proposition for them to be able to sell the product?\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat's really how it kind of came to be.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nThe commissary program supports both large and small c-store operators with \u201cflexible piece-pick ordering,\u201d which reduces waste and enables customization by location, McLane said at the time of the launch. Once a retailer places their order, the commissary delivers to the closest McLane\u2019s distribution center, which then brings the order to the retailer.\n\nAll non Central Eats orders will be included in the same shipment to optimize efficiency, Cox said.\n\n\u201cThe McLane truck shows up, you get all of your other goods that you would normally get, and you get your commissary [orders] as well \u2014 so no more interruptions for the teammate,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox emphasized the commissary\u2019s ability to offer c-stores \u201ca fully finished product\u201d versus supplying multiple components or a retailer having to seek out extra parts for an item. Removing these extra steps for retailers to save time and stress around sourcing heavily played into McLane\u2019s decision to launch the program, he added.\n\n\u201cIf we could take the labor out of it for our customer, could it create a better value proposition for them to be able to sell the product?\u201d Jon Cox VP of retail foodservice, McLane\n\n\u201cThink about the complexity of having to go out and source meat and cheese and bread and packaging for containers and having to worry about [getting] all of those into place,\u201d he said.\n\nCox said that since many of McLane\u2019s team members have worked in the c-store industry \u2014 he was a senior director and VP at GetGo Caf\u00e9 + Markets for nearly a decade \u2014 they can \u201cfeel the pain of the labor constraint\u201d of the day-to-day c-store operations.\n\n\u201cI think being able to relate to what our customers are going through enables us to be able to create programs for them,\u201d he said.\n\nMcLane\u2019s entire food business, now including the commissary, aims to maximize retailers\u2019 sales and profits while acting as a plug-and-play tool for the operations, Cox said. That means giving them the best chance of success without the need for a chef or a large team.\n\n\u201cWe understand that our retailers are looking for that high-impact, low-labor solution, and I think we've been able to unlock that for them.\u201d",

Operating through McLane's 80-plus distribution centers, it aims to deliver a \"fully finished product\" to retailers.\n\n**Why it matters:** This program offers a potential \"haven\" for c-store retailers grappling with rising foodservice supply chain costs and looming tariffs. By taking labor out of the equation and providing pre-assembled products, McLane aims to create a better value proposition for retailers. This could challenge the prevailing industry consensus that c-stores must independently manage complex sourcing and labor, offering a simplified, \"low-labor solution\" alternative.\n\n**The big picture:** McLane has served the c-store industry for decades, tailoring its distribution business since the 1960s. The company has increased its investment in recent years, notably launching McLane Fresh and its Central Eats line in 2023. These prior efforts aimed to meet growing consumer demand for quality, healthy food at convenience stores.

In July alone, employers cut their workforce by more than 62,000, a 29% jump from June, the report said. Year over year, the cuts have risen 140%.\n\nThe report furthers a trend from previous months this year. U.S. retailers shed nearly 76,000 jobs in the first five months of this year, a 274% jump from a year earlier, according to a previous Challenger, Gray & Christmas report released in June.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs the retail job market contracts, the analysis found companies in the sector also have not released hiring plans this year to date \u2014 a noteworthy development given that the holiday season is around the corner. Tariffs, inflation and economic uncertainty have prompted retailers to close stores and lay off employees, the report said.\n\nMany of those same challenges are impacting industries more broadly as well.\n\n\u201cClosings of stores, units, or plants have led to 120,226 layoffs so far this year, while restructuring efforts have resulted in 66,879 job cuts. Bankruptcies accounted for another 35,641 layoffs,\u201d according to the report.\n\nIndeed, multiple major retailers have shuttered locations amid broader corporate restructurings. Between 2024 and February 2025, retailers closed more than 9,900 stores, but they only opened 7,700 locations during that period, a JLL analysis found.\n\nWhile some retailers have issued pink slips to a fraction of their staff, others are shutting down most or all of their storefronts.\n\nForever 21 shuttered its corporate headquarters and laid off 700 people in Pennsylvania and California in March. The following month, Catalyst Brands, which operates J.C. Penney, slashed 9% of its corporate positions. In June, Hasbro and Lululemon each let go of about 150 corporate staffers.\n\nAfter filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Party City announced it would liquidate its entire store footprint late last year. Similarly, Joann announced in February that it would shutter all of its locations, kicking off going-out-of-business sales across its store footprint.\n\nAs some retailers reduce their staff headcount or close their doors permanently, others are hiring ahead of the holiday season.

The analysis noted that retail companies have not released hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season. These reductions are attributed to tariffs, inflation, and broader economic uncertainty.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe significant surge in retail job cuts and the absence of holiday hiring plans challenge the perception of a robust consumer market. This trend suggests mounting economic pressures are forcing retailers to scale back operations, potentially signaling weakened consumer spending ahead.

This data reflects a challenging environment that impacts not only the retail sector but also industries more broadly.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe latest report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas extends a trend of increasing job cuts observed in prior months.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn late 2021, word got out that Midwest supermarket and convenience store operator Hy-Vee planned to enter Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee. At the time, former CEO Randy Edeker said the company knew \u201cit had so much to offer consumers across the U.S.\u201d that it felt confident in making a major expansion into new territory.\n\nThe expansion plan was a significant step for Hy-Vee, which operates about 240 supermarkets and nearly 200 c-stores. Not only would it grow its footprint from eight to 12 states and look to cement itself as a legitimate threat in the competitive Southeast market, but it would be doing so organically by constructing upwards of 20 grocery stores as well as numerous adjacent convenience stores, liquor stores and fuel stations.\n\nThe initial plan was to have 21 locations operating in the new markets by this year, according to a report from the Des Moines Register, citing a leaked internal video presentation by Edeker. Hy-Vee went on to make a series of announcements touting plans to open stores in places like Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Fishers, Indiana. But nearly four years later, not only have none of these stores opened, but ones that were expected to be built haven't even started construction.\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t been entirely quiet on the expansion front. Last year, it entered Indiana with the purchase of 22 Strack & Van Til supermarkets, which will retain their brand name and operate as a Hy-Vee subsidiary.\n\nWhere Hy-Vee planned to expand The Midwestern grocer's branded store footprint and states it planned to open new stores.\n\nYet the scope of its four-state expansion plan is still unclear. When asked to comment on these plans in early August, Hy-Vee Senior Vice President of Communications Tina Potthoff said that Hy-Vee\u2019s primary focus at the moment is expanding in Indiana. She added that Hy-Vee still owns property in Kentucky and Tennessee but did not disclose the locations or construction timelines.\n\nIn a February 2024 interview with trade publication Progressive Grocer, Hy-Vee CEO Jeremy Gosch said that inflation and high construction and inventory costs had bogged down the company\u2019s Southeast expansion plans. Officials in several cities slated for expansion said it\u2019s been years since Hy-Vee provided updates \u2014 yet none of them said the retailer has told them the project is canceled.\n\nHere\u2019s where things stand with Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion plans.\n\nFew project records and updates\n\nTennessee was expected to see the largest influx of Hy-Vee stores in this expansion, according to the Des Moines Register\u2019s 2021 account and local news reports, including two grocery stores and a distribution center in Nashville, plus several other locations across cities like Knoxville, Memphis, Murfreesboro and Spring Hill.\n\nBut while Hy-Vee confirmed it still owns property in Tennessee, it\u2019s unclear where these sites are located and what their status is.\n\nPublic records searches with Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, for example, were unable to locate updates on where Hy-Vee\u2019s plans stand, while officials with Knox County, where Knoxville is located, said in a phone call that they were unable to locate records for a planned Hy-Vee store in the county.\n\nAccording to local news reports, a Hy-Vee location in Bartlett, a suburb of Memphis, was expected to open on the corner of New Brunswick Road and Old Brunswick Road. However, last month officials in Bartlett told the Des Moines Register that the plans for a Hy-Vee store in the area had been dropped.\n\nA Hy-Vee grocery store in Grimes, Iowa, includes a large selection of fresh products, general merchandise and foodservice stations. Jeff Wells/Grocery Dive\n\nMurfreesboro and Spring Hill\u2019s records show some movement on store development, but updates fizzle out between 2022 and 2023.\n\nTwo Hy-Vee stores are slated for Murfreesboro, on Memorial Boulevard and Haynes Drive, and another off New Salem Highway near Barfield Road on the city\u2019s Southwest side, according to minutes from the Murfreesboro Planning Commission from March 2023. The commission\u2019s minutes disclosed that the Memorial Boulevard Hy-Vee site includes a 153,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center as well as a more than 10,000-square-foot liquor store. Meanwhile, the planned New Salem Highway Hy-Vee site includes a 116,000-square-foot grocery store and a 6,000-square-foot convenience store with a fueling station.\n\nBrad Barbee, Murfreesboro\u2019s principal planner, said in July the city approved the Memorial Drive project back in March 2023, but that he hasn\u2019t heard from the company in \u201csome time.\u201d Hy-Vee has until March 2026 to resume the project before the site plans expire.\n\nDespite the lack of recent communication, Barbee said he has \u201cno reason to believe [the project] isn\u2019t moving forward.\u201d\n\nSpring Hill\u2019s planned Hy-Vee storefront, meanwhile, is zoned for just over 16 acres on the Southeast corner of Buckner Lane and Buckner Road, according to city public records. In April 2022, Hy-Vee requested a \u201cconcept plan review\u201d for a grocery store and gas station. The next and last available public record, dated July 2022, is a resolution regarding the installation of water and sewer lines at the site.\n\nConstruction headaches\n\nBefore its acquisition of Strack & Van Til, Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion into Indiana was initially set to include two stores in the north Indianapolis suburbs of Zionsville and Fishers. Despite Hy-Vee\u2019s spokesperson emphasizing that the company is momentarily focused on growing in the Hoosier State, it hasn\u2019t started building either site due to construction delays, according to officials from both cities.\n\nBoth sites are supposed to share a distribution center, which also hasn\u2019t begun construction, Zionsville Mayor John Stehr said in an interview.\n\nHy-Vee\u2019s Fast & Fresh convenience store brand was also featured in its expansion plans. Jeff Wells/C-Store Dive\n\nIn a statement, Ross Hilleary, director of planning and zoning with the city of Fishers, said Hy-Vee delayed its local store due to \u201cimpending road improvements.\u201d When asked to elaborate, Hatem Mekky, Fishers\u2019 director of engineering, said the city is working on two roundabout projects \u2014 one at the intersection where Hy-Vee is expecting to build and another about two blocks away \u2014 that are slated for construction next year.\n\nHy-Vee told Stehr earlier this spring that the company is \u201cwaiting for the construction cost to come in line with their goals\u201d before they begin building Zionsville\u2019s first store, Stehr said.\n\nStehr added that he keeps in touch with Hy-Vee\u2019s team \u201cevery couple of months,\u201d and that despite the delay, he has no reason to believe they\u2019re backing out of the project or putting the property up for sale.\n\nDuring their last interaction this year, Stehr said he and Hy-Vee\u2019s team discussed the grocer\u2019s 2024 acquisition of Strack & Van Til in Northwest Indiana, which signaled that the company was active in its expansion plans.\n\nPlans on hold \u2014 or potentially never started\n\nHy-Vee\u2019s plans for Kentucky so far include just one store in Louisville. Last October, Potthoff told Louisville Business First that the grocer hadn\u2019t set a date to break ground but still planned to build the 150,000-square-foot store.\n\nIt turns out these plans were put on hold three years ago when all parking lot, grading and foundation permits for the site were withdrawn, according to records with the city of Louisville. Although Hy-Vee said it still owns the location today, the permits were axed in an April 2022 email exchange between Erin Hiscox, a project engineer with Hy-Vee, and Janice Johnston, a building inspector with the city, according to records viewed by a C-Store Dive reporter.\n\nA spokesperson from the city confirmed in July that no progress has been made on the site since this email exchange. The spokesperson said they weren\u2019t sure why Hy-Vee withdrew these permits, but said that \u201cit might have been a case where they didn\u2019t have the applicable planning applications approved yet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson from the Jefferson County Property Valuation Administrator said in a statement that they have no information to share on the site\u2019s delay.\n\n\"They say they\u2019re still coming, but their actions might indicate otherwise, and they\u2019re not really making any meaningful movement toward coming here.\" John Stehr Mayor of Zionsville, Indiana\n\nSimilarly, Hy-Vee\u2019s first Alabama store hasn\u2019t made any progress. The site was originally planned to open in Huntsville in 2023, the Des Moines Register reported in 2021, but the city appears to be unaware of the grocery chain\u2019s entrance plans.\n\n\u201cAfter consulting with our Inspections department, it appears that no plans were ever submitted and no permits were ever issued for a Hy-Vee grocery store for the City of Huntsville,\u201d the city said in response to a request for public records.\n\nWhile Potthoff confirmed Hy-Vee still has a stake in Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky, she did not give any update on whether the grocer owns property in Alabama or if it still plans to enter the state.\n\nAs Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion plans have stalled, other regional grocers and c-store chains have moved into the same states it\u2019s targeting, making any eventual move all the more challenging. Publix now operates several grocery stores in Kentucky, while Wawa and QuikTrip recently opened their first stores in Indiana. Wawa also recently opened its first store in Kentucky in late July.\n\nHy-Vee is also contending with rapidly evolving low-price retailers like Walmart, Aldi and Dollar General that operate stores in many of the same Midwest markets. Research shows that these discount retailers are putting increasing pressure on traditional grocers as consumer price sensitivity has risen.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not Hy-Vee will ever carry out its original plan, or amend it in some way, but plenty of questions linger.\n\nIn Indiana, where Hy-Vee says it\u2019s most squarely focused, Mayor Stehr admitted that he has no idea when the Zionsville store might be built, as the company hasn\u2019t updated him on any of these plans. Stehr added that he doesn\u2019t expect this store to open in 2025.\n\n\u201cI do not have 100% confidence that they\u2019re going to come here,\u201d he said. \u201cI only know what they\u2019re telling me\u2026 they say they\u2019re still coming, but their actions might indicate otherwise, and they\u2019re not really making any meaningful movement toward coming here.\u201d",

The initial goal was to have 21 locations operating in these new markets by \"this year.\" Nearly four years later, none of these organically planned stores have opened, and construction has not begun on many.

Local officials in several cities slated for expansion have not received updates, and some permits were even withdrawn, indicating severe operational delays.

The other 24 remodels will occur at Dash In stores across Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, a GSP spokesperson said in a statement to C-Store Dive.\n\nDash In is one of several convenience retailers remodeling their stores this year as the industry continues to prioritize unique, modernized layouts and formats to attract more customers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMost of today\u2019s c-store remodels have entailed building bigger stores to beef up companies\u2019 food programs and better compete with QSRs.

Two stores near La Plata, Maryland, are already complete, with 24 more planned across Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\n3 Big Numbers is a weekly column that looks at a few key details from around the c-store industry.\n\nEarlier this week, we looked back at the most impactful c-store M&A deals so far this year. Today, we\u2019re looking at the M&A landscape more broadly as businesses buckle up for the second half.\n\nTariffs have been looming, but experts are almost evenly split on whether they will have an impact on acquisition activity, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. So where do we stand?\n\nIn this week\u2019s \u201c3 Big Numbers,\u201d we look at how M&A is shaking out in 2025.\n\n20% The increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, strategic retail M&A, which includes corporate deals and add-ons, was up 20% through the first five months of the year, according to Bain & Company\u2019s midyear M&A report. And Bain thinks we\u2019ll see more deals this year.\n\n\u201cWe expect consolidation deals will continue to define the M&A market throughout 2025,\u201d Bain said in the report.\n\nBain noted that some of the companies that came through the 2008 financial crisis the strongest were those that used the downturn to strengthen and expand their businesses. That means today\u2019s uncertainty could be an opportunity for well-capitalized companies.\n\n35.7% The decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n\nWhile retail dealmaking has grown, c-stores have been notably more cautious. In fact, convenience store and fuel distribution M&A activity decreased 35.7% year-over-year through mid-May, reaching just nine announced deals, according to a report from investment banking firm Capstone Partners.\n\nActivity has picked up a little during the summer, however. Since the start of June, notable deals have included Gill Energy buying Dutchess Terminals and its 13 retail locations, Applegreen getting the rights to remodel and run 18 travel centers in Massachusetts, Sampson-Bladen Oil Co. agreeing to acquire the 15-location Breeze Thru Markets chain and MAPCO buying 35 stores from Couche-Tard.\n\nSo there\u2019s still hope that 2025 could outperform 2024.\n\n$9.1 billion The price tag on Sunoco\u2019s deal for Parkland Corp.\n\nIn June, Parkland Corp\u2019s shareholders voted to accept energy company Sunoco\u2019s $9.1 billion buyout offer. Now that Alimentation Couche-Tard has withdrawn its bid for 7-Eleven parent company Seven & i, it\u2019s quite possible this will be the biggest deal of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what Sunoco is going to do with the thousands of stores it\u2019s getting in the acquisition, but the industry will surely be watching to see whether it keeps them or sparks a new round of M&A by offloading them.\n\nWho knows? If the upward trajectory in M&A continues, maybe by the end of the year it\u2019ll get unseated at the top of the \u201cbiggest M&A\u201d heap",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Retail M&A Surges While C-Store Deals Lag Despite Key Acquisitions\n\n**Key details:**\nRetail M&A activity, including corporate deals and add-ons, increased 20% year-over-year through May. This growth is anticipated to continue defining the M&A market throughout 2025. Conversely, convenience store and fuel distribution M&A declined 35.7% year-over-year through mid-May, with only nine announced deals. However, c-store activity has picked up during the summer with several notable transactions. The largest deal mentioned is Sunoco's $9.1 billion acquisition of Parkland Corp.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article highlights a significant divergence, with strong growth in overall retail M&A but a notable slowdown in the c-store sector. This mixed performance challenges any simple consensus view on overall acquisition activity, especially concerning tariff impacts, where experts are split. The c-store decline signals caution within that specific industry, while the Sunoco-Parkland deal indicates large transactions are still possible. This divergence means well-capitalized companies may find opportunities amidst sector-specific uncertainty.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis analysis provides an overview of the M&A landscape for the second half of the year, particularly within the c-store industry. It follows an earlier review of impactful c-store M&A deals earlier this year. The market is facing uncertainty, with experts divided on whether looming tariffs will impact acquisition activity. Despite this, consolidation deals are expected to continue defining the M&A market, potentially offering opportunities for strong companies.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   20%: Increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n*   35.7%: Decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n*   9: Announced c-store deals through mid-May.\n*   $9.1 billion: Price tag of Sunoco\u2019s deal for Parkland Corp.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** Report indicated experts are split on tariff impact on M&A activity.\n*   **Bain & Company:** Reported 20% retail M&A increase and expects consolidation deals in 2025.\n*   **Capstone Partners:** Reported 35.7% decline in c-store M&A activity through mid-May.\n*   **Sunoco:** Energy company whose $9.1 billion buyout offer for Parkland Corp. was accepted.\n*   **Parkland Corp.:** Shareholders accepted Sunoco's $9.1 billion buyout offer in June.\n*   **Alimentation Couche-Tard:** Withdrew its bid for 7-Eleven parent company Seven & i.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The industry will watch to see Sunoco's strategy for its acquired thousands of stores.\n*   Ongoing M&A activity will determine if 2025 outperforms 2024.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRetail M&A is up, c-store deals are down, but large transactions persist.",

The CFTC sued Binance in 2023 as well, alleging compliance evasion. The CFTC suit settled later that year. The SEC suit, however, was dropped this year.\n\n\u201cThe shift toward coordinated regulatory frameworks is central to our strategic vision and will profoundly influence how Binance.US operates going forward. We are not just reacting to these announcements; we are actively using them to shape our business,\u201d Reed said.\n\nRipple Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty, whose firm was in a yearslong fight with the SEC until earlier this year, responded to Project Crypto on social media platform X by saying, \u201cChair [Paul] Atkins knows the prior administration pushed crypto companies offshore. He\u2019s now focused on clear, tailored standards \u2014 and drawing firm lines to curb SEC overreach.\u201d\n\nBanks, it appears, are also on board with the Trump administration\u2019s goal for crypto market primacy.\n\nIn a joint letter to Special Advisor for Artificial Intelligence and Crypto David Sacks, several industry groups wrote that the U.S. will not be able to be a global leader in digital assets and financial technology \u201cunder the status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal banking agencies\u2019 policies and guidance issued over the last few years regarding digital assets activities have hindered banks\u2019 ability to engage in those activities, and, in turn, the competitiveness of the United States financial system, as non-U.S. firms are not subject to similar requirements,\u201d wrote the associations, which included the Bank Policy Institute and American Bankers Association.\n\nThe Americas Focus Committee of the Association of Global Custodians, Financial Services Forum, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and The Clearing House Association also signed the letter.",

        "summary_text": "Small business owners are seeking more digital and data-driven insights to run their businesses, with nearly 70% prioritizing financial advice and data to grow in the next five years, according to the fourth annual business survey by Citizens published Tuesday.\n\nSmall businesses are counting on cash flow management solutions, namely advanced bill payment tools and their performance metrics like how their sales are doing or how their cash flow is working, to make informed decisions, Mark Valentino, head of business banking at Citizens, said.\n\n\u201cSmall business customers that tend to lean on cash flow tools now tend to have higher confidence, and they\u2019re focusing on prioritizing financial advice and are data-focused as well,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see this [trend] continue with generative [artificial intelligence] tools as they continue to come out in the fintech space.\u201d\n\nThough AI has not been integrated into its online banking platform, Citizens is actively exploring potential AI applications for future use and is in the \u201cfirst inning\u201d of AI adoption in banking, Valentino noted.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that small businesses will likely benefit from AI-powered solutions from fintech providers to improve operational efficiency.\n\nMark Valentino, Head of Business Banking at Citizens Permission granted by Citizens Bank\n\nThe Providence, Rhode Island-based lender has been working on the survey data and customer feedback to integrate more tools into its online banking platform and complementary software offerings over the last couple of years, including online bill pay. The lender launched Cash Flow Essentials, a cash management platform almost 18 months ago, specifically for small businesses.\n\nValentino highlighted that fintechs are pivoting from retail customers and targeting small businesses \u2014 a trend that shows both traditional banks and non-bank providers are expanding their small business toolsets to help SMBs navigate some of the economic headwinds that affect their bottom line.\n\n\u201cNow is actually a very opportune time, because between the tariffs and labor issues we\u2019re seeing small business owners trying to figure out how to optimize cash flow and how to run more efficient businesses, so these tools are going to become more and more important to their ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Valentino said.\n\nNearly 48% of those surveyed said they are adopting new financial management tools this year \u2014 five times higher than that of other companies. Meanwhile, 47% said they are leaning more heavily on expert advice from accountants, financial advisors, CPAs, and bankers compared to 6% of other companies.\n\nAmid the current \u201cconfusing time\u201d of policy changes and economic uncertainty, small businesses are looking for guidance through digital platforms and human expertise on vendor diversification strategies, cost management techniques, and operational efficiency improvements. They are showing increased interest in lines of credit, business credit cards, and other financial instruments to manage changing cash flow needs, the business banking head explained.\n\nCitizens is trying to create an \u201comnichannel\u201d experience for businesses of all sizes to ensure customers receive financial advice through multiple channels, including branch locations, which are still widely used by many companies, online platforms, phone-based support and in-person meetings with experienced bankers.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing customers want is the combination of technology that helps them get insight, coupled with access to people that could provide them with certain answers or help them as well,\u201d Valentino said.\n\nCitizens\u2019 comprehensive digital transformation strategy is focused on small business needs while keeping in mind business transition requisites across generations, as the most significant percentage of small business owners, the baby boomers, prepare to exit their businesses, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Great Wealth Transfer expects nearly $124 trillion in generational wealth to be transferred to spouses, children and grandchildren over the next 20 years,\u201d Valentino said. Nearly 42% of small businesses (revenues between $100K and $25 million) plan to transfer ownership in the next five years. Of these, approximately 28% plan to sell or transfer to someone in their family, Valentino noted, citing a Barlow research.\n\nThe regional lender\u2019s strategy acknowledges the changing demographics of business ownership and is building digital-first solutions for younger, more tech-savvy business owners taking over existing businesses or launching new ventures.\n\nThe roughly $218 billion asset lender positions itself as a leading small business banking provider in the U.S. and is expanding its geographic footprints into new markets like New York, New Jersey, Florida, and, most recently, California by establishing a business banking team in the Southern part of the state. It plans to hire additional bankers, particularly in growth markets, and continue to invest in its online banking platform, according to Valentino.\n\nThere are advanced bill pay and online payment tools scheduled for release before year-end, while more payment-focused features are planned for next year. Citizens also plans to announce some major small business-focused digital investments later this year, he noted.\n\n\u201c[Small business] is the backbone of the economy, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in this business, both in people and technology, in order to help small businesses grow in the United States,\u201d Valentino said.",

This also coincides with a \"Great Wealth Transfer,\" as baby boomers prepare to exit businesses, with new, tech-savvy owners demanding digital-first solutions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* Advanced bill pay and online payment tools are scheduled for release before year-end.\n* Citizens plans to announce major small business-focused digital investments later this year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Citizens invests in digital to meet small business' evolving financial needs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* **70%**: Small business owners prioritizing financial advice and data for growth in the next five years.\n* **48%**: Small businesses adopting new financial management tools this year, five times higher than other companies.\n* **$218 billion**: Citizens' asset size as a regional lender positioning itself as a leading small business banking provider.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* **Citizens**: Regional lender expanding its geographic footprint and investing in digital-first solutions for small businesses.\n* **Mark Valentino**: Head of business banking at Citizens, discussing small business trends and the bank's digital investment strategy.\n* **Barlow research**: Cited as the source for statistics on small businesses' plans for ownership transfer within five years.",

Additionally, the bank aims to sell its Bolt balances and the loan origination program, it said.\n\nBayFirst originated more than 6,700 Bolt loans for $870 million since 2022, it said.\n\nRobin Oliver, the bank\u2019s president and chief operating officer, called out BayFirst\u2019s 2022 and 2023 Bolt loans as a source of some discomfort, on a call with analysts last week.\n\n\"The older ones, vintages that started at lower [interest] rates, definitely have had stress and are struggling to keep up with the payments,\" Oliver said July 30.\n\nThe Bolt program offered loans of up to $150,000 to small-business borrowers. Through the 7(a) mechanism, lenders are on the hook for at least 15% of the loan, while the SBA guarantees up to 85%.\n\nOliver said BayFirst will continue to make larger SBA loans.\n\n\"I think you have different types of borrowers, more sophistication in the financial statements, and things of that nature with some of those larger borrowers,\" Oliver told analysts.\n\nThe restructuring charge will come after two straight quarters of losses for BayFirst. The $1.34 billion-asset lender lost $300,000 in the first quarter and $1.2 million in the second.\n\nBayFirst CEO Thomas Zernick cited some of the \u201cheadwinds\u201d small businesses are facing in an interview with American Banker.\n\n\"Whether it's uncertainty caused by the tariffs, cost-of-goods spikes, difficulty in employment, they're struggling across the board,\u201d Zernick said. \u201cLending into the [small-dollar] space didn't make sense, given the macroenvironment we're in today.\"\n\nBayFirst\u2019s termination of the Bolt program wouldn\u2019t be its only recent business adjustment. The bank left the national mortgage lending space in 2022.\n\nIn a release Monday, the 12-location Florida bank said it would \u201cexplore a range of opportunities intended to increase emphasis on [its] community banking activities.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, the 51 downsized jobs represent 17% of the bank\u2019s workforce. Slightly more than half \u2013 26 \u2013 are Bolt-related positions, while 25 come from other areas of the bank, BayFirst said.\n\nThe decision to terminate Bolt stemmed from a \u201ccomprehensive strategic review\u201d BayFirst\u2019s board and management undertook \u201cto reduce risk from unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loans and position the Company for long-term growth,\u201d Zernick said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cOur Board of Directors and leadership team are committed to driving innovation and resilience as we move forward into the next phase of our development,\u201d Zernick said. \u201cWe are confident that these efforts will better align the Company and our Bank with the demands of our rapidly changing banking landscape.\u201d\n\nAs to the income streams BayFirst may tap to replace Bolt, Oliver said the bank would \u201cmodel out all kinds of different scenarios to make the best decision to get us back on track in earnings and going up and to the right.\"",

The bank expects $6 million in annual cost savings but will take an unspecified restructuring charge in the third quarter. To offset this, BayFirst's board has suspended dividend payments, and directors will forgo board fees. The bank also plans to sell its Bolt loan balances and the origination program.\n\n**Why it matters:** This major restructuring comes after BayFirst reported two consecutive quarters of losses, highlighting significant financial strain. The bank's CEO cited broad \"headwinds\" for small businesses, suggesting that lending in the small-dollar space \"didn't make sense\" given the current macroenvironment. This move could signal challenges in certain segments of small business lending, potentially challenging any consensus view that all small business loan types are performing strongly.\n\n**The big picture:** BayFirst originated over 6,700 Bolt loans totaling $870 million since 2022, offering loans up to $150,000. These 7(a) loans required the lender to be on the hook for at least 15%, while the SBA guaranteed up to 85%.

The two companies have agreed to take certain actions to get full approval, although their agreements with the state are not public, he said.\n\nThe special-purpose banking credential \u2014 known as the merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter, or MALPB \u2014 lets a financial institution like a payment processor work directly with credit card networks to settle transactions, potentially cutting banks out of the process.\n\nIn such cases, banks will likely still have a role in payment processing, but Fiserv and Stripe will almost certainly use the charter to offer lower payment processing prices than their competitors or reduce their own costs, according to analysts and consultants who follow the payments industry.\n\n\"With one of these limited charters, they are the sponsor bank,\" Cliff Gray, principal at advisory firm Gray Consulting Ventures, said in an email.\n\nPrior to Fiserv, only one company \u2014 an Israeli company then known as Credorax \u2014 applied for the special banking charter. That company applied in 2012 and later changed its name to Finaro and has since been acquired by digital payments firm Shift4.\n\nThe company surrendered the charter a few years after it was granted, Fears said. Finaro was unable to use the special banking charter because credit card networks refused to work with it, according to industry consultants.\n\nHowever, Fiserv's application \"suggests the company\u2019s confidence in also being approved and getting card network membership,\" Michele Alt, a partner for the financial advisory firm Klaros Group, said in an email.",

Milwaukee-based Fiserv applied for the charter in January 2024, and Stripe, based in San Francisco and Dublin, applied in March. Both Fiserv and Stripe have received conditional approval for the charter.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe Merchant Acquirer Limited Purpose Bank (MALPB) charter allows payment processors to work directly with credit card networks, potentially bypassing traditional partner banks. This direct access could enable companies like Fiserv and Stripe to offer lower payment processing prices to clients or significantly reduce their own operational costs. Previously, Credorax (Finaro) surrendered this charter because credit card networks refused to work with it. However, Fiserv's application suggests a new confidence in securing card network membership, potentially challenging the prior consensus that the charter was unworkable.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Georgia special banking charter, officially known as the MALPB, grants a financial institution the right to settle transactions directly with credit card networks.

It is critically important to us \u2013 we measure every individual in the organization on customer service delivery, whether that's meeting that service level agreement, or whether that's getting that customer client survey back where they give us a good score.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn small business, that's important to us as well. Are we delivering great customer service? Do we have the right products and services? Are we innovative with digital mobile banking, and are we working hard on problem resolution and helping people understand how to overcome obstacles?\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the things that really resonated with me.\u201d\n\nTD\u2019s small-business segment is significant and growing, Ward said, with around 700,000 customers out of its roughly 10 million customers overall.\n\nIn his new role, Ward wants to focus on innovation \u201cfrom the product front and from the digital front,\u201d specifically around fraud prevention, a top issue for the customers he talks to on a weekly basis as mid-south regional metro president.\n\nFor now, he will serve both roles concurrently, he said, without detailing succession plans.\n\n\u201cEvery big business was a small business at one point,\u201d he noted. \u201cHow can we help them grow, whether they need working capital, equipment or real estate; and then how can we help them move up? When they move up, how can we make sure that we continue to work with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that we have a good cycle of supporting small businesses in their growth,\u201d Ward said.",

        "summary_text": "Mark Paoletta seems not to like the Government Accountability Office\u2019s tone.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s chief legal officer wrote the GAO last week, defending CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought\u2019s Feb. 8 request that the bureau receive $0 from the Federal Reserve for the fiscal quarter between April and June.\n\nThe letter comes as a response to June correspondence from the GAO, in which the congressional watchdog \u201cweaponiz[ed]\u201d the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 \u201cfor political purposes,\u201d according to Paoletta.\n\nSenate Democrats had asked the GAO to investigate the CFPB in light of multiple attempts to fire the vast majority of the bureau\u2019s workforce.\n\nOn Vought\u2019s first full day in charge of the bureau, he wrote Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to decline any further \u201cunappropriated\u201d funds \u2013 and posted about it on social media.\n\n\u201cCFPB will not be taking its next draw ... because it is not \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 to carry out its duties,\u201d Vought wrote on X. \u201cThe Bureau's current balance of $711.6 million is in fact excessive in the current fiscal environment. This spigot, long contributing to CFPB's unaccountability, is now being turned off.\u201d\n\nPaoletta last week accused the GAO of using the social post as its \u201csole predicate\u201d \u2013 rather than Vought\u2019s letter to Powell.\n\nNeither the post nor the CFPB\u2019s subsequent actions \u201ccould conceivably be construed as an illegal withholding of funds under the ICA,\u201d Paoletta wrote. \u201cConcluding otherwise would not only eviscerate the CFPB Director\u2019s discretionary authority to determine the amounts needed during the fiscal year to carry out Bureau operations, but it would also create an artificial funding floor where only a statutory ceiling exists.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB draws its funding from the Fed \u2013 a mechanism that spawned a closely watched legal case. The Supreme Court last year upheld the funding structure as constitutional. That helps Paoletta\u2019s argument \u2013 yet the CFPB legal chief, in his letter to the GAO, branded the congressionally designed mechanism as \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s essential to look at correspondence between the GAO and CFPB through the lens of time. The GAO\u2019s June letter came two weeks after the city of Baltimore voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the CFPB. Representatives of the bureau had made declarations in court that there is no mechanism to \u201ctransfer away money from, or otherwise relinquish control\u201d over money in the CFPB\u2019s reserve fund.\n\nBetween June and now, however, lawmakers passed the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill,\u201d capping the CFPB\u2019s access to funding at 6.5% of the Fed\u2019s operating budget \u2013 a decrease from 12%.\n\n\u201cCongress expressly affirmed the Acting Director\u2019s determination that the Bureau\u2019s funding level was \u2018excessive\u2019 when it reduced the cap on the Director\u2019s discretionary request authority by nearly half,\u201d Paoletta wrote to the GAO. \u201cYour boss \u2014 Congress \u2014 has thus enshrined its agreement with the Acting Director\u2019s efforts to right-size the Bureau into law.\u201d\n\nPaoletta copied House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD, on last week\u2019s letter, further asserting that the GAO\u2019s argument that the CFPB is violating the ICA \u201cundermine[s] both President [Donald] Trump and Congress.\u201d\n\nThe GAO\u2019s June letter is \u201cnot only in opposition to Acting Director Vought\u2019s laudable attempts to implement President Trump\u2019s historic reform efforts, but also in opposition to Congress\u2019s attempt to scale down an out-of-control agency,\u201d Paoletta wrote last week.\n\nPaoletta noted that the CFPB\u2019s funding does not expire at the end of a fiscal year. Rather, unused funds \u201cremain available to CFPB for obligation in future fiscal years,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVought \u201cacted well within his legal authorities in declining to request further funds from the Federal Reserve System,\u201d Paoletta wrote, noting that current law gives the CFPB acting director \u201csole discretion\u201d to determine how much money the bureau needs to function.\n\n\u201cTo read this unambiguous grant of discretion as a requirement that the Director request the full amount of funds available from the Federal Reserve is untenable and part of a politicized campaign against President Trump\u2019s historic efforts to restore fiscal sanity and efficiency to the Federal Government,\u201d Paoletta wrote. \u201cThe conclusion GAO apparently seeks \u2014 that the Acting Director\u2019s decision to decline to draw down unneeded funds constituted an illegal impoundment under the ICA \u2014 is diametrically opposed to the purpose of the ICA itself.\u201d",

Paoletta claims the GAO\u2019s June correspondence \u201cweaponiz[ed]\u201d the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 for political purposes. He asserted that neither Vought\u2019s social media post nor CFPB\u2019s actions could be construed as an illegal withholding of funds under the ICA. Paoletta argued that concluding otherwise would \u201ceviscerate\u201d the Director\u2019s discretionary authority and create an \u201cartificial funding floor.\u201d He also noted lawmakers recently passed a bill capping the CFPB\u2019s funding at 6.5% of the Fed\u2019s operating budget, a decrease from 12%.\n\n**Why it matters:** The Supreme Court last year upheld the CFPB\u2019s funding structure from the Fed as constitutional, which supports Paoletta\u2019s core argument for discretion. However, Paoletta branded this \"congressionally designed mechanism\" as \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d This information might challenge the current consensus view that the CFPB's actions constitute an illegal impoundment, as Paoletta argues it undermines Congress's recent action to \"right-size\" the Bureau. Paoletta states the GAO\u2019s argument \"undermine[s] both President [Donald] Trump and Congress,\" presenting the CFPB's actions as aligned with efforts to scale down an \"out-of-control agency.\"\n\n**The big picture:** The CFPB draws its funding from the Federal Reserve, a mechanism previously upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. Senate Democrats had asked the GAO to investigate the CFPB due to multiple attempts to fire most of its workforce. Acting Director Russ Vought, on his first full day, declined further \"unappropriated\" funds, stating the current balance of $711.6 million was \"excessive.\" Paoletta argues the CFPB\u2019s funding does not expire at the end of a fiscal year but remains available for future obligations. He claims Vought acted within his \u201csole discretion\u201d granted by current law.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$0:** Amount CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought requested from the Federal Reserve for the April-June fiscal quarter.\n*   **$711.6 million:** CFPB\u2019s current balance, which Vought stated was \"excessive.\"\n*   **6.5%:** New cap on the CFPB\u2019s access to funding, relative to the Fed\u2019s operating budget.\n*   **12%:** Previous cap on the CFPB\u2019s access to funding, prior to the recent decrease.\n*   **1974:** Year of the Impoundment Control Act, which the GAO is accused of \u201cweaponiz[ing].\u201d\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Mark Paoletta:** CFPB\u2019s chief legal officer, who wrote to the GAO defending the bureau\u2019s funding decisions.\n*   **Russ Vought:** CFPB Acting Director who requested no new funds, deeming the bureau's balance \"excessive.\"\n*   **Government Accountability Office (GAO):** Congressional watchdog that questioned CFPB\u2019s funding actions, accused of \u201cweaponiz[ing]\u201d ICA.\n*   **Federal Reserve:** Entity from which the CFPB draws its funding, subject of the current funding debate.\n*   **Jerome Powell:** Federal Reserve Chair, to whom Russ Vought wrote to decline further \"unappropriated\" funds.\n*   **Senate Democrats:** Asked the GAO to investigate the CFPB regarding its workforce and funding practices.\n*   **House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA:** Copied on Paoletta\u2019s letter, asserting GAO\u2019s argument undermines Congress.\n*   **Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD:** Copied on Paoletta\u2019s letter, representing a key congressional leader.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Mentioned as having historic reform efforts that the CFPB\u2019s actions align with.\n*   **Supreme Court:** Upheld the CFPB's funding structure from the Fed as constitutional last year.\n*   **City of Baltimore:** Voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the CFPB prior to the GAO\u2019s June letter.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** CFPB asserts legal authority in funding cut, challenging congressional watchdog.",

Chair and CEO George Makris Jr. will retire from the company and its subsidiary Simmons Bank, the company said Monday.\n\nPresident Jay Brogdon will assume the additional role of CEO and join the board, effective Jan. 1, 2026. Marty Casteel, a former chair, CEO and president of Simmons Bank who is now a director on the board, will become chair of both entities Jan. 1, the company noted. Casteel\u2019s tenure at Simmons Bank spans over 30 years.\n\n\u201cWe are very thankful to George for his decade-plus tenure as CEO, overseeing the Company's geographic transformation that led to a period of unprecedented growth, often during complex and challenging environments,\u201d Steve Cosse, lead independent director of Simmons First National Corp., said in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnder George's leadership, the Board has taken a deliberate and measured approach to succession planning,\u201d which has led to the building of a \u201ctalented executive leadership team with a long runway,\u201d he added.\n\nMakris retook the helm of the roughly $27 billion-asset company earlier this year when its then-CEO Robert Fehlman stepped down to focus on personal interests and family medical issues. Makris had served as chair and CEO from 2014 to 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Board and I are confident the time is right for this transition, and Jay is well-prepared to succeed in his new role,\u201d Makris said in a statement Monday. \u201cMarty has been a trusted colleague for many years and is eminently qualified to serve as independent Chairman.\u201d\n\nBrogdon joined the Pine Bluff, Arkansas-based company in 2021 as CFO and became the president in 2023. Prior to joining Simmons, Brogdon worked at Stephens for 13 years and most recently as managing director and as a senior accountant at Deloitte for four years.\n\n\u201cI am honored to lead Simmons and humbled to follow in the footsteps of George, Tommy May and the many incredible leaders who came before me,\u201d Brogdon said in a prepared statement. \u201cSimmons is committed to building value for our customers, communities, and shareholders, and our team does this with great integrity and passion. We will continue to build upon our longstanding culture and are excited about the opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\nBrogdon had been seen as a likely successor and is taking over after significant groundwork has been laid, analysts at Raymond James said.\n\nBrogdon took additional responsibilities this year, including overseeing the bank\u2019s information technology department, which \u201cplaces him in an even better position for taking on the CEO role,\u201d the Raymond James analysts wrote Monday.\n\nThe analysts noted that under Makris\u2019s leadership, Simmons transformed from an Arkansas community bank into a major regional institution spanning six states and successfully navigating several challenging business environments.\n\nThe announcement also signals substantial progress on key internal initiatives, including the ongoing Better Bank Initiative and a recent held-to-maturity securities restructuring, the analysts said.\n\nThey highlighted Brogdon\u2019s \u201cinstrumental role in these initiatives, where he has had a material impact on the company and its strategic direction since joining the bank just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Casteel\u2019s \u201cextensive experience and in-depth understanding of SFNC ... will prove an invaluable resource for Mr. Brogdon as he takes the helm,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn July, Simmons announced a public offering of 16,220,000 shares of its Class A common stock priced at $18.50 per share. Additionally, underwriters were given a 30-day option to purchase up to 2,433,000 additional shares at the same price with less underwriting discounts.\n\nThe offering raised roughly $326.9 million for Simmons after deductions. Simmons plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which might include investments in Simmons Bank to support a $3.2 billion balance sheet repositioning that the lender completed July 24, law firm Troutman Pepper Locke noted in a blog post.\n\nHowever, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said they do not expect a \u201cstrategy shift.\u201d\n\nRaymond James analysts said they \u201csee the appointment relieving some uncertainty while also providing confidence that the forward outlook remains on track.\u201d",

No deal has been finalized, according to the Journal. Goldman Sachs holds about $20 billion in Apple Card balances, the newspaper reported.\n\nSpokespeople for Goldman Sachs, Apple and JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nApple\u2019s annual revenue from its card business amounts to $50 million, according to analysts at Baird. That\u2019s equal to a comparatively small portion of New York City-based JPMorgan\u2019s annual revenue, which was $177.56 billion for 2024, according to its annual report.\n\nBut if JPMorgan succeeds in taking over the Cupertino, California-based tech giant\u2019s credit card business, it will have access to demographic data on millions of Apple Card users, True suggested.\n\nThe bank could then use that information to market its banking products to a slew of potential new customers, he said. Apple has data on its customers that a new partner could use to better pitch new products and services, True explained. The tech company said in January 2024 that it had 12 million Apple Card users.\n\n\"The Apple demographic is pretty well-known,\" True said. JPMorgan has \"myriad products, and now they've got many millions more customers who have Apple iPhone demographics and they can see what else those customers would be interested in.\"\n\nJPMorgan is likely eyeing other parts of Apple's business, such as the digital wallet Apple Pay, said Richard Crone, chief executive of the payments advisory firm Crone Consulting.\n\n\"Winning the Apple card portfolio would give Chase a back door to Apple Pay's wallet rails,\" he said.\n\nThat's a potentially lucrative piece of business considering the hundreds of millions of people who use the digital wallet, Crone said.\n\nApple Pay had an estimated 65.6 million users in the U.S. and 616 million globally in 2024, according to research from Capital One.",

Consultants suggest JPMorgan aims to gain access to Apple Card users for marketing other banking products. This potential move could also provide JPMorgan a \"back door\" to Apple Pay's digital wallet rails. However, no deal has been finalized.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhile Apple\u2019s card business revenue is relatively small at $50 million, consultants highlight the strategic value of accessing millions of Apple\u2019s affluent users. JPMorgan could leverage demographic data from 12 million Apple Card users to cross-sell its myriad products. This suggests the deal's true significance lies in customer acquisition and market expansion beyond just card revenue, potentially challenging a view that only considers the card's direct financial contribution.\n\n**The big picture:**\nGoldman Sachs currently manages about $20 billion in Apple Card balances. JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, is pursuing this portfolio.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Ramp Secures Mega-Funding Amid AI Agent-Driven Finance Transformation\n\n**Key details:**\nRamp, an expense management software firm, recently raised $500 million in a Series E-2 funding round, reaching a $22.5 billion valuation. This substantial funding follows the company's launch of its initial AI agents. On June 10, Ramp began rolling out specialized AI agents for controllers, designed to automatically enforce expense policies and prevent fraud. Ramp CEO Eric Glyman predicts that by 2028, autonomous AI agents will be common in corporate finance teams, managing tasks from procurement to expense management.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis news matters as Ramp\u2019s significant funding validates its bet on AI agents transforming corporate finance. Its CEO asserts AI will redeploy human talent \"up the value chain,\" rather than replacing jobs, directly challenging common automation fears about job displacement. Gartner predicts a massive jump in agentic AI adoption in enterprise software by 2028, from under 1% to 33%, and 15% of day-to-day decisions being autonomous. This suggests a much faster, more pervasive shift in corporate finance operations than current consensus might assume, posing a challenge to traditional finance software providers.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCorporate finance departments are poised for significant change, with AI agents expected to transform operations by 2028. These autonomous agents are predicted to handle diverse tasks, including procurement and expense management, overseen by an \"AI agent manager.\" This transformation comes at a \"unique moment in finance\" where more CFOs are actively testing AI tools. The rise of agentic AI heralds software that \"thinks, acts, and improves by itself,\" representing a paradigm shift in how AI systems interact with users and environments.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$500 million:** Ramp\u2019s recent Series E-2 funding round amount.\n*   **$22.5 billion:** Ramp\u2019s valuation following the Series E-2 funding.\n*   **$1.9 billion:** Total equity financing raised by Ramp.\n*   **33%:** Predicted percentage of enterprise software applications with agentic AI by 2028, per Gartner.\n*   **15%:** Predicted share of day-to-day work decisions made autonomously by AI by 2028, per Gartner.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Eric Glyman:** CEO of Ramp; wrote a blog post predicting AI will transform corporate finance operations.\n*   **Ramp:** Tech startup offering expense management software; recently secured significant funding and launched AI agents.\n*   **Will Petrie:** CFO of Ramp; commented on the company's strong balance sheet and strategy for AI in finance.\n*   **Gartner:** Research firm; predicts rapid adoption of agentic AI and advises companies on its implementation.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Ramp will continue releasing a series of specialized AI agents throughout this year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAI agents, backed by major funding, are poised to redefine corporate finance operations.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCIOs are heading into the second half of 2025 with a better sense for how AI oversight is shaping up in the U.S., given the Trump administration\u2019s AI Action Plan and the accompanying trio of executive orders.\n\nThe roadmap, released late last month, greenlights AI adoption and development acceleration across the country, including measures to expedite AI infrastructure construction and potential access to funds to retrain workers.\n\nExperts say the deregulatory direction is generally giving executives a confidence boost to fast-track strategies, but there are concerns about downstream effects and execution.\n\n\u201cEnterprises are monitoring the messaging coming from the White House, and in some cases, welcoming what would have been perceived as removing barriers,\u201d Jennifer Everett, partner at law firm Alston & Bird, told CIO Dive. \u201cIt\u2019s striking the tone from the executive branch, which will flow into the regulatory agencies, but it remains to be determined what that means for enforcement.\u201d\n\nMost organizations are navigating the evolving regulatory landscape while still trying to hit their stride with AI in terms of pursuing the right use cases, securing applications and governing strategies adequately.\n\nHere are five takeaways that CIOs should keep in mind as regulation evolves:\n\n1. Address diverging regulatory frameworks\n\nAI compliance and regulation readiness are part of the initial round of questions enterprise leaders consider in building their broader technology strategy, according to Peter Mottram, managing director in Protiviti\u2019s technology consulting practice.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to operate in certain countries, you have to be able to abide by their standards,\u201d Mottram said. \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of different ways to address diverging regulatory standards. Some are technical, but most are processes and deciding the minimum standard.\u201d\n\nDespite the adoption and development acceleration approach, the U.S. is still planning to have AI-related obligations.\n\nEverett pointed to the policy recommendation in the action plan around establishing cybersecurity standards, response frameworks and best practices. Another measure calls for creating an AI Information Sharing and Analysis Center to promote information gathering across critical infrastructure sectors.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a push for an expansion of AI, conversely, there is also an acknowledgement of appropriate cybersecurity controls in there,\u201d Everett said. \u201cEnterprises need an eye on the downflow of these obligations.\u201d\n\n2. Same show, new cast\n\nExperts have drawn parallels between data privacy legislation and current AI oversight trends.\n\nThe focus on data hygiene and process is one such through line, according to Jim Liddle, chief innovation officer of data intelligence and AI at hybrid cloud storage provider Nasuni.\n\n\u201cAll of those legislative frameworks focused a lot of companies at the time around data governance and data cleansing,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you need to do [for AI] \u2026 and one of them is you need good data governance.\u201d\n\nOrganizations that have adjusted their strategies to meet the European Union\u2019s seven-year-old General Data Protection Regulation and similar data privacy laws will potentially be in a better position to navigate the current wave of AI regulation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have global compliance teams,\u201d Martha Heller, CEO of technology executive search firm Heller. \u201cWhen it comes to AI, it\u2019s not really different \u2014 it\u2019s just data on steroids.\u201d\n\n3. Growing focus on evaluation and monitoring technology\n\nThe AI Action Plan and one of the three executive orders centers on limiting certain biases within models. Analysts say the measures raise questions and could cause downstream impacts.\n\n\u201cAnybody who works with AI knows that [large language models] have bias,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cLLMs have bias because people have bias and those LLMs ultimately are trained on data and data sets that we don\u2019t really know about.\u201d\n\nMost enterprises do not have robust processes to determine bias, according to Liddle, who cited low technical maturity.\n\n\u201cTo prove that [an AI system] is not biased and truthful is going to be a really incredibly difficult thing to do,\u201d Liddle said.\n\n4. Cross-functional collaboration with the C-suite\n\nNo AI strategy starts and ends with IT \u2014 or at least it can\u2019t anymore. When laying out a plan, the C-suite needs to come together to chart the best path.\n\n\u201cWhat they need is cross functionality,\u201d Heller said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have finance do things this way and marketing does their own thing. We need to have these big functions that used to operate a little autonomously to become one.\u201d\n\nHR, legal, compliance and other departments are enablers of sustainable strategies and can help CIOs to future-proof AI plans.\n\n5. Workforce training and AI skills\n\nCIOs have been thinking about how AI has changed \u2014 and will continue to change \u2014 workforce dynamics. AI skills come at a premium, and due to the recent skyrocketing of the technology, there isn\u2019t a large talent pool.\n\nWhile the AI Action Plan fell short of addressing agentic concerns, it broadly acknowledged the skills hurdle, calling for a \u201crapid retraining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notion of unfettered deregulation and innovation will be curtailed by other global or international policies, as it always has,\u201d Heller said. \u201cStill, it means potentially you get a grant to support your workforce training, so there\u2019s still good in there.\u201d\n\nPolicy recommendations included tax-free reimbursement for employers\u2019 AI training and skills development, as well as federal support for skills initiatives. The exact route the administration will take, however, is yet to be seen.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Wells Fargo Expands AI Use with Google, Joining Bank Productivity Push\n\n**Key details:** Wells Fargo announced a partnership expansion with Google Cloud, giving employees access to AI agents and tools. These agentic tools will support various teams, including branch and investment bankers, customer relations, and corporate staff. They are designed to help employees navigate policies, sort documentation, and provide real-time market insights. Over 2,000 Wells Fargo employees currently use Google's Agentspace, with plans for expanded access across all teams in coming months.\n\n**Why it matters:** This rollout signifies Wells Fargo's entry into the agentic stage of AI, aiming to fuel productivity within the financial services industry. While Tracy Kerrins highlights it as a \"bold step forward\" for efficiency and faster insights, CEO Charlie Scharf notes it's \"very early to see any impact of any significance from AI.\" This suggests that despite the deployment, the immediate, widespread impact on operations might be less pronounced than some might anticipate, challenging a view of immediate, significant AI transformation.\n\n**The big picture:** The financial services industry is cautiously adopting AI. Wells Fargo's move follows similar initiatives by other major firms. BNY recently deployed its multi-agentic platform Eliza for employees, as stated by CEO Robin Vince. Goldman Sachs also began piloting its AI agent, Devin, focused on software development, according to CEO David Solomon. Wells Fargo's internal generative AI team, led by Tracy Kerrins, was established less than a year ago.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 2,000 Wells Fargo employees are currently using Google's Agentspace.\n*   BNY's CEO mentioned Eliza during the company's Q2 2025 earnings call.\n*   Wells Fargo's generative AI team was stood up less than a year ago.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Latest banking firm deploying AI agents from Google Cloud for employee productivity.\n*   **Google Cloud:** Partnering with Wells Fargo to provide AI agents and tools to its employees.\n*   **BNY:** Gave employees access to its multi-agentic platform, Eliza, last month.\n*   **Robin Vince:** CEO of BNY, who discussed the Eliza platform during an earnings call.\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** Piloting its AI agent, Devin, for software development efforts.\n*   **David Solomon:** CEO of Goldman Sachs, mentioned their AI agent Devin last month.\n*   **Charlie Scharf:** CEO of Wells Fargo, addressed early AI impact on the industry in an earnings call.\n*   **Tracy Kerrins:** Wells Fargo's consumer CIO and head of enterprise generative AI team.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Wells Fargo plans to expand employee access to Google's Agentspace in the coming months across all teams.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Wells Fargo boosts AI use for efficiency, but significant industry impact is still early.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWith all the optimism about how artificial intelligence will make things more productive in the workplace \u2014 as well as the fear around its potential to displace workers \u2014 another dimension to AI in life and work is also becoming more apparent: How people are beginning to interact with the technology in new (and sometimes unsettling) ways.\n\nHR Dive spoke with Michael Elkon, partner at Fisher Phillips, about what\u2019s on the horizon for compliance and AI in the workplace.\n\nEmployees using AI to harass a co-worker\n\nWhen the internet became commonplace in the mid-to-late \u201890s, employers marveled at how it made the workplace more efficient. At the same time, \u201cpeople figured out, \u2018Oh wait, there\u2019s porn on the internet,\u2019\u201d Elkon said.\n\nSuddenly, explicit images and videos could not only be accessed easily, but shared with or sent to others. That sharing led to Title VII lawsuits alleging sexual harassment.\n\nElkon noted the recent story of a teenager in Spain who used AI to deep-fake nude images of classmates. It isn\u2019t much of a leap, he said, to imagine employees using the same technology and methods against co-workers.\n\nEventually, \u201clurid stories like that \u2026 are going to migrate into the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkers becoming overly attached to AI \u2014 romantically or otherwise\n\nRecently, a story went viral of a New Jersey man who reportedly fell in love with an AI chatbot and proposed \u2014 despite already having a wife and a two-year-old child. Far from being just the plot of a science fiction film, people are already beginning to develop seemingly unhealthy attachments to AI tools, and some of those attachments are happening at work, Elkon said.\n\nElkon spoke on the topic at a SHRM 2025 conference session earlier this summer alongside his wife, Andrea, a clinical psychologist. During the Q&A portion of the session, an HR leader stepped forward to say the issue had already cropped up at her workplace with a former employee.\n\n\u201cYou have this whole overlay where you have younger people who are used to AI in their day-to-day lives. You have younger people who are specifically using AI for emotional functions, because it gets around the loneliness that a lot of people feel. And then you dump AI tools into the workplace,\u201d Elkon said. \u201cIt then becomes something that you sort of have to address.\u201d\n\nWorkers requesting AI as a reasonable accommodation\n\nAs workers grow more familiar with \u2014 and potentially dependent on \u2014 AI, both to accomplish tasks and for emotional support, employers are likely to see a growing set of AI accommodation requests, Elkon noted.\n\nAI is poised to be a game-changer when it comes to accessibility, making it likely employers will contend with a variety of requests to acquire or use tools that better enable workers to do their job. While these types of requests are likely familiar territory, a worker with anxiety or autism could similarly request constant access to a chatbot for emotional or social support \u2014 something most employers likely haven\u2019t dealt with before.\n\nWhile these new concerns may introduce new situations for employers, going back to the basics can help them begin to develop policies and make decisions. For example, whatever the request, the interactive process is still the gold standard for settling on accommodations: \u201cCourts have frameworks already,\u201d Elkon said. AI is \u201cjust a new piece of technology that can potentially get involved in a reasonable accommodation analysis.\u201d\n\nAnd for more novel circumstances, like AI situationships in the workplace? There\u2019s no real playbook quite yet.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re sort of on the cusp of a lot of things,\u201d Elkon said. \u201cLike any other technological advance, people are going to have to figure out, you know, what are the right and wrong ways to use it.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** AI's Human Impact Unveils Workplace Compliance Risks\n\n**Key details:**\nNew concerns are emerging regarding how employees interact with artificial intelligence in the workplace. These include the potential for workers to use AI tools, such as deepfakes, to harass co-workers, leading to issues similar to past Title VII lawsuits. Additionally, employees are reportedly developing unhealthy attachments, including romantic ones, to AI chatbots, with instances already observed in workplaces. Employers also anticipate a rise in requests for AI tools as reasonable accommodations for both task completion and emotional or social support.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information highlights unforeseen human resource and legal challenges associated with AI integration beyond productivity gains. It suggests that while AI promises efficiency, companies must now factor in new compliance costs and potential liabilities. The emergence of AI-related harassment and emotional attachments could lead to novel legal situations for which no clear playbook exists yet. This challenges a consensus view that AI's workplace impact would be primarily focused on operational improvements, introducing a complex new dimension of risk management.\n\n**The big picture:**\nOptimism around AI's productivity benefits is tempered by growing concerns about its potential to displace workers and how people are interacting with the technology. Just as the internet introduced new workplace challenges like harassment in the mid-to-late '90s, AI is creating a similar dynamic. Younger generations are already using AI for emotional functions outside of work, and these behaviors are now migrating into professional settings. While courts have frameworks for some issues like reasonable accommodations, novel AI-related \"situationships\" lack clear precedent.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   The internet became commonplace in the mid-to-late \u201890s.\n*   A SHRM 2025 conference session on AI in the workplace was held earlier this summer.\n*   A New Jersey man reportedly fell in love with an AI chatbot despite having a two-year-old child.\n*   A teenager in Spain used AI to deep-fake nude images of classmates.\n*   Title VII lawsuits resulted from explicit image sharing via the internet.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Michael Elkon:** Partner at Fisher Phillips, discussed the future of AI compliance in the workplace.\n*   **HR Dive:** News publication that interviewed Michael Elkon regarding AI workplace issues.\n*   **Fisher Phillips:** Law firm where Michael Elkon is a partner focusing on compliance.\n*   **Andrea Elkon:** Clinical psychologist and Michael Elkon's wife, spoke on AI attachment at a conference.\n*   **SHRM:** Organization that hosted a 2025 conference session featuring the Elkons discussing AI.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAI's integration introduces new, unforeseen workplace compliance and legal risks for employers.",

The industry functions in a strict regulatory environment, processing billions of daily transactions teeming with sensitive personal information and safeguarding systems critical to daily business and long-term economic well-being.\n\nAs financial firms move forward with generative AI adoption, leveraging data at scale without compromising its integrity or security becomes a delicate balancing act and a potential roadblock to scaling the technology.\n\n\u201cThe workflows are as secure as the people running them, so you have to make sure that every employee knows they have to follow policies for handling data,\u201d Leon Bian, VP and head of Databolt product at Capital One Software, told CIO Dive. \u201cData analysts, data scientists and data engineers have to follow the right hygiene.\u201d\n\nThe financial firm, which launched its software division in 2022 and deployed data management platform Slingshot the same year, turned to tokenization as a potential security solution two years ago and set about engineering an alternative to traditional encryption.\n\nIn April, Capital One Software completed the commercial rollout of its second product, Databolt. The platform replaces sensitive data with tokens, preserving the underlying formatting while enabling security third-party sharing and generative AI ingestion.\n\n\u201cWhen you encrypt the data, it changes the format, and you have to decrypt the data every time you run an operation,\u201d Bian said. Tokenization keeps the original format unchanged \u2014 a social security number remains a nine-digit string \u2014 while shielding the sensitive data point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cleaner, faster and more secure way for data analysts to work with data,\u201d Bian said. \u201cInternally, we don\u2019t feed any sensitive data into a large language model unless it has been tokenized.

Cloud served as a foundation for AI adoption, the company told CIO Dive in January.

        "summary_text": "In today\u2019s cost-conscious climate, Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are being asked to achieve the impossible: deliver more innovation with fewer resources. Cut budgets. Freeze hiring. Delay critical upgrades. On the surface, it seems reasonable to scale back or delay long-range investments, particularly in complex foundational projects such as data management and unification.\n\nBut in 2025, there\u2019s one truth that enterprise leaders can\u2019t afford to ignore:\n\n\u201cGood enough\u201d data is no longer good enough. Not for AI. Not for compliance. Not for growth.\n\nAs enterprises lean harder into AI to gain a competitive edge, the cost of poor data infrastructure is compounding. When CIOs defer data unification or settle for patchwork solutions, they don\u2019t just create technical debt\u2014they increase the likelihood of catastrophic AI misfires, regulatory risk, and lost revenue.\n\nWhen \u201cgood enough\u201d leads to data debt\n\nWhen we talk to CIOs, we often hear a familiar refrain: \u201cOur data is good enough for now.\u201d It\u2019s an understandable response in a climate of budget scrutiny and competing priorities. But what does \u201cgood enough\u201d really mean? And is it truly enough for the demands of AI, automation, and modern digital operations? For many organizations, \u201cgood enough data\u201d typically means relying on fragmented systems, outdated records, and manual processes patched together to meet immediate needs. It might work\u2014until it doesn\u2019t.\n\nAs enterprises strive for faster, more intelligent, and automated operations, this mindset can become a hidden liability. Before exploring the risks, it\u2019s essential to define what \u201cgood enough\u201d data looks like in practice.\n\n\u201cGood enough\u201d data often carries significant invisible baggage. Inconsistent, siloed information creates inefficiency, errors, and exposure that many leaders underestimate.\n\nConsider these eye-opening figures about the toll of fragmented and low-quality data:\n\nProductivity Drain: Knowledge workers spend nearly 30% of their workweek searching for information across fragmented systems \u2013 roughly 11.6 hours per week lost per employee that could have been spent on strategic work, according to a survey from Airtable and Forrester Consulting.\n\nDirect Financial Losses: Poor data quality is a bottom-line problem. Gartner estimates it costs organizations an average of $15 million per year. \u201cGood enough\u201d data means decisions are often based on flawed or incomplete information, leading to revenue losses and extra costs to correct mistakes.\n\nCompliance and Security Risks: Fragmented data also undermines security and compliance. Disconnected systems make it hard to enforce uniform controls. One analysis found that 70% of organizations with data silos suffered a breach in the past two years; meanwhile, regulators issued \u20ac1.2 billion in GDPR fines in 2024. \u201cGood enough\u201d may work for basic operations, but it fails under scrutiny.\n\nAI initiatives derail without quality data\n\nFeeding \u201cgood enough\u201d data into AI will yield questionable results. Indeed, studies confirm that many AI projects fail due to data issues.\n\nA 2024 Reltio survey found that only 20% of data leaders reported that more than half of their enterprise AI initiatives have been successful. Poor data quality was the primary reason for failed or stalled AI projects.\n\nMost AI efforts don\u2019t flounder because the algorithms are flawed; they fail because the data feeding them isn\u2019t up to par. Even the most powerful AI models produce flawed results when information is fragmented, inaccurate, or outdated.\n\nGenerative AI only heightens the urgency for better data. Enterprises are rushing to pilot generative AI projects, but many will stall. Gartner predicted that 30% of all generative AI projects will be abandoned at the proof-of-concept stage, often due to poor data quality.\n\nBuilding a unified data foundation\n\nIf the era of \u201cgood enough\u201d data is over, what\u2019s the path forward? It begins with a unified, high-quality data foundation. Modern cloud data platforms, such as Reltio\u2019s Data Cloud, help CIOs tackle this challenge. Instead of one-off integrations or siloed cleansing projects, they provide an integrated approach to unify and cleanse enterprise data continuously.\n\nThese platforms combine data from every source into a single source of truth, utilizing AI to match and merge records, ensuring that all teams share a comprehensive view of the business. They also embed continuous data quality into data flows, validating, standardizing, and enriching data in real-time to ensure information remains consistent and trusted. They bake in governance and compliance controls (e.g., consent tracking and audit trails) to enforce privacy and security policies across all data. And being cloud-native, they easily scale to handle massive data volumes while delivering fast time-to-value. For example, Reltio reports that companies can use trusted, unified data in as little as 90 days.\n\nNo more \u201cGood Enough\u201d: Make data excellence the strategy\n\nCompeting today demands a trusted enterprise data foundation, and CIOs must lead by refusing to accept fragmented, \u201cgood enough\u201d data. Building an enterprise-wide data foundation requires effort and investment, but the payoff is transformative: AI projects that succeed, teams freed from tedious data wrangling, and compliance requirements met proactively instead of reactively.\n\nIt\u2019s time for CIOs to show that better data means better business. The rules of data management have changed. Every enterprise is under pressure to adapt now or risk an uncertain future. By rethinking data risk today, CIOs ensure unseen data pitfalls won\u2019t derail their organization\u2019s AI ambitions, because in the AI era, trusted data is a strategic advantage. Organizations that realize this will leave \u201cgood enough\u201d behind and race ahead with data-driven innovation.\n\nVisit Reltio to learn more about the enterprise data rules that are crucial to unlocking the potential for agentic AI.\n\nAbout the Authors",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCrime statistics unavoidably present an incomplete picture, simply because many crimes are not detected or reported. Such is the case with corporate fraud stats, as well.\n\nIn 2024, U.S. public companies lost an average of 1.06% of their revenue to known fraud, according to a new survey by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and the Anti-Fraud Collaboration. That virtually replicated the previous year\u2019s 1.07% average.\n\nHowever, unknown fraud may be multiple times more expensive, according to the survey, whose 369 participants estimated that the real cost of fraud \u2014 detected and undetected \u2014 is actually 2.5% of revenue.\n\nHalf of the study participants were current employees of U.S. public companies in roles such as fraud examiner, internal auditor, compliance or ethics professional, risk management professional and financial statement preparer.\n\nAdditionally, 29% of those surveyed were in governance roles (i.e., board of directors or audit committee members), 14% were external consultants or advisers, and the rest were external auditors or employees of a government agency with regulatory or investigative authority.\n\n\u201cEven for frauds that do come to light, the full amount of the loss might not be determinable,\u201d the report said. ACFE research also shows that about half of internal frauds last more than 12 months before being detected, \u201cMeaning some frauds that were occurring in 2023 and 2024 were likely not yet included in the known fraud losses for those years.\u201d\n\nThe survey asked participants to rate both the likelihood and significance of six categories of fraud. Cyberfraud was the worst offender in both senses by a substantial margin. Financial statement fraud was the least likely to occur, but had the second-worst consequences. Customer payment fraud was the second-most likely, but had the least significance.\n\nAll three of the most likely types of fraud were external in nature. In addition to cyberfraud, they included fraud by vendors and sellers and customer payment fraud.\n\nThe sixth type of fraud, asset misappropriation/embezzlement, was second-lowest in significance and the middle of the pack in likelihood.\n\nAs dire as survey participants were about the current specter of fraud, they\u2019re also pessimistic about the future. Two-thirds (66%) of them said they expect an increase in the overall level of fraud over the next two years, compared to only 17% who forecasted decreased fraud.\n\nCompany employees and governance officials were asked what could be done differently to better deter fraud or detect it sooner at their company. The runaway top response could hardly be more straightforward: More than half (56%) simply recommended more or improved proactive and continuous monitoring for fraud.\n\nFifteen percent advocated for new or improved use of technology or AI, and 13% suggested enhanced efforts related to fraud awareness training and an anti-fraud culture.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nA proactive approach to streamlining back-office operations, such as vendor-invoice processing, can free up considerable amounts of cash that finance leaders can reinvest in talent or technology.\n\nOrganizations can assess the efficiency of accounts payable by benchmarking the metric \u201ctotal cost to perform the AP function per $1,000 revenue.\u201d At the American Productivity & Quality Center, we define this as including all AP-related labor, technology, overhead and outsourced services, divided by total revenue, then multiplied by $1,000.\n\nWhile AP processing might not be a finance leader\u2019s first cost-cutting target, taking steps to improve performance here can generate unexpected savings. According to APQC benchmarking data, top performers spend just $0.38 per $1,000 in revenue on AP, while bottom performers spend $0.92. For a billion-dollar company, that\u2019s a difference of more than $500,000 annually.\n\nHow to reduce AP costs\n\nSo how do you move the needle on this metric? There are some structural changes that often turn bottom-performing organizations into top performers. If your organization\u2019s AP function is decentralized, with staff or systems operating in various business units or regional offices, consider consolidation through a shared service model. When feasible, this strategy usually reduces costs significantly. Another option is to outsource AP processes, but beware, because outsourcing comes with a loss of control and visibility.\n\nWithout making a major transformation or strategic shift, however, you can implement small tactical changes that lead to big efficiency gains. Here are three key strategies:\n\n1. Develop clear policies and procedures. Ensure vendor payment terms, including payment timelines, freight or shipping charges, and taxable status, are clearly documented in initial agreements and covered during a standard vendor onboarding process. This avoids confusion and reduces time spent on resolving issues later.\n\n2. Increase invoice accuracy and controls. Whether payments to vendors are processed manually or through an automated system, having checks and balances in place that prevent duplicate invoice entries reduces the risk of errors and rework. Most modern enterprise resource planning systems are equipped with duplicate detection capabilities. Making electronic payments generally reduces the risk of errors or other issues.\n\n3. Improve vendor communications. Standardize and communicate invoice submission processes, such as whether invoices should be sent by email or through an online portal, to maintain consistency across all vendors and locations. Additionally, identify a specific contact person for each vendor to reach out to in the event of a payment issue. These steps help reduce both the number of potential problems and the time it takes to reach a resolution.\n\nCash management strategy\n\nOptimizing AP is part of an organization\u2019s overall cash management strategy and goes hand in hand with accounts receivable management. To achieve peak performance, cash inflows should match outflows. In other words, an organization\u2019s days payable outstanding should coincide with its days sales outstanding.\n\nOther supporting metrics to monitor for opportunities to improve AP efficiency include:\n\nCost per invoice processed\n\nInvoice cycle time\n\n% of electronic vs. paper payments\n\nAP FTEs per $1B revenue\n\nImproving performance on these measures while balancing DPO and DSO requires careful monitoring and management. The payoff is a better cash position that increases organizational agility and resilience.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe following is a guest post from Swetha Pandiri, manager of FP&A business systems at Kaiser Aluminum. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nFinance leaders are surrounded by data and often lead some of the most expensive investments in business intelligence tools and data automation initiatives across the firm. Yet in most scenarios, they roll back to offline spreadsheets and manual reconciliations to validate key metrics.\n\nAt the root of this problem is a lack of alignment across data sources, key metric definitions and reporting structures. Different business units often operate on separate systems, develop their own performance indicators and interpret results through local logic. As a result, even basic questions around operating expenses, procurement activity or working capital can generate multiple answers depending on who is asked, and which report is referenced. This fragmentation is not only operationally inefficient but also undermines decision-making. Executives are forced to spend time validating data rather than interpreting it, and financial analysts devote hours each month to re-explaining numbers to stakeholders.\n\nWhile CFOs are expected to revolutionize data innovations in the organization, they often inherit reporting environments and legacy ERP systems shaped by outdated processes and fragmented data ownership. While these challenges are complex, CFOs are well-positioned to lead the solution since they hold a unique view across both financial and operational systems. This broad perspective, combined with finance\u2019s responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of reporting, makes them the natural leader for enterprise reporting reform.\n\nCFOs who succeed in fixing fragmented reporting often rely on a collaborative approach between IT and finance, where a finance technology leader acts as a liaison who understands both the systems that manage data and the financial context behind the data. This combined perspective helps bridge the technical and functional gaps that frequently hinder transformation efforts.\n\nThe following steps offer a structured approach that organizations can use to build sustainable and practical reporting improvements.\n\n1. Diagnose the sources of fragmentation\n\nThe first step is to understand the flow of data. Start by focusing on three primary areas: source systems, reporting logic and stakeholders' usage. This means looking beyond individual reports and focusing instead on where the data comes from, how it is calculated and how it is used across different teams. In many companies, the underlying data may come from the same ERP system, but the problem lies in how different teams consume and interpret it.\n\nThis exercise helps uncover such discrepancies in definitions and manual workarounds to adjust the numbers. It also often shows a lack of governance and ownership over the data.\n\n2. Establish governance and accountability\n\nEstablishing a reporting governance framework that defines ownership, data standards and review processes would be a crucial next step. This includes setting clear definitions for key metrics, outlining the calculations involved and identifying any customizations required by cross-functional teams. Each report or metric should have a designated owner responsible for maintaining definitions, managing updates and ensuring consistent usage.\n\nThis phase helps establish data standards that can improve clarity and collaboration across teams and allows reporting to scale with the business.\n\n3. Invest in building a centralized data foundation\n\nOnce reporting gaps are identified and governance is in place, the next step is to ensure that the reporting structure is supported by a reliable data foundation. In most organizations, key financial and operational data is spread across multiple systems like ERP, procurement, budgeting tools and spreadsheets. A centralized data warehouse brings this data together into a structured environment where it can be transformed, standardized and made report-ready. While many pre-built data warehouse solutions are available in today's market to address these challenges, those solutions are only effective when paired with internal ownership and oversight.\n\nThe data warehouse should do more than store raw data. It should be designed with a structured approach \u2014using models such as the medallion architecture, for example \u2014 to organize and prepare data for reporting. Business rules such as mappings, calculations and flags must be built directly into the data layer, aligned with definitions agreed upon during the governance process. That logic should exist in one place and be applied consistently across all reports.\n\nA well-structured warehouse provides the foundation for data to flow cleanly from transactional systems into analytical tools. This is essential to keep reporting reliable, repeatable and free from rework.\n\n4. Promote a culture of reuse and data literacy\n\nOnce the core metrics are defined, ownership is in place and the data warehouse is structured to reflect that logic, the next step is to ensure these standards are adopted across the organization. CFOs should reinforce the use of approved reports and shared data models, rather than allowing each team to rebuild metrics on their own. This will lead to more consistent outputs and reduce the time spent maintaining disconnected logic.\n\nData literacy is another big part of this equation. The finance team should lead this effort by helping business users understand what each metric means, how it is calculated and where the data comes from. Taking advantage of features offered by modern data warehouse platforms, such as data cataloging, defined KPI rules and metric documentation, should be the starting point. This becomes especially important as more teams rely on self-service tools to make decisions.\n\n5. Start small, focusing on one domain to build momentum\n\nOnce the foundational work is in place, the next step is to apply it in a focused, practical way. Widespread reporting transformation can feel overwhelming. Instead of attempting to fix all reporting at once, finance leaders should select one domain where the fragmentation is both visible and impactful, such as capital expenditures, procurement or operational expenses.\n\nUsing the standardized definitions, trusted data sources and governance structure already established, the team can align stakeholders and deliver one complete, consistent reporting solution. While this approach helps validate the framework, it also builds credibility. A well-executed rollout in a single area demonstrates what \u201cgood\u201d looks like and helps others see the benefit of adopting the same standards.\n\nCreating a repeatable model\n\nReporting transformation gains momentum not by scale, but by trust. Starting small allows finance to lead with confidence and bring others along through results, not mandates.\n\nAddressing fragmented reporting requires more than surface-level fixes. It takes a deliberate approach that starts small, focuses on what matters most and scales with clarity. The CFO is in a position to lead this shift not only because finance is accountable for the numbers, but because it sits at the intersection of strategy, operations and systems. The steps outlined form a repeatable model that brings structure to how information flows through the organization. When applied with discipline, this structure supports faster decisions, fewer errors and clearer alignment across teams.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Fragmented Data Hinders CFOs, Undermining Business Decisions.\n\n**Key details:**\nFinance leaders, despite investing heavily in business intelligence tools, frequently revert to manual spreadsheets. This issue stems from a lack of alignment across data sources, key metric definitions, and reporting structures within organizations. As a result, even basic questions about expenses or working capital can yield multiple answers, leading to operational inefficiencies and undermining executive decision-making. Financial analysts are forced to spend hours each month re-explaining numbers to stakeholders.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe pervasive fragmentation of data undermines decision-making by forcing executives to validate information rather than interpreting its strategic implications. This challenges the common consensus that investing in business intelligence tools alone solves data issues, emphasizing that the underlying problem is a fundamental lack of alignment. It also challenges the view that data innovation is solely an IT function, highlighting CFOs' unique position to lead this critical reporting reform given their broad perspective across financial and operational systems.\n\n**The big picture:**\nWhile CFOs are expected to revolutionize data innovations within organizations, they often inherit legacy ERP systems and reporting environments plagued by fragmented data ownership. Despite these complex challenges, CFOs are uniquely positioned to lead the solution due to their unparalleled view across both financial and operational systems. This broad perspective, combined with finance's accountability for accurate and timely reporting, makes them the natural leader for enterprise reporting reform.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCarlos Cabrera took over the CFO role at Patreon last month after spending nearly a decade rising through the company\u2019s ranks. A Stanford-trained structural engineer, Cabrera joined the media and community platform for creators as its first data scientist in 2015 and has since overseen functions ranging from data science and finance to corporate development, HR, sales, and marketing.\n\nNow as CFO, Cabrera brings a rare blend of financial modeling skills and \u201cdeep creator empathy\u201d to the role. His diverse background includes building statistical risk models for natural disasters and drumming in the indie band Pomplamoose. He sees Patreon\u2019s payments infrastructure, global tax complexity and creator-first culture as key strategic priorities as the platform scales beyond $10 billion in cumulative payments.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, Cabrera shares how he evaluates risk, navigates challenges around global payments and the future of human work in a world increasingly shaped by AI.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Patreon\n\nCarlos Cabrera\n\nCFO, Patreon\n\nFirst CFO Position: 2025\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nElectro-Harmonix\n\nRisk Management Solutions\n\nStanford University\n\nADAM ZAKI: You\u2019ve been with Patreon for 10 years. Why become CFO now?\n\nCARLOS CABRERA: It\u2019s a mix of how my role has evolved and what the company needs at this stage.\n\nI started as a data scientist, though from the beginning it was clear my job was company building. I joined as one of 24 employees and spent the first couple of years coding. I built things like the creator earnings dashboard, which didn\u2019t exist before.\n\nFrom there, I built the data science team, took on HR and hired a head of HR. At different times, I also oversaw sales, marketing, legal, trust and safety, compliance, corporate development and our Memberful unit. So I\u2019ve effectively led across the company.\n\nAt the C-level, especially as CFO, you often have to step in when things break. I\u2019ve done that repeatedly, and it\u2019s clear to [our CEO] Jack Conte and the board that I\u2019ve operated at that level.\n\nOn the company side, at $100 million in revenue and 50,000 customers, we may not have needed a CFO. But now we\u2019re at more than $2 billion in annual payments, over $10 billion cumulative with 300,000 creators and 400+ employees. The scale demands it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your goal as CFO?\n\nPatreon has over 300,000 creators making money on the platform. We pioneered the idea of creators building direct fan relationships, and we\u2019re the market leader. OnlyFans is the only real exception, and that\u2019s a very different model.\n\nEven with our scale, we still see ourselves as small. There are millions of creators globally, and we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. Our market penetration is likely below 0.5%. Our market penetration is likely below 0.5%, and over the next 10 years, the total number of creators will explode.\n\nAI will massively disrupt jobs. As machines take over more tasks, people will gravitate toward creative expression and community. Those are two things that define what creators do. Whether it\u2019s woodworking, gardening, music or software engineering, honing a craft and connecting with others are deeply human. That\u2019s the future of work, and it aligns perfectly with what Patreon enables.\n\nSo, growth is the top priority. Not just in a revenue sense, but in creating more value for creators and fans. Yes, I care about margins and efficiency, but my main focus is expanding our reach and impact. AI isn\u2019t something we\u2019re building, but it\u2019s a huge tailwind for us. The creator economy is going to get much bigger, and we want to lead that transformation.\n\nHow does your unique background shape how you lead?\n\nThere are really three parts to my experience. First is engineering. I studied civil and structural engineering at Stanford, including a master\u2019s, and worked mostly in simulation, specifically finite element modeling. I built statistical models for insurance clients to assess financial risk from earthquakes and other natural disasters. We worked with massive datasets. Microsoft was a direct partner. That made me good at modeling, and that skill has translated directly into financial modeling. I can model the hell out of anything.\n\nSecond is music. I\u2019ve played drums since sixth grade. My cousin was a conductor for the San Francisco Opera and the Las Vegas Philharmonic. My uncle was Neil Young\u2019s bass player for his whole career, and another uncle and aunt were caretakers of Neil\u2019s ranch in Woodside, California. When I was at Stanford, I\u2019d drive over the hill to hang out at the ranch and ended up playing regularly with some of the guys in Neil\u2019s band. Music has always been a major part of my life.\n\nCarlos Cabrera (left) and CEO Jack Conte (right) during a Pomplamoose show. Permission granted by Carlos Cabrera\n\nWhen I met Jack as a freshman at Stanford, he came to one of my shows and asked me to join a band with him. That eventually became Pomplamoose. I played drums in that band for over a decade and toured all over the country. Most of my close friends and family are creators, so working at Patreon feels incredibly personal. I just call people in my life to understand what creators need.\n\nThat combination of technical modeling and deep creator empathy is what makes this role feel natural to me. I never thought I\u2019d stay at a company for over 10 years, but I care so much about our mission that I can\u2019t walk away from it. It feels like I don\u2019t have a choice. I have to keep building this.\n\nHas the global B2B payment infrastructure held you back as you\u2019ve scaled?\n\nPayments are challenging. One key distinction between Patreon and other platforms is that, on most platforms, creators have to set up their own Stripe or PayPal accounts. That keeps the platform out of the payments flow and makes the creator the merchant of record. So they\u2019re responsible for taxes, fraud and chargebacks.\n\nPatreon took a different approach. Fans pay Patreon and creators withdraw funds from their Patreon accounts. That makes us the merchant of record, so if something goes wrong \u2014 chargebacks, tax issues, fraud \u2014 it\u2019s on us, not the creator.\n\nThis also improves the experience. If a fan supports three creators, they get one charge from Patreon, not three separate ones. That helps reduce churn. To support this, we\u2019ve built multiple payment processor integrations and dynamically route transactions by geography or content type to improve success rates and lower costs. It\u2019s a lot of work, but it allows us to offer more payment options, manage risk and simplify things for creators.\n\nInternationally, it\u2019s a huge value. If a Canadian creator has fans in Luxembourg, we handle VAT, remit taxes to the right authority and deal with any compliance issues, even retroactively. Creators don\u2019t have to think about it.\n\nWith this, tax is wickedly complicated for us. We have tens of millions of customers in almost every country \u2014 only a handful of exceptions. Our tax situation involves tens of thousands of returns each year. We have corporate obligations in places like the U.S., Ireland, Portugal, the U.K. and Australia. And as a platform, we handle taxes for tens of millions of fans and hundreds of thousands of creators globally. It\u2019s a massively complex part of what our finance team takes ownership of.\n\nHow did your work in engineering and earthquake modeling affect the way you think about risk?\n\nIt taught me to focus on rare but high-impact events, the kind people often overlook because they don\u2019t happen every year. My early career was spent building statistical models to predict those risks for insurers, and I bring that same mindset to business. I think beyond the obvious and prepare for low-probability, high-consequence scenarios.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t just model disasters. I responded to them. After the Haiti earthquake in 2010, I flew into the Dominican Republic, crossed the border and worked in collapsed hospitals and chaotic environments. I also responded to major disasters in Japan, Chile, Indonesia and other regions. What I realized is that I operate well in fast-moving, ambiguous, high-stakes situations. I can stay calm, think clearly and lead when others are overwhelmed.\n\nThat\u2019s directly shaped how I lead at Patreon. Even as we've scaled, we still face moments of uncertainty, big strategic pivots or unexpected external changes. My experience helps me navigate those moments and guide the company through them.\n\nI don\u2019t think a CFO\u2019s job is to minimize risk. It\u2019s to manage and take the right risks. We have less than half a percent market share in a rapidly expanding space. We need to be bold. We have to be solid in how we handle payments and money, but aggressive in how we grow and evolve the product.\n\nDo you have a mentor, or someone outside of Patreon you can go to for insight?\n\nYes. I think having mentors is essential. You need people outside your company who can help you think through complex situations, and you also need feedback from CFOs at larger companies to keep growing.\n\nAround 2016, I started reading Shopify\u2019s financials and realized their structure, with a platform, payments and capital offerings, was very similar to what we were trying to build at Patreon, just for creators instead of retailers. I thought, \u2018We should build [things like] Patreon Payments, Patreon Capital \u2014 the Shopify model, but tailored to digital content.\u2019\n\nI found Shopify\u2019s former CFO, Russ Jones, and sent him a cold email. I said, \u2018I\u2019ve read everything Shopify has published. I have some questions. Pick any day and I\u2019ll fly to Ottawa and take you out for breakfast or lunch to talk.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I flew to Ottawa, we met and that turned into a long-term mentorship. We still talk; I had a call with him just two weeks ago.\n\nThat relationship grew into something broader. Shopify\u2019s head of data mentored some of our engineering leaders. Our marketing teams connected. [Conte] then built a great relationship with Shopify\u2019s CEO. We learned a lot through the connection with Shopify.\n\nAnother key mentor is Rob Krolik, the former CFO of Yelp. I met him during a Wharton course on CFO leadership, and now I call him whenever I\u2019m facing a tricky or sensitive issue. Ethics questions, high-stakes decisions or just stuff that\u2019s hard to talk through internally. He\u2019s been a fantastic resource.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSeismic, a sales enablement software platform used by large go-to-market teams, is closing in on $400 million in annual recurring revenue and has already reached profitability. Behind that highly sought-after mark is an in-sync CFO-chief revenue officer relationship between Evan Goldstein and Hayden Stafford.\n\nGoldstein, who joined Seismic as CFO in 2022 after leadership roles at Genentech and Salesforce, is a first-time finance chief focused on creating what he calls \u201cstructured chaos\u201d\u2014 supporting innovation while enforcing financial rigor. Stafford, the company\u2019s CRO and an enterprise sales veteran with prior stints at IBM, Salesforce and Microsoft, joined around the same time. Though they didn\u2019t work together directly during their shared time at Salesforce, at Seismic, they\u2019ve built a model for high-growth SaaS leadership that\u2019s based on collaboration, transparency and shared ownership of growth and profitability.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, [collaboration with leadership] is like parenting,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cDisagreements rise to the top, and we have to present a united front. Hayden and I have invested in the relationship, and that\u2019s made us far more effective at managing any tension and keeping the organization moving forward.\u201d\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nOne of Goldstein\u2019s priorities as CFO was rebuilding Seismic\u2019s finance organization, moving it beyond accounting to become a forward-looking strategic partner. \u201cThe culture here was very accounting-driven,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not knocking accountants, but you need a broader set of skills to really support decision-making at scale.\u201d\n\nHe brought in a new controller, head of FP&A, a procurement lead and a VP of finance to unify the organization and embed it more deeply in go-to-market operations. \u201cFP&A\u2019s role is to be an effective business partner,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s about using data to help executives make better decisions.\u201d\n\nEvan Goldstein Permission granted by Evan Goldstein\n\nThose decisions include everything from sales capacity modeling and deal structure analysis to headcount forecasting and pricing alignment. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with the CRO to structure deals, analyze sales capacity, model headcount and understand what\u2019s driving bookings growth,\u201d Goldstein said.\n\nStafford said the finance team\u2019s integration with sales has made them more than just gatekeepers. \u201cI sell to nobody more than [Goldstein],\u201d Stafford said. \u201cBut the way to \u2018sell\u2019 a CFO is not to just page in when you need something; that\u2019s the used car salesman mindset. The proper way is relationship selling, establishing trust and building a genuine relationship.\u201d\n\nUpgrading the finance tech stack also played a role in Seismic\u2019s journey to profitability. Goldstein said he implemented Workday Adaptive Planning to help cut forecast turnaround times and introduced Zip to overhaul procurement. \u201cProcurement was the function most on fire when I joined,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s seamless, and we\u2019ve seen strong ROI from day one.\u201d\n\nDeveloping alignment where it matters\n\nOne of the most impactful outcomes of the CFO-CRO relationship at Seismic has been a more disciplined approach to revenue operations. This includes commission planning for sales representatives whose deals involve deferred revenue recognition or extended payment terms, where commissions might otherwise be paid well before the company receives the cash. In order to develop this system, both executives say joint ownership is required.\n\nSeismic now uses a standardized commission model, with few exceptions agreed upon by both finance and sales leadership. \u201cCommissions can create a massive waterfall effect if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d Goldstein said.\n\nHayden Stafford Permission granted by Hayden Stafford\n\nThe system was designed collaboratively with sales leadership and built for field alignment and fiscal control. \u201cEvan came in with the law,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cBut [Goldstein] is not a \u2018no\u2019 CFO. He says no some of the time and yes some of the time. That\u2019s what a good, commercially oriented CFO is like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of the CFO and CRO as having two very different lenses,\u201d Stafford added. \u201cThe CFO\u2019s world can be black and white \u2014 profit, loss, make or miss the plan. The CRO\u2019s can be extremely dynamic and volatile. I\u2019m looking two quarters out. He\u2019s thinking three years out.\u201d\n\nThat difference in horizon often creates tension, but both say that tension is both necessary and productive. \u201cWe work hard to resolve issues quickly, keep each other informed and make sure the organization sees that we\u2019re rowing in the same direction,\u201d Goldstein said.\n\nEven during recent market pressure, the company preserved its President\u2019s Club and top-performer rewards, which Stafford said was evidence of Goldstein\u2019s commitment to rewarding sales representatives. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cut our top performers' club,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI never had to defend it. Evan was already and always behind it.\u201d\n\nBuilding for profitability and flexibility\n\nWhile much of Goldstein\u2019s work over the last three years has focused on financial infrastructure, the goal wasn\u2019t just to survive volatility; it was to build a company that could grow on its own terms. \u201cMy overarching goal is to create a durable growth company,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we build that, the outcome, whether it\u2019s going public, being acquired or taking additional investment, will take care of itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSales wants to close deals quickly and more resources in the field. Finance wants predictability, visibility and control. The truth is, you need both.\u201d Evan Goldstein CFO, Seismic\n\nSOX compliance is the last major hurdle before Seismic is IPO-ready, Goldstein said. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant investment of time and money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something you can complete in six to 12 months. If we decided to go this year, we could move on it.\u201d\n\nThe long-range planning process brings together Goldstein\u2019s finance and Stafford\u2019s revenue team and requires alignment on long-term strategy with near-term execution.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Seismic Nears $400M ARR, Profits Amid Strong CFO-CRO Alignment\n\n**Key details:**\nSeismic, a sales enablement software platform, is closing in on $400 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and has already achieved profitability. This milestone is attributed to the synchronized relationship between CFO Evan Goldstein and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) Hayden Stafford. Goldstein focused on rebuilding Seismic's finance organization to be a strategic partner, moving beyond an accounting-driven culture. They developed a disciplined approach to revenue operations, including a standardized commission model built collaboratively with sales leadership.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis development highlights a successful model for high-growth SaaS leadership built on collaboration, transparency, and shared ownership of growth and profitability. The strong CFO-CRO alignment enabled Seismic to reach profitability and build a \"durable growth company\" even during recent market pressure. This challenges a typical view by demonstrating how finance and sales can work in sync, with a \"commercially oriented CFO\" who supports sales incentives even when faced with market pressures. It suggests that integrating finance as a strategic partner, rather than just gatekeepers, drives better decisions and fiscal control.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSeismic provides sales enablement software to large go-to-market teams. CFO Evan Goldstein joined in 2022, focusing on creating \"structured chaos\" to support innovation while enforcing financial rigor. CRO Hayden Stafford, an enterprise sales veteran, joined around the same time. Goldstein's priorities included bringing in new leadership and integrating finance more deeply into go-to-market operations, supporting decisions like sales capacity modeling and deal structure analysis. He also upgraded the finance tech stack by implementing Workday Adaptive Planning and Zip.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Closing in on $400 million in annual recurring revenue.\n*   Already reached profitability.\n*   Evan Goldstein joined Seismic as CFO in 2022.\n*   SOX compliance, a hurdle before IPO, can be completed in six to 12 months.\n*   The team refreshes its three-year plan annually.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Seismic:** Sales enablement software platform nearing $400M ARR and reaching profitability.\n*   **Evan Goldstein:** CFO of Seismic, rebuilt finance, focused on strategic partnership and financial rigor.\n*   **Hayden Stafford:** CRO of Seismic, enterprise sales veteran, collaborating closely with finance for growth.\n*   **Genentech:** Prior employer of Evan Goldstein before he joined Seismic as CFO.\n*   **Salesforce:** Previous employer for both Evan Goldstein and Hayden Stafford before Seismic.\n*   **IBM:** Previous employer of Hayden Stafford before he joined Seismic as CRO.\n*   **Microsoft:** Previous employer of Hayden Stafford before he joined Seismic as CRO.\n*   **Workday Adaptive Planning:** Software implemented by Goldstein to cut forecast turnaround times.\n*   **Zip:** Software introduced by Goldstein to overhaul procurement processes.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   SOX compliance is the last major hurdle before Seismic is IPO-ready.\n*   This compliance can be completed in six to 12 months if they decide to go public this year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nStrong CFO-CRO alignment drives Seismic's profitability and durable growth, paving an IPO path.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Trial Balance is CFO.com\u2019s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare.\n\nPart 1 \u2014 Dunleavy mum on Alaska CPA licensure reform\n\nAlaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who had a long career in education before politics, allowed a major CPA licensure reform to become law without his signature.\n\nA former teacher, principal and school superintendent, Dunleavy declined to weigh in on a bill that creates a new 120-credit, two-year experience pathway for CPA candidates in Alaska beginning on Jan. 1, 2026. The move follows suit with a long list of states moving away from the 150-hour education rule that began in 1983. The legislation passed unanimously in both chambers of the Alaska Legislature and became law under state rules that don\u2019t require gubernatorial action for enactment.\n\nThe bill also permits businesses in Alaska to use out-of-state CPAs, but most attention has focused on the shift in licensure requirements. State Rep. and bill co-sponsor Calvin Schrage told local news outlets that the legislation stemmed from conversations with local business leaders looking for ways to strengthen the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nThe momentum for licensure reform has continued following the 2024 retirement of longtime AICPA president and CEO Barry Melancon, a vocal supporter of the 150-hour rule. Leaders at state CPA societies have called the timing coincidental, but Melancon\u2019s departure has nonetheless coincided with a wave of policy shifts that reflect growing interest in new pathways into the profession. In the ninth edition of the Uniform Accountancy Act released this summer, the AICPA itself has formally given approval to the new 120-hour pathway.\n\nPart 2 \u2014 This week\n\nHere\u2019s a list of important market events slated for the week ahead.\n\nMonday, Aug. 4\n\nFactory orders , June\n\nTuesday, Aug. 5\n\nWednesday, Aug. 6 \u2014 None scheduled.\n\nThursday, Aug. 7\n\n\n\nFriday, Aug. 8 \u2014 None scheduled.\n\nPart 3 \u2014 CFO media appearance of the week: Sandeep Aujla on Run the Numbers with CJ Gustafson\n\nIn his appearance on the Run the Numbers business podcast, Intuit CFO Sandeep Aujla described how large, established companies can maintain urgency and adaptability by being willing to \u201clet some stuff break.\u201d Aujla warned against organizational inertia, arguing that without a tolerance for internal disruption, \u201cthings just become so ingrained in the fabric of the organization that you will not be able to take it out.\u201d\n\nAujla walked through how Intuit approaches capital allocation by prioritizing a few strategic areas like AI, fintech infrastructure and the midmarket, while pushing the rest of the business to find efficiencies. \u201cWe have a lot of CFOs listening,\u201d Gustafson noted, asking how Aujla manages resource requests. Aujla responded that his role is to optimize for the company overall, not any one department. \u201cOnly two people in the company have that lens: the CEO and the CFO.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how finance tracks performance across Intuit\u2019s multiple business lines, Aujla said the company relies on 25 core \u201cgolden metrics\u201d focused on customer growth and platform adoption. He and the CEO review dashboards weekly and expect senior leaders to do the same. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have your own operating system,\u201d he said. \u201cMonday night, I\u2019m in the dashboards.\u201d",

About a quarter (23%) suffered financial losses.\n\nThe research, which studied data breaches experienced by 600 organizations globally from March 2024 through February 2025, was conducted by Ponemon Institute.\n\n\u201cThe data shows that a gap between AI adoption and oversight already exists, and threat actors are starting to exploit it,\u201d said Suja Viswesan, vice president of security and runtime products for IBM.\n\nThe average cost among all types of data breaches during the study period was $4.44 million, representing a 9% decrease from the prior 12-month period and a return to 2023 cost levels. Breach costs rose in the United States, though, to an average of $10.22 million from an average of $9.36 million.\n\nAccording to the report, driving the overall global cost decrease was faster identification and containment of breaches, \u201cmuch of it from organizations\u2019 own security and security service teams, with help from AI and automation.\u201d\n\nHowever, a majority (63%) of organizations that suffered an AI breach said they either didn\u2019t have an AI governance policy or were still developing one. Even where there was a policy, less than half (45%) had an approval process for AI deployments, and 61% lacked AI governance technologies, according to the report.\n\nThe threat posed by AI is not, of course, entirely related to lax internal governance and controls. The reported noted that one in six data breaches, or 16%, involved attackers using AI themselves, most often for AI-generated phishing (37%) and deepfake impersonation attacks (35%).\n\nAlmost a third (29%) of organizations that experienced a security incident involving an AI model or application reported that the source was a software-as-a-service product provided by a third-party vendor.\n\nAdditionally, 30% of such security incidents involved supply chains, including compromised apps, APIs and plug-ins.\n\nOne in five surveyed organizations said they experienced a security incident involving unsanctioned, \u201cshadow\u201d AI.

The IIA, whose members include nearly 200,000 certified internal auditors across 170 countries, sets internal audit standards, provides certifications and offers training and research opportunities for those working in internal audit.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, Cohen reflects on how audit quality has changed, the growing demands on internal audit teams and how members of her organization are thinking about the role of emerging technologies like agentic AI in the audit function.\n\nCohen also discusses what\u2019s kept her around for a decade, why strong internal audit relationships are critical and her perspective on issues shaping the profession \u2014 from the 150-hour CPA requirement to the skills and mindsets that define successful finance chiefs.\n\nAnn Cohen\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Ann Cohen\n\nCFO, Institute of Internal Auditors\n\nFirst CFO position: 2005\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nWoodfield Country Club\n\nBainbridge Companies\n\nTaylor Woodrow Developments\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nADAM ZAKI: Now that you\u2019re in your 10th year in the CFO seat at the IIA, what would you say has changed most about your role since you started?\n\nANN COHEN: Life as a CFO has just become so much more complex. The world has changed. Just look at the difference between the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic environments, for example. For my peers and me, factors like geopolitical risk, ESG expectations, new regulations and digital transformation have all added layers of complexity. And they\u2019re still evolving.\n\nAI is a great example. These emerging risks have made it a much more dynamic and difficult world to operate in. As a result, the audit process itself has become more complicated. We\u2019ve heard directly from our members, concerns such as \u2018Our auditors are struggling\u2019 or \u2018Why is this harder than it used to be?\u2019 The audit process itself is more difficult now.\n\nThe way audit has changed \u2014 how we work with people, how we access information, how we report \u2014 continues to evolve. To be effective, internal auditors now need to understand operations deeply. They need awareness of geopolitical factors, the ability to evaluate evolving risks and a strong grasp of internal controls. That level of insight takes work. It\u2019s a major challenge that makes what I do here really interesting.\n\nWhen you're developing global standards, how do you ensure they stay practical over time?\n\nWe stay close to our stakeholders \u2014 our National Institutes, global network, sponsors and regulators. We\u2019re constantly in listening mode: What\u2019s going on in your environment? What\u2019s shifting geopolitically? What risks are emerging in your region? Through advocacy and direct engagement, we keep a pulse on global developments. That helps us make sure our standards stay current and relevant.\n\nInternally, how does your audit oversight process work?\n\nWe have a chief audit executive who reports to our CEO, which is the standard structure in our profession. It\u2019s important they don\u2019t report to me as CFO because that could create a conflict; after all, they\u2019re auditing areas under my responsibility.\n\nThat said, we work very closely together. I see our internal audit leader as a strategic partner. We regularly collaborate on identifying risks, evaluating controls and improving our processes. She was actually in my office earlier today to talk about some IT-related topics. We\u2019re in constant contact.\n\nWhat do you think makes a healthy relationship between a CFO and their internal audit team?\n\nTransparency and trust are key. You have to be open and honest with one another. When the internal audit function identifies a finding, CFOs must ask questions \u2014 what they saw, how they found it, what their thinking was. But it\u2019s always from a place of curiosity, not defensiveness. That dynamic only works when both parties trust each other as true strategic partners.\n\nWhat is your role in developing the talent around your internal audit function?\n\nOur internal audit function works across the entire organization. So that means not just with me, but with our certification, membership and learning teams too. They provide insights into how operations are running, where control weaknesses might exist, and how risks are shifting. They also work closely with our risk manager to align on strategy. Everyone has their own strategic plan, and internal audit plays a critical role in helping us meet those goals.\n\nCan you provide details on how you and your members are talking about the role of agentic AI in audit?\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, there\u2019s definitely interest in using agentic AI. But right now, things are changing so fast. Everyone is trying to wrap their heads around what it means and how it will evolve. There\u2019s risk involved, like with all digital transformation, and the pace of change is dizzying.\n\nI read about it every day, and even then, it\u2019s hard to keep up. I can tell you that people are asking, \u2018When will this settle enough that we can implement it in a sustainable way? Where does it make sense for our organization? What will it cost?\u2019 Everyone wants to get there, but it\u2019s going to take time.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding the 150-hour CPA licensure requirement changes? Do you think it\u2019s lowering standards or removing an unnecessary boundary?\n\nThere are some valid points on both sides, but the changes' impact will likely not be as noticeable as if public accounting\u2019s other major issue were addressed.\n\nThe one piece we can\u2019t ignore is compensation. Aspiring CPAs need to be fairly compensated. When they graduate from college, they should be earning competitive salaries \u2014 comparable to other industries that may or may not require less schooling.\n\nWhether states keep or drop the 150-hour rule, we have to make accounting a competitive and attractive career path for all, and I think that conversation needs to be geared more towards compensation for those working in entry-level accounting positions.",

        "summary_text": "Microsoft delivered blockbuster, better-than-expected financial results on Wednesday, but a leaked internal memo from the company\u2019s finance chief signals that employees should not exactly rest easy.\n\nIn an internal memo obtained by Business Insider, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said that the company\u2019s next fiscal year will \u201crequire intensity, clarity and bold execution.\u201d\n\n\"We're entering FY26 with clear priorities in security, quality and AI transformation, building on our momentum and grounded in our mission and growth-mindset culture,\" Hood told employees, according to BI. \"Both the pace of change and customer expectations are continuously accelerating.\u201d\n\nHer message comes as the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant on Wednesday reported fourth quarter net income of $27 billion and achieved a market cap value surpassing $4 trillion, joining only Nvidia as the only other publicly traded company to hit that mark.\n\nStill, Microsoft execs maintain that the company\u2019s remarkable financial performance will come with some growing pains. Earlier this month, the company said it plans to reduce about 4% of its workforce, or about 9,000 people, the Seattle Times reported. That came after several other rounds of cuts in 2025.\n\nIn a message to employees last week, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella described the moves as part of the \u201cenigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd yet, at the same time, we\u2019ve undergone layoffs.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the layoffs certainly may raise eyebrows. It also carries reputational risks of its own. Rita McGrath, executive director of executive education at Columbia University, said that such moves are a \u201csymbolic disconnect of a massive degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat definitely could damage the culture,\u201d she said in an interview with CFO.com.\n\nThe wider tech industry\u2019s reported layoffs likely stem from a \u201creal arms race in the AI world,\u201d McGrath said. Tech businesses are also under pressure to show that their enormous investments in artificial intelligence tools are justified. Microsoft, for its part, plans to spend over $30 billion on total capex this quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s incumbent on CFOs, McGrath said, to explain to analysts and the wider business community the clear reasoning behind any strategic shifts. As an example, she pointed back to Adobe\u2019s switch from selling software on physical CDs to selling it through cloud subscriptions. Though the company\u2019s revenue dipped at the time, its market valuation grew, McGrath said. She attributed that to efforts the company\u2019s CFO made to explain the shift.\n\nFor now, though, analysts are still apparently betting high on Microsoft\u2019s \u201cAI transformation,\u201d as CFO Hood put it in her memo. In a research note, Raymond James analysts said that Microsoft had an \u201cunusually strong quarter with hardly anything to complain about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Azure stole the show, the strong performance was pervasive throughout the company\u2019s print,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSegment results, expense trends, and guidance were all excellent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, despite job cuts, Microsoft\u2019s total workforce has been ticking up within the last few fiscal years. According to annual securities filings, Microsoft employed 228,000 people worldwide as of June 30. The tech giant reported the exact same number in the prior year. As of June 2022, Microsoft said it employed 221,000 employees, up from 181,000 employees in the prior year.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBrian Kassalen is a principal and the construction industry leader with Baker Tilly, a Chicago-based advisory, tax and assurance firm. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nAs inflation, labor and tariffs continue to pressure the construction industry, contractors are looking for opportunities to protect profit margins. Artificial intelligence offers builders new ways to remain competitive and profitable before projects even start.\n\nProject estimates and AI\n\nConstruction is an industry where most of the work is awarded to low-bid contracts, so any tool that helps a contractor\u2019s success on project estimation through project completion is extremely valuable. That\u2019s where AI comes in.\n\nAI can significantly improve the accuracy of bid development by using algorithms to estimate potential costs based on data gathered from a wide range of sources \u2014 past bids, supply chain databases, market data and publicly available contract records.\n\nBrian Kassalen Permission granted by Baker Tilly\n\nWhen prompted correctly, AI reduces the risk of human error and accelerates the estimation process, and analyzes key pricing and project variables in seconds instead of days.\n\nThe right data\n\nWhile AI\u2019s role in construction is relatively new to construction contract creation, a phrase dating back to the early days of computing remains true: \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s critical for contractors to understand that the quality of the data that AI uses determines the usefulness of its output. If the data is flawed, inaccurate or biased, AI\u2019s output will also be flawed or incomplete.\n\nFor example, if a contractor is developing a competitive bid for a construction project, they typically consider the cost of raw materials, subcontractors, labor and equipment and could spend days \u2014 even weeks \u2014 reviewing documents and manually compiling information. These sources of data could be from within the company itself or external.\n\nAI can also use design data directly from building information modeling platforms. Instead of relying on static spreadsheets or manual quantity takeoffs, AI systems can read BIM models to identify specific materials, quantities and construction elements, then apply intelligent cost-mapping to each unit. This integration lets estimators adjust pricing in real time as design changes occur, supporting more flexible and responsive budgeting.\n\nAI doesn't replace BIM \u2014 it works alongside it, turning raw model data into actionable, cost-specific insights during the design and preconstruction phases.\n\nThat level of precision becomes especially important once a contractor's bid is accepted and pricing is locked in, unless change orders are approved. If an estimate is off, it can shrink profit margins or turn the project into a financial loss.\n\nBy using predictive analytics, AI can flag and quantify potential risks early, including market volatility, labor shortages or scope gaps. These insights can be built into unit cost estimates to create more resilient bids and help avoid costly surprises down the line.\n\nNegotiation\n\nAI can also be used in negotiation, especially for addressing potential issues proactively, allowing justification for particular mark-ups in a contract. In addition, if unforeseen changes cause delays or additional costs after the contract is signed, AI may be helpful in finding common ground between two negotiating parties.\n\nFor example, instead of submitting incomplete or delayed change orders, contractors can use AI to produce faster, data-driven justifications for both scope and cost adjustments. This can lead to more timely approvals from project owners and reduce disputes during final cost reconciliation.\n\nWith better data upfront, contractors are less likely to face disagreements later over what the change was worth.\n\nSecurity\n\nContractors also need to be cognizant of privacy and security when using AI to develop bids. A closed, proprietary AI system can help prevent external disclosure of estimates, bids and sensitive information.\n\nOn the other hand, if contractors use open-source AI to develop bids, they risk exposing this information to the competition, losing user trust and potentially violating data protection regulations.\n\nAt a minimum, contractors need to evaluate their hardware, software, licenses and security controls to ensure a safe environment for AI deployment and use.\n\nWhere to begin\n\nWith the industry changing so quickly, many contractors are at a loss where to start their AI integration journey. Some companies are \u201call-in,\u201d while others are in a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach.\n\nFor those contractors on the fence, the first step is to recognize the need for change and begin to have exploratory conversations about how AI can be integrated into the bidding process and other aspects of construction. A third party that is experienced in AI integration can help a contractor develop an AI strategy to help with the bidding and negotiation process.\n\nAs with all AI, human oversight will remain necessary in the bidding and negotiation process. The technology may save thousands of manual work hours and improve accuracy, allowing the workforce to use their time on more strategic tasks.\n\nContractors also need to recognize that AI integration into construction bidding is more than a one-time event. By its very nature, the use of AI by contractors is still evolving.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThough some builders are experiencing a slowdown, Jacobs is taking advantage of high-growth construction sectors, according to its fiscal third quarter earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dallas-based contractor cited strong demand across advanced facilities and consulting services, especially in the data center construction sector.\n\n\u201cThe number of inquiries, as well as engagement we have, have grown substantially,\u201d said CEO Bob Pragada during the call. \u201c[It\u2019s] the highest that they\u2019ve been this quarter.\u201d\n\nPragada highlighted a new partnership with Nvidia, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker, to create digital twins for artificial intelligence data centers. The move could serve as a global design reference for the chipmaker\u2019s customers, he said.\n\nJacobs will test and enhance the end-to-end blueprint workflow and enable accurate simulations of facility equipment. Through this collaboration, engineering teams can design, simulate and optimize factories within physically accurate virtual environments, according to a May 19 company news release.\n\nBob Pragada Courtesy of Jacobs\n\n\u201cThis opportunity with Nvidia is pretty transformational,\u201d said Pragada. \u201cThis will be the plan of record that Nvidia will give to their customer base using the Nvidia chip, which we\u2019re already getting inquiries from those customers back into Jacobs. We\u2019re excited.\u201d\n\nHe also noted Jacobs\u2019 recent award from a confidential client to help convert a legacy manufacturing site in the Southeast United States into a high-performance data center, part of a broader trend toward vertically integrated facilities.\n\n\u201cWe captured meaningful scope on this program by leveraging our cross-sector capability,\u201d said Pragada. \u201cAnd we are seeing more and more opportunities like this in the market.\u201d\n\nLife sciences and water projects also continue to drive momentum in Jacobs\u2019 portfolio. The Dallas-based construction company highlighted water projects, for example, as one of its most resilient and high-growth markets.\n\nThe firm recently won additional work at the Little Miami Wastewater Treatment facility in Cincinnati and expects more long-cycle projects to come online in 2026. Meanwhile, PA Consulting, Jacobs\u2019 strategy and management consulting division, posted 15% revenue growth during the quarter, according to the earnings report.\n\nPragada expects the strong performance to repeat next quarter despite effects from political uncertainty on the overall construction sector in recent months. He also noted the firm has started to see infrastructure activity in Europe pick up again as government budgets stabilize.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing sector growth drivers in life sciences, semiconductor, data center, energy and power and water sectors that have resulted in continued upward trends in spending across our business,\u201d said Pragada during the call. \u201cWe continue to manage well through an uncertain economic backdrop.\u201d\n\nPragada called the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill a net positive for the company\u2019s portfolio, despite some state-level spending cuts. He added that only about a third of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds have been spent, and that disbursements should continue well into fiscal year 2026.\n\nQ3 results\n\nJacobs reported $179.61 million in profit for its fiscal third quarter, about a 22.2% increase compared to $146.93 million in the same period a year ago. Revenue for the quarter climbed to $3.03 billion, about a 5.1% jump from $2.88 billion last year.\n\nBacklog jumped to $22.69 billion, about a 14.3% gain from $19.86 billion in fiscal third quarter 2024, according to the earnings report.\n\nAnalysts praised the results, largely due to strong momentum across key sectors.\n\n\u201cJacobs reported a solid quarter, underpinned by disciplined cost controls and healthy growth in both its infrastructure and advanced facilities and PA Consulting segments,\u201d wrote Faisal Hersi, equity analyst with financial services firm Edward Jones in a research note. \u201cWe see healthy momentum across key areas of Jacobs\u2019 business, including life science, water and data centers, which should drive further growth.\u201d",

Kiewit warned the delay could lead to increased costs and a longer project timeline, according to a letter obtained by 3NEWS.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFour council members sent a letter to the Texas Water Development Board that asked whether state funding earmarked for the Inner Harbor site could be redirected to other water projects if the city ultimately walks away, KRIS 6 News reported. It also sought clarity on loan repayment terms and the availability of additional grant funding.\n\nDuring the July 29 meeting, council member Eric Cantu introduced a motion to pause the project for 30 days in order to give the state time to respond. The delay comes amid growing calls to explore alternatives to the project, even though the city has spent almost $100 million on it to date, according to KRIS 6 News. If the plant advances as planned, it is scheduled to come online in 2028.\n\nDesalination is growing in popularity amid worsening water scarcity, but it remains a less common treatment method. Processing saltwater for drinking water is relatively costly and requires significant energy, and the process disturbs the environment both when the plant takes in water and when it discharges brine, according to E&E News.\n\nHowever, bolstering the city\u2019s water supply is an urgent issue. Corpus Christi is currently in a Stage 3 drought, meaning most outdoor water use is restricted, per the city\u2019s water agency.\n\nTexas as a whole is dealing with leaky pipes and old treatment plants stressed by a dwindling water supply, growing demand and persistent droughts. Soon voters in the state will decide on a measure that would dedicate $1 billion annually for 20 years to address aging water infrastructure, conservation and new water supplies.",

This directly challenges the previous commitment to the chosen contractor and desalination method, introducing uncertainty for future large-scale municipal projects. The city's active exploration of alternatives suggests a potential shift away from this costly solution, impacting the outlook for similar water infrastructure initiatives. For investors, this signals heightened risk for companies involved in large, publicly funded projects susceptible to cost overruns and political scrutiny. It also questions the long-term certainty of desalination projects as a consensus solution for water scarcity, given its high cost and environmental impacts highlighted in the article.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCorpus Christi faces an urgent need to secure its water supply, currently experiencing a Stage 3 drought with restricted outdoor water use. The Inner Harbor plant was designed to provide a drought-proof water supply for the city's growing population. While desalination is gaining popularity amid worsening water scarcity, the article notes it remains a less common, costly, energy-intensive, and environmentally disruptive treatment method. Across Texas, aging water infrastructure, dwindling supply, and persistent droughts are significant concerns. Texas voters will soon consider a measure to dedicate $1 billion annually for 20 years to address water infrastructure, conservation, and new supplies statewide.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$1.189 billion:** Current projected cost of the desalination plant.\n*   **$750 million:** Original projected cost for the plant in October 2024.\n*   **Almost $100 million:** Amount already spent on the project to date.\n*   **$50 million:** Contract amendment amount the city council was set to vote on.\n*   **2028:** Original scheduled online date for the plant.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Corpus Christi, Texas:** City whose council members voted to pause work on the $1.189 billion desalination plant.\n*   **Kiewit Infrastructure South Co.:** Company selected to design and build the plant, warned of increased costs and longer timelines.\n*   **Texas Water Development Board:** State entity contacted by council members regarding redirecting earmarked state funding.\n*   **Eric Cantu:** City council member who introduced the motion to pause the project for 30 days.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Corpus Christi city council plans to revisit the desalination plant project on August 26.\n*   Texas voters will soon decide on a measure to dedicate $1 billion annually for 20 years to water infrastructure.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCorpus Christi water plant pause signals major project reevaluation, cost uncertainty.",

Dominion estimates that the new tariffs will make the project more expensive by $506 million, increasing the total cost of the project to $10.9 billion. The added expenses will increase customer bills by an average of three cents a month over the entire life of the project, said Bob Blue, Dominion\u2019s president, CEO and chairman.\n\nThe utility has slightly lowered its expectations for tariff-related price increases since last quarter \u201cdespite a doubling of the steel tariff,\u201d Blue said, \u201cdue to both working with vendors to identify cost mitigation strategies as well as completing our analysis of the final trade regulations and appendices.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBlue said that the proposed tariff increases for Mexico and the European Union would add an additional $134 million to the project\u2019s costs.\n\n\u201cThe project fabrication and installation are going very well, and CVOW continues to be one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will install our first turbine in September, which is in line with our original schedule \u2026 In fact, we're well ahead of plan, installing monopiles at a pace that exceeds any other U.S. offshore wind project to date.\u201d\n\nBlue said the project has installed 134 of its 176 monopiles, or 76%, and all of its pin piles.\n\nThe utility\u2019s anticipated completion of Charybdis, the first Jones Act-compliant offshore wind turbine installation vessel in the U.S., was delayed by work on the vessel\u2019s internal communication technology.\n\n\u201cWe had expected the vessel to complete sea trials last month, which would have enabled us to begin turbine installation ahead of schedule,\u201d Blue said. Charybdis \u201celiminates the need for barges, which will be instrumental in helping us stay on track with turbine installation,\u201d and will cost $715 million as originally estimated, he said.\n\nBlue also said the utility is \u201cquite pleased\u201d with the ultimate shape of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which significantly reduced and curtailed many of the IRA\u2019s renewable energy tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe're confident we can preserve all of the credits that we've provided in our forecast to investors, either through safe harboring or under long-standing rules,\u201d he said. Dominion doesn\u2019t expect CVOW or many of its other projects to be impacted.\n\nOnly about 20% to 25% of the utility\u2019s clean energy projects will \u201crequire some active mitigation,\u201d Blue said. \u201cAnd as I mentioned, we expect to be able to achieve that and have plans to do that.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Dominion's Offshore Wind Project Faces Tariff Hike, Stays On Schedule\n\n**Key details:**\nDominion Energy's 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2026 and expects to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. However, the project's total cost is now estimated at $10.9 billion, an increase of $506 million due to new tariff policies, which will raise customer bills by three cents a month. Despite a doubled steel tariff, the company has lowered its tariff-related price increase expectations through vendor work and regulation analysis. The Jones Act-compliant vessel Charybdis experienced delays due to internal communication technology issues.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe projected cost increase due to tariffs directly impacts the project's financial outlay and customer affordability, requiring the utility to manage financial expectations. Despite these added expenses, Dominion's confidence in preserving all forecast IRA tax credits suggests a stable outlook for investor returns on clean energy projects. The project's continued adherence to its original installation schedule, including turbine deployment in September, demonstrates operational resilience. This information might challenge a consensus view that new tariff policies would severely disrupt major renewable energy project timelines or fully negate their intended tax credit benefits.\n\n**The big picture:**\nDominion Energy is advancing a major 2.6-GW offshore wind project critical for clean energy supply. The project's economics are significantly influenced by evolving governmental policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits and new tariff policies. Dominion's strategy involves proactive engagement with vendors and a thorough analysis of trade regulations to mitigate financial impacts. The successful deployment of specialized vessels like Charybdis is crucial for maintaining the project's installation pace and overall timeline.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2.6-GW:** Capacity of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.\n*   **End of 2026:** Expected completion date for the project.\n*   **$506 million:** Expected increase in project cost due to new tariffs.\n*   **$10.9 billion:** New total estimated cost of the project.\n*   **Three cents:** Average monthly increase in customer bills due to added expenses.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Dominion Energy:** Utility developing offshore wind project, managing costs, schedules, and tax credits.\n*   **Bob Blue:** Dominion's CEO and chairman, providing updates on project costs and progress.\n*   **President Trump:** Implemented new tariff policies causing increased project costs for Dominion Energy.\n*   **Mexico:** Proposed tariffs from this country would add $134 million to project costs.\n*   **European Union:** Proposed tariffs from this bloc would add $134 million to project costs.\n*   **Charybdis:** First Jones Act-compliant offshore wind installation vessel, delayed by tech issues.\n*   **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA):** Legislation providing tax credits for renewable energy projects like CVOW.\n*   **One Big Beautiful Bill Act:** Legislation that significantly reduced many IRA renewable energy tax credits.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Installation of the first turbine is expected in September.\n*   Completion of Charybdis, the Jones Act-compliant vessel, is anticipated following internal communication technology resolution.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTariffs hike wind project costs, but Dominion maintains schedule and tax credit outlook.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The U.S. government is still pushing agencies to adopt zero-trust network designs, continuing a project that gained steam during the Biden administration, a senior cybersecurity policy official said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt must continue to move forward,\u201d Michael Duffy, the acting federal chief information security officer, said during a panel at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference. \u201cThat architectural side of it is very important for us to get right as we integrate new technologies [like] artificial intelligence into the ways we operate.\u201d\n\nZero-trust networking emphasizes the concept of throwing up hurdles to hackers who penetrate a computer system, limiting the damage they can do by sealing off parts of the network and requiring strict user authentication.\n\nThe Biden administration in early 2022 required agencies to adopt zero-trust architectures on their networks. The Biden White House\u2019s timeline \u201chas since lapsed,\u201d Duffy said, but \u201cthe foundational expectations remain, and they will continue to remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe roadmaps at federal agencies are in place,\u201d Duffy added. \u201cA lot of that work is architectural in nature.\u201d\n\nThe comments from a top Trump administration cybersecurity official \u2014 albeit one serving in an interim role \u2014 suggest that the new administration sees value in some of its predecessors\u2019 cyber priorities.\n\nNow that agencies are several years into adopting zero-trust principles, Duffy said, the next big push from the government will be about \u201cshowing and demonstrating that zero trust is a way of thinking, a way of architecting, a way of operating that has to be available for all of us \u2026 because of the threats that we\u2019re seeing from AI and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that that blast radius [of an attack] is as narrow as possible,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause our time to respond is increasingly narrow.\u201d\n\nDuffy\u2019s team inside the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget has been encouraging federal agencies to prioritize the adoption of technologies that can speed up their ability to spot cyberattacks. Duffy said he pays close attention to calculations of how long it takes defenders to detect, respond to and mitigate intrusions. Those \u201care important measures for us to take in and consider when we\u2019re making policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that shows us that we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n\nDuffy spoke on the panel alongside Chris Butera, the acting head of the Cybersecurity Division at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In addition to overseeing CISA\u2019s work assisting the rest of the government with cyber defense, Butera helps protect the agency\u2019s own computer systems, and he said Wednesday that CISA\u2019s own zero-trust journey illustrates some of the difficulties of making major changes to an enterprise\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to grade an entire organization against zero trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have various systems in various states of modernization, different identity management and access management solutions.\u201d\n\nAs it modernized its networks, Butera said, CISA asked itself, \u201cAre we getting the right telemetry, are we using our tools effectively, and do we have the right relationships with our vendor community to actually understand how we can best utilize their [products]?\u201d\n\nSuccessfully migrating a network to zero-trust architecture also requires broadly communicating the value of the changes, which can at times be disruptive to network users, according Butera.\n\n\u201cYou have to explain zero trust across your whole community,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everyone wakes up and says, \u2018I love doing cyber everyday. I love doing IT everyday.\u2019 That\u2019s not the world we live in.\u201d\n\nRead more news from Black Hat USA 2025 here.",

Joyce noted that in a normal government transition, you lose a lot of leadership.\n\n\u201cThis year, [we] didn\u2019t just lose the top leaders of government; we lost operational capability at any number of departments and agencies.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration launched a massive effort to slash jobs at key federal agencies, including CISA, which helps protect critical infrastructure providers and federal civilian agencies from cyber threats.\n\nSenior officials at CISA, the NSA and other agencies either resigned, took buyout offers or were fired as part of a downsizing program intended to slash federal spending and, in some cases, install officials more closely aligned with the new administration\u2019s policy priorities.\n\nJoyce noted that the vast majority of critical infrastructure in the U.S. is owned by the private sector, which means the federal government is dependent on industry to share insights about their security concerns as well as inform authorities of immediate threats.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has played an increasing role in sharing vital threat data as the NSA and other agencies increasingly work with private organizations. But Joyce said that intelligence is of little value if defenders can\u2019t operationalize it in a non-classified setting so that a broad swath of organizations can defend themselves accordingly.\n\nJPMorgan Chase chief information security officer Pat Opet said there was a need to establish strong relationships when administrations changed hands or when companies found themselves working with a new set of government leaders.\n\n\u201cIn terms of how we scale, the effort today is still very much based on trust,\u201d Opet said.\n\nThe financial industry is subject to much stricter cyber regulations than other sectors, but it also receives significant value from specialized threat intelligence, Opet said. The Treasury Department has a program called T-Suite, which involves sharing critical information through its Office of Intelligence and Analysis.\n\nMarci McCarthy, the recently appointed director of public affairs at CISA, defended the administration\u2019s efforts to work with the private sector. McCarthy said the agency under Trump was refocusing on its core mission.\n\nMcCarthy pointed to $100 million in grant funding that CISA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are offering to help support state, local and tribal communities. (That money, however, cannot be spent on a key source of cybersecurity support for local governments.)\n\nCISA has worked closely with a number of industry partners on sharing threat information and providing guidance to security teams, according to McCarthy.\n\nAmong some of the more recent efforts, CISA collaborated with industry partners and other agencies during the Microsoft SharePoint exploitation campaign in July, McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cImmediately, because of that public-private collaboration and trust, we went to Microsoft [and] made them aware of the situation,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCarthy also referenced the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, noting that it was stuck in Congress. The law, set to expire at the end of September, provides liability protections for organizations that share cyber-threat information with each other and with government agencies. McCarthy said CISA hopes to see the act reauthorized without changes.\n\nRead more news from Black Hat USA 2025 here.",

This follows significant upheaval and job cuts at agencies like CISA under the Trump administration, which reduced government operational capability. Panelists largely agreed that the federal government relies on private industry to share critical cyber threat information.\n\n**Why it matters:** Effective collaboration between government and private industry is essential to combat sophisticated cyber adversaries. The erosion of trust and loss of government operational capacity significantly impedes the ability to respond to identified threats. This situation challenges the presumed robust government-private sector cybersecurity posture, potentially increasing cyber risk for critical infrastructure and private companies. The financial industry, despite strict regulations, relies heavily on specialized threat intelligence.\n\n**The big picture:** The U.S. remains under a heightened cyber threat. The federal government is dependent on private industry to share security insights and immediate threats, as the private sector owns the vast majority of U.S. critical infrastructure.

This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty and global market volatility. As a share of overall information technology budgets, cybersecurity spending also decreased from 11.9% to 10.9%, breaking a five-year upward trend. This indicates that security budgets are not immune to broader macroeconomic conditions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information challenges the potential consensus view that cybersecurity spending is perpetually robust and recession-proof due to rising threats. Despite cyber being a top business risk, many Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are not receiving budget increases commensurate with their program scope. The data suggests that even mission-critical areas like cybersecurity can face stagnant or reduced budgets, impacting companies' ability to manage risk effectively.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCFO confidence plummeted in the second quarter of the year, driven by economic headwinds and geopolitical concerns. The economy was the top external risk for CFOs, closely followed by cybersecurity.

        "summary_text": "SonicWall said Monday that it is investigating whether a recent surge in attacks targeting its Gen 7 firewalls is related to a possible zero-day vulnerability or exploitation of an existing flaw.\n\nThe warnings follow an Aug. 1 Arctic Wolf report about hackers deploying the Akira ransomware variant in attacks that began on July 15.\n\nResearchers saw an uptick in hands-on-keyboard activity last week and warned that the attacks were targeting fully patched devices after their users had rotated credentials.\n\nSonicWall said the current attacks are similar to a series of hacks last year involving an improper access control vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-40766.\n\nResearchers at Huntress said on Monday that the activity \u2014 which involves hackers bypassing multifactor authentication and deploying ransomware \u2014 likely reflects the existence of a zero-day vulnerability. Huntress has observed approximately 20 such attacks since July 25.\n\nJohn Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, said researchers have moderate to high confidence of a zero-day linkage, as the breadth of activity appears to narrow the options of what this could be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t have the bottom line, the root cause analysis down quite yet,\u201d Hammond told Cybersecurity Dive, \u201cBut seeing something like brute force credentials or some MFA bypass as widely as this doesn\u2019t seem to be the right answer.\u201d\n\nThe compromises may be limited to SonicWall\u2019s TZ and Nsa firewalls with SSLVPN enabled, according to Huntress. In addition, researchers said the vulnerability involves versions 7.2.0-7015 and earlier.\n\nSophos reports it has picked up 10 incidents either through managed detection and response software or incident response, since July 23, according to Alexandra Rose, director of threat research, Sophos Counter Threat Unit.\n\n\u201cWhile our current observations are primarily from U.S.-based organizations, this does not indicate that the U.S. is the only region affected,\u201d Rose said.\n\nSonicWall is urging customers to disable SSLVPN services when it is practical to do so and otherwise limit SSL VPN to trusted sources.

Researchers noted an uptick in hands-on-keyboard activity last week, targeting fully patched devices even after users rotated credentials. Huntress observed approximately 20 such attacks since July 25, reporting hackers are bypassing multifactor authentication and deploying ransomware. These compromises may be limited to TZ and Nsa firewalls with SSLVPN enabled, specifically versions 7.2.0-7015 and earlier. Sophos has also identified 10 incidents since July 23.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhy it matters: The potential for a zero-day vulnerability in SonicWall's current generation firewalls is significant, especially as attacks affect \"fully patched devices.\" This challenges the consensus view that regular patching and credential rotation alone provide sufficient security. Furthermore, hackers bypassing multifactor authentication, a cornerstone of modern security, could erode confidence in these protective measures. The deployment of ransomware and urgent customer advisories from SonicWall highlight the severe financial and operational risks posed to affected organizations.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe big picture: SonicWall's investigation follows an August 1 Arctic Wolf report detailing Akira ransomware attacks that began July 15. The current attacks share similarities with previous hacks last year involving an improper access control vulnerability. SonicWall devices have faced several attack campaigns recently, including a mid-July warning from Google researchers about a threat actor targeting end-of-life SMA 100 appliances. SonicWall is urging customers to disable SSLVPN services where practical and enforce other security measures.\n\n**By the numbers:**\nBy the numbers:\n*   Aug. 1: Arctic Wolf report date regarding Akira ransomware.\n*   July 15: Date Akira ransomware attacks began.\n*   ~20: Attacks observed by Huntress since July 25.\n*   July 25: Date Huntress observed activity.\n*   7.2.0-7015: Vulnerable SonicWall versions and earlier.\n*   10: Incidents picked up by Sophos since July 23.\n*   CVE-2024-40766: Vulnerability tracked last year, similar to current attacks.\n\n**Key Players:**\nKey Players:\n*   **SonicWall:** Investigating a surge in attacks on its Gen 7 firewalls and potential zero-day vulnerability.\n*   **Arctic Wolf:** Reported on hackers deploying Akira ransomware variant in attacks since mid-July.\n*   **Huntress:** Researchers who observed attacks, believing they likely reflect a zero-day vulnerability.\n*   **John Hammond:** Principal security researcher at Huntress, expressed moderate to high confidence in zero-day linkage.\n*   **Sophos:** Reports picking up 10 incidents through its managed detection or incident response software.\n*   **Alexandra Rose:** Director of threat research at Sophos, commented on current U.S.-based observations.\n*   **Google:** Researchers warned in mid-July about a threat actor targeting end-of-life SonicWall SMA 100 appliances.\n*   **UNC6148:** Threat actor tracked by Google researchers, targeting SonicWall appliances.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nLooking Forward:\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe Bottom Line: SonicWall faces potential zero-day, challenging security for patched, MFA-protected systems.",

Another group, which CrowdStrike called \u201cReconnaissance Spider,\u201d almost certainly used AI to translate one of its phishing lures into Ukrainian when it reused old messages after their initial deployment. The attackers forgot to remove the AI model\u2019s boilerplate prompt-response sentence from the text they copied.\n\nAI is also helping the North Korea-linked hacker team \u201cFamous Chollima\u201d (also tracked as UNC5267) sustain \u201can exceptionally high operational tempo\u201d of more than 320 intrusions in a year, the report said. The group is known for masterminding North Korea\u2019s remote IT-worker fraud schemes, which funnel stolen money to Pyongyang and sometimes lead to the theft of victim businesses\u2019 confidential data.\n\nThe hackers have been able to \u201csustain this pace by interweaving GenAI-powered tools that automate and optimize workflows at every stage of the hiring and employment process,\u201d CrowdStrike said.

Cybercriminals are also leveraging AI to automate tasks and improve their tools. Hackers utilize AI to understand targets, bypass social and technical barriers, and sustain high operational tempos. Moreover, AI tools themselves are becoming a top target for hackers as companies often forget to secure them.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe increasing use of AI by hackers means the cyberattack surface for organizations will continue expanding. Trusted AI tools are emerging as a new insider threat, posing significant security challenges. This development challenges the consensus that AI adoption solely benefits businesses, as it simultaneously creates new, exploitable vulnerabilities.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Senate late Saturday confirmed Sean Cairncross, a veteran Republican political operative with close ties to the Trump administration, to become the country\u2019s third national cyber director, setting up a test of how tightly the president\u2019s advisers will try to control cybersecurity policy from the White House.\n\nCairncross, a former chief operating officer and legal adviser at the Republican National Committee, served as the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation during Trump\u2019s first term. He does not have significant technology or cybersecurity expertise, although he told senators during his confirmation hearing that he had helped public and private organizations respond to cyberattacks. As head of the relatively new Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), he will have a significant opportunity to put his stamp on how the Trump administration approaches a wide range of cyber challenges.\n\nSenators voted 59-35 to confirm him.\n\n\u201cAs the cyber strategic environment continues to evolve, we must ensure our policy efforts and capabilities deliver results for our national security and the American people,\u201d Cairncross said in a statement shared by his new office. \u201cThe United States must dominate the cyber domain through strong collaboration across departments and agencies, as well as private industry. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will enter a new era of effective cybersecurity policy.\u201d\n\nCongress created ONCD in 2021 to serve as the president's chief adviser on cyber defense issues. During the Biden administration, the office led projects on growing the cyber workforce, improving open-source software security, protecting vulnerable critical infrastructure communities like K-12 schools, securing new energy technology, and streamlining cyber regulations. It also promoted closer government ties with security researchers, encouraged infrastructure projects to prioritize cybersecurity and championed work to secure space systems, internet routing technology and post-quantum cryptography.\n\nCairncross will have to decide which, if any, of those projects to continue and which new ones to launch. He has said little about where he will focus his office\u2019s attention, although he is likely to prioritize regulatory harmonization, given Republicans\u2019 complaints \u2014 echoed by the business community \u2014 that there are too many overlapping cyber rules. At his confirmation hearing, Cairncross promised to meet regularly with industry executives to understand how the government could help them.\n\nONCD\u2019s workforce grew steadily during the Biden administration as its leaders tried to make it an authoritative voice on cyber matters within the government. But tensions between the office and the National Security Council (NSC) limited ONCD\u2019s influence and even led to the resignation of the first national cyber director. Under Cairncross, the office could staff up again and push for greater authority.\n\nHacking back\n\nCairncross\u2019s most emphatic comments on cybersecurity have involved offensive cyber operations, a topic that is outside of ONCD\u2019s portfolio. At his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly argued that the U.S. could stem a growing tide of cyberattacks by hacking its adversaries to put them on notice. His focus on offensive activities represents a sharp departure from the vision of his Biden-era predecessors. But Cairncross\u2019s views are likely to win him allies on Trump\u2019s NSC cyber team, which is stocked with proponents of hacking back. Those relationships could help Cairncross avoid bureaucratic tensions and raise ONCD\u2019s profile within the administration and in the public eye.\n\nWarm reception\n\nLeading national security experts have praised Cairncross for his management experience, relationship-building acumen and ability to \u201crespond to rapidly evolving political dynamics shaping policy conversations at the highest levels of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSean\u2019s leadership, experience, and commitment to public service will be vital to [ONCD\u2019s] growth into the center of gravity for cyber strategy, planning, coordination, and response,\u201d Frank Cilluffo, director of Auburn University\u2019s McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, said in a statement after Cairncross\u2019s confirmation.\n\nJason Oxman, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a leading tech trade group, encouraged Cairncross to \u201cfocus on a strategic, coordinated approach to U.S. cyber policy\u201d and to push for the reauthorization of the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.",

Although he lacks significant technology or cybersecurity expertise, he will lead the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). Cairncross stated his aim to enter a \"new era of effective cybersecurity policy\" under President Trump, emphasizing strong collaboration across government and private industry.\n\n**Why it matters:** Cairncross's confirmation signals a potential shift in U.S. cybersecurity policy, departing from the previous administration's focus. His stated emphasis on offensive cyber operations, though outside ONCD\u2019s traditional portfolio, marks a sharp departure from Biden-era predecessors. This could challenge the prevailing consensus on U.S. cyber strategy by pushing for a more aggressive, \"hacking back\" approach.

Hackers used 4L4MD4R ransomware to encrypt files, leaving a note demanding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The attackers disabled Windows Defender real-time monitoring and bypassed certificate validation. This marks a new dimension to the ongoing SharePoint attack campaign. Palo Alto Networks suggests this ransomware activity is unrelated to nation-state threats.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis ransomware attempt signals a worrisome escalation in the exploitation of SharePoint vulnerabilities, adding a direct financial extortion component. Crucially, Palo Alto Networks' finding that this attack appears unrelated to nation-state activity challenges prior warnings about China-backed hackers. This shift suggests a broader risk from opportunistic actors, expanding the threat landscape for organizations using widely adopted enterprise software like SharePoint. Investors should note the evolving nature of threats impacting prevalent technology.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe attack exploits recently disclosed ToolShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint, specifically CVE-2025-53770, which hackers have been exploiting for weeks. In July, at least 300 known compromises related to these vulnerabilities occurred worldwide, including U.S. government agencies. Shadowserver reported 17,000 exposed SharePoint instances online, with 840 still critically vulnerable. Many of these vulnerable servers contained webshells, indicating hacker presence. Researchers previously warned of both nation-state interest and opportunistic attacks targeting vulnerable SharePoint.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   17,000 SharePoint instances: Reported by Shadowserver as exposed on the internet.\n*   840 instances: Still contained critical vulnerability CVE-2025-53770.\n*   20 vulnerable servers: Found to contain webshells by Shadowserver.\n*   300 known compromises: Documented worldwide by July, including U.S. government agencies.\n*   4L4MD4R: Name of the ransomware used in the attack.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Palo Alto Networks:** Security company investigating a ransomware attack linked to SharePoint vulnerabilities.\n*   **Microsoft SharePoint:** Software platform affected by ToolShell vulnerabilities leading to ransomware attacks.\n*   **Andy Piazza:** Senior director at Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42, quoted regarding the ransomware details.\n*   **Shadowserver:** Reported thousands of exposed and vulnerable SharePoint instances on the internet.\n*   **Microsoft:** Researchers previously warned about nation-state interest in SharePoint vulnerabilities.\n*   **Google:** Researchers previously warned of opportunistic attacks targeting vulnerable SharePoint instances.\n*   **4L4MD4R ransomware:** Specific ransomware used by hackers to encrypt files and demand payment.\n*   **Windows Defender:** Security software that hackers disabled real-time monitoring on.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRansomware adds a new, non-nation-state financial threat to SharePoint vulnerabilities.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe American Council on Education and other major higher education associations are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to preserve a lower court\u2019s ruling that ordered the National Institutes of Health to reinstate funding for hundreds of canceled grants.\n\nIn June, a federal judge vacated NIH directives to nix grant funding for research related to diversity, equity and inclusion. The Trump administration quickly appealed the decision and asked the Supreme Court in July to pause the lower court\u2019s order while an appeals court considers the case.\n\nEight higher ed groups \u2014 including ACE, the Association of American Universities and the Association of American Medical Colleges \u2014 argued in legal filings Friday that allowing NIH to cancel the grants again would destabilize the nation\u2019s biomedical research and waste government funding on projects forced to stop midstream.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed several executive orders shortly after beginning his second term that prompted the NIH cancellations. One ordered federal agencies to terminate all \"equity-related\" grants \u201cto the maximum extent allowed by law,\u201d and another directed them to end federal funding for \u201cgender ideology,\u201d which the administration defined as the idea that gender exists on a spectrum.\n\nCivil rights groups have noted that anti-LGBT groups use the term \u201cgender ideology\u201d to cast being transgender as a political movement rather than a fundamental identity. And the American Medical Association has said that \u201ctrans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration canceled vast sums of scientific research funding following those orders. In NIH\u2019s case, the agency often informed researchers of the terminations by saying their work \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities.\u201d\n\nThe moves quickly drew legal challenges.\n\nResearchers and unions argued in an April lawsuit that the move was \u201ca reckless and illegal purge to stamp out NIH-funded research that addresses topics and populations that they disfavor.\u201d A coalition of states also filed a lawsuit that month challenging the terminations.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Young agreed with their arguments, ordering NIH in June to restore the plaintiff's canceled grants. According to a Monday press release from ACE, the order impacted roughly 1,200 grants \u2014 though that is only a fraction of the awards that the agency has terminated.\n\nSince the order only covered the plaintiffs\u2019 grants, ACE and other higher ed groups have also asked NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, in a July 29 letter, to reinstate the other awards canceled under the anti-DEI directives \u2014 \"in the spirit of fairness and consistency.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has appealed Young\u2019s decision. So far, federal officials have asked both Young and the appellate court to block the order to reinstate the grants while the appeals process plays out. Both rejected that request.\n\nThen last month, the Trump administration took it to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe higher education groups noted in their legal filings that grant applications undergo rigorous scientific review before NIH accepts them.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, however, the Executive Branch has jettisoned NIH\u2019s scientific decisionmaking via agencywide directives that mandated the termination en masse of NIH grants deemed related to disfavored political topics,\" their Friday filing argued.\n\nIf those terminations are allowed to stand during the appeals process, critical medical research into diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes will be ground to a halt, they said. The groups noted some researchers have had to abandon projects halfway through and lay off staff and students with knowledge of the work.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, has argued to the Supreme Court that Young didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to order NIH to reinstate the grants, arguing instead that the matter should proceed in the Court of Federal Claims. In its emergency request, it pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s April ruling that allowed the U.S. Department of Education to maintain a freeze on $65 million in canceled grant funding for teacher training.\n\nIn that ruling, the court's unsigned majority opinion said the government likely wouldn\u2019t be able to recover the funding once disbursed and added that the grant recipients would not \u201csuffer irreparable harm\u201d if a lower court\u2019s order to reinstate the grants was put on hold during the appeals process.\n\nThe Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to make a similar ruling in the NIH case.",

He attributed the shortfall to insufficient state funding and declining net tuition revenue combined with high inflation.\n\nThe flagship university is among the many higher education institutions cutting their budgets amid an uncertain financial landscape. UNL will also extend its hiring freeze for at least the second time and likely offer employees a voluntary separation package this fall, Bennett said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nA planning committee composed of administrators, faculty and student representatives plans to discuss potential budget cuts this week. Bennett will then take the committee's recommendations and propose a final budget plan to the head of the University of Nebraska system by the end of October, he said.\n\nThe plan may recommend degree program cuts or mergers that will allow UNL to capitalize on its \"existing strengths,\" the chancellor said.\n\nMoving forward, the university will prioritize growing extramural grants and contracts and increasing tuition revenue through higher enrollment and student retention, he said.\n\nUNL officials also hope to see additional revenue from a tuition hike approved by the University of Nebraska system\u2019s board in June.\n\nIn-state undergraduate tuition at UNL will increase from $277 to $291 per credit hour for the 2025-26 academic year. For out-of-state students, the cost will rise from $888 to $932.\n\nIn the same vote approving the tuition increase, the system board cut more than $20 million from its budget.\n\nLike Bennett, the system board cited \"a legislative session in which the university received modest funding increases that do not fully cover inflationary pressures, rising employee benefit costs or strategic investments.\"\n\nThe University of Nebraska relies heavily on state funding. In the fiscal 2024-25 year, a fifth of the system's operating budget \u2014 just under $700 million \u2014 came from state appropriations.\n\nHowever, recent increases to the state's higher education funding have been nominal and have not kept pace with inflation.\n\nEarlier this year, Nebraska\u2019s Legislature raised the University of Nebraska's state funding by 1.25% over the next two years. The bump fell well short of inflation and the system's requested increase of 3.5%.\n\nBut that's still a significant improvement over Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's initial proposal. Pillen, who served as a system regent for a decade, sought to cut the system's funding by 2%, which would have amounted to a loss of $14.3 million.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bennett referenced the series of austerity measures the university has undertaken in recent years and expressed hope that the next round of cuts could help UNL achieve operational stability.\n\n\"I want to realize a future for UNL in which faculty and staff are not repeatedly asked to do the same quality and amount of work with fewer resources \u2014 but rather are provided the support and opportunity to excel beyond current levels of success,\" he said",

The process will neither charge students application fees nor require them to upload additional materials like essays or recommendation letters.\n\nStates have increasingly turned to direct admissions as a way to reach out to students who may not have considered higher education or don't view themselves as college material.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe direct admissions portal is set to open to students on Aug. 26. To participate in the first round of offers, interested students must upload their transcripts by Sept. 23 to receive their acceptances by Oct. 6.\n\nThe participating colleges are primarily public institutions, like Alabama State University, the University of Montevallo and the state's community colleges. The list also includes some historically Black institutions, such as Alabama A&M University and the private Tuskegee University. The University of Alabama, the state's flagship, and Auburn University are not participating.\n\nMany participating colleges will include merit-based scholarships with their offers, according to the initiative's website.\n\n\"The goal is to make college more affordable from the start,\" it said.\n\nStudents will also have the opportunity to indicate interest in acceptance notifications from out-of-state institutions, per the website. Those offers would come later in October, it said.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey called the initiative \"a smart, student-centered solution\" that demonstrates the state's focus on educational opportunities and workforce readiness.\n\nAlabama Possible, a nonprofit that\u2019s focused on educational attainment and economic opportunity in the state, is leading the direct admissions initiative in partnership with the Alabama Department of Education and the state community college system. The student-college matching software, Appily Match, is a product of education company EAB.\n\nChandra Scott, executive director of Alabama Possible, said Thursday that direct admissions supports the state's workforce and economic mobility goals.\n\n\u201cDirect admissions eliminates uncertainty and sends a clear message to Alabama students: you are college-ready and you belong,\u201d Scott said in a statement.\n\nNationwide, higher education officials may look to direct admissions to bolster enrollment amid a looming contraction of the K-12 student pipeline.\n\nOne of the earliest statewide direct admissions programs, started by Idaho in 2015, raised first-time undergraduate enrollment by a little over 8%, according to a 2022 study.\n\nSince Idaho, several other states have pursued direct admissions programs to both boost college attendance among residents and increase enrollment at public institutions.\n\nOne of Alabama's neighbors similarly invested in direct admissions this summer. Last month, Tennessee announced it would launch a direct admissions pilot this November, automatically offering college acceptance to students based on their academic records and their completion of the Tennessee Promise application.\n\nThe Tennessee pilot, which includes students from a randomly selected pool of high schools, will also provide roughly half of the recipients with personalized financial aid information to see if that increases their chances of enrolling in college.\n\nLast year, The Common Application expanded its direct admissions program to send automatic acceptance letters from 116 colleges to first-generation and low- and middle-income students.\n\nAnd Utah launched a similar acceptance program last year, offering the state\u2019s high school students guaranteed admissions to at least one of its public colleges. While direct admissions offers students college acceptances without an application, guaranteed admissions promises eligible students that they will be accepted if they apply.",

        "summary": "Here's a summary of the article in the Smart Brevity style:\n\n**Alabama Launches Direct College Admissions for Students**\n\n**Key details:**\nAlabama's new initiative offers high school seniors direct admission to 16 four-year and 23 community colleges. Students upload transcripts to an online portal to receive automatic offers without application fees, essays, or recommendation letters. Participating colleges will include merit-based scholarships with their offers, with a stated goal to make college more affordable. Students can also indicate interest in out-of-state acceptances.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis initiative aims to bolster enrollment for participating colleges amidst a looming contraction of the K-12 student pipeline, potentially challenging the broader consensus of declining college attendance. By removing application fees and requirements, it seeks to attract students who might not have considered higher education, directly impacting the financial health and student body size of these institutions. The program's success could provide a model for other states facing similar enrollment challenges.\n\n**The big picture:**\nStates nationwide are increasingly turning to direct admissions programs to increase college attendance among residents and boost enrollment at public institutions. This trend is a response to the looming contraction of the K-12 student pipeline. Idaho started one of the earliest statewide programs in 2015, which raised first-time undergraduate enrollment by over 8%. Other states like Tennessee and Utah have also launched similar initiatives.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   16 four-year institutions participating\n*   23 community colleges participating\n*   Aug. 26: Direct admissions portal opens\n*   Sept. 23: Deadline for first round transcript uploads\n*   Oct. 6: Students receive acceptances for first round\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Alabama Direct Admission Initiative:** New program offering high school students automatic college admissions based on transcripts.\n*   **Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey:** Called the initiative \"a smart, student-centered solution\" demonstrating focus on educational opportunities.\n*   **Alabama Possible:** Nonprofit leading the initiative, focused on educational attainment and economic opportunity.\n*   **Alabama Department of Education:** Partnered with Alabama Possible and the community college system on the initiative.\n*   **State community college system:** Partnered on the initiative, with 23 of its colleges participating.\n*   **Appily Match:** Student-college matching software used by the initiative, developed by education company EAB.\n*   **EAB:** Education company that developed the Appily Match software used for the initiative.\n*   **Chandra Scott:** Executive director of Alabama Possible, stated direct admissions supports workforce and economic mobility goals.\n*   **University of Alabama:** The state's flagship university, notably not participating in the initiative.\n*   **Auburn University:** Another major state university, notably not participating in the initiative.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The direct admissions portal is set to open to students on August 26.\n*   Students must upload transcripts by September 23 to receive acceptances by October 6.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAlabama aims to boost college enrollment and workforce readiness via direct admissions.",

But since then, lower-income students get less of a boost to their earnings potential than they once did, according to a recent working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nWhat changed their trajectory? Lower-income college students are now less likely to enroll at research universities and study fields with high returns than their higher-income peers, the researchers found.\n\nThat shift has affected the long-term earning potential of low-income students. The wage premium they receive from going to college \u2014 referring to the average wage difference between those who completed a year of college and those who didn\u2019t \u2014 has halved since 1960, the paper stated.\n\n\u201cThe declining relative value of college-going for lower-income students since 1960 has significantly disrupted those students\u2019 upward mobility,\u201d according to the paper, written by a pair of economics professors from Princeton University and Vanderbilt University.\n\nThe working paper\u2019s findings come amid debates around the high cost of higher education and the sector\u2019s ability to help graduates land well-paying jobs. At the same time, it raises the question of whether encouraging low-income students towards community college or trade schools compared to four-year institutions is best for their long-term financial prospects.\n\nWhat did the data show?\n\nThe researchers analyzed dozens of surveys and administrative datasets that document wage premiums and the returns provided by colleges and majors between 1900 and 2020.\n\nThe paper found that three factors contributed to 80% of the decreases in wage premiums seen by low-income students attending college.\n\nAccording to the paper, colleges historically attended by lower-income students have become much less valuable in terms of economic benefits.\n\nLow-income students often attend teaching-oriented public universities, which have experienced declines in \u201cfunding, retention, and economic value since 1960,\u201d the authors stated. Since the 1980s, low-income students have also increasingly attended community colleges and for-profit institutions, which tend to offer less value than teaching-oriented public universities, the paper added.\n\nHigher-income students, meanwhile, have disproportionately enrolled at research-oriented universities, whose quality has significantly improved over the years, with better student-to-faculty ratios, revenues and expenditures per student, and higher graduation rates, the paper added.\n\nBefore the 1960s, less than 2 percentage points of the income gap between higher- and lower-income students who attended college could be attributed to institutional choice, the paper stated. But that choice explains more than 5 percentage points of the gap today.\n\nHigher-income students were also more likely to shift from humanities majors to more lucrative fields such as computer science between 2000 and 2014 \u2014 likely due to academic entry restrictions into those majors that excluded lower-income students, the paper stated. These obstacles redirected lower-income students into the shrinking humanities disciplines.\n\nLower-income students now receive less than half the earnings boost from college as their higher-income peers. Factors like institutional choice and major have contributed more to those declining earnings than changes in access to high-quality universities and the net cost of tuition, the working paper concluded.",

The Department of Justice found UCLA violated civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish and Israeli students. As a result, UCLA's research funding has been suspended by federal agencies. Northwestern University is reportedly in talks with the Trump administration about a possible settlement involving a payment to resolve investigations.

Of that, $3.3 billion of the canceled funding hadn\u2019t yet been disbursed. The analysis did not account for frozen research grants, suggesting the level of hampered research funding across the nation may rise even higher.\n\nHealey\u2019s announcement pointed to the state\u2019s economic reliance on federal research funding. The state received nearly $8.6 billion in federal research funding in fiscal year 2024, which supported roughly 81,000 jobs and $7.8 billion in household income, recent findings from the University of Massachusetts Amherst found.\n\nMoreover, Massachusetts accounts for 1 in 10 research and development jobs in the U.S., according to the announcement.\n\nHalf of the $400 million would go toward a one-time funding pool to help pay for projects at universities, hospitals and research institutions. This pool would also support a one-year fellowship program for early-career researchers, the announcement said.\n\nThat pot of money would be housed at MassDevelopment, the state\u2019s development finance agency, and Massachusetts would use interest from its state stabilization fund to finance it.\n\nThe other half of the $400 million would be housed in a bridge funding reserve for the state\u2019s public colleges. That funding would support research costs, partnerships and jobs, including positions for graduate and postdoctorate students.\n\nThat fund would be paid for from revenue from Massachusetts\u2019 Fair Share, which adds a 4% tax on those with incomes above $1 million.\n\nSeveral university leaders in the state praised the proposal. They include the president of the University of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s public university system, as well as leaders of private institutions including Boston University, Northeastern University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cAdvances that spring from our universities, hospitals and laboratories benefit all Americans; if we see these institutions diminished or compromised, all Americans stand to lose,\u201d MIT President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth noted that \u201cno other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale.\u201d\n\nMIT has seen over $6 million worth of federal grants terminated, according to Center for American Progress data.\n\nMassachusetts is also home to Harvard University, which the Trump administration has cut off from all future federal research funding. Earlier this month, Harvard officials said the Trump administration\u2019s actions combined with recent congressional moves, such as raising the endowment tax wealthy institutions pay, could cost the university $1 billion a year.",

The two groups entered a written agreement in 2023 that the university would not use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name alone.\n\nLast year, Columbia University\u2019s webstore offered for sale shirts, sweatshirts and hats that bare the word \u201cColumbia\u201d on its own, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say violate the contract and its trademark rights.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is seeking a jury trial in the complaint against Columbia University. It also asks that the university be prevented from using the trademark name alone on apparel and accessories, along with recalling any such products currently in the university\u2019s possession. The brand also is seeking monetary damages.\n\nIn 2023, the sportswear company said the two groups entered a written agreement whereby the university could use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name, for which the sportswear company has a trademark, if the name was used with one other distinguishing mark associated with the university, such as its shield, crown or lion mascot logo, or words, such as \u201cuniversity,\u201d \u201cColumbia Law,\u201d or its year of founding.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Columbia Sportswear is headquartered in Portland, Oregon.\n\nSome of the Columbia University apparel mentioned in the lawsuit include the Nike and Champion logos, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say can create customer confusion and a false association between Columbia Sportswear and its competitors.\n\nAn example of Columbia University\u2019s allegedly infringing products. Retrieved from Court Filing\n\n\u201cThough Columbia Sportswear and Nike are headquartered in the same State and are both highly reputable sporting apparel designers and have a generally friendly relationship, the two companies have never collaborated to jointly design, manufacture, market, or sell any product,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA consumer looking at the Infringing Merchandise would never know that, and, in fact, would reasonably be induced into believing the companies had.\u201d\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this case will be settled out of court, and fairly quickly, said Josh Gerben, trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Columbia Sportswear\u2019s version of the story in the complaint is not entirely accurate, and Columbia University decides to defend the case, things could get interesting,\u201d Gerben said in an email. \u201cThis is because Columbia University has been around much longer than Columbia Sportswear. It gives the university some very interesting defenses to the overall claims regarding trademark infringement.\u201d\n\nColumbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday. In Q1, the company reported a net sales increase of 1% to $778.5 million. At the time of the announcement, the company withdrew its full-year financial outlook due to economic uncertainty related to tariffs.",

The prior agreement stipulated the university must use \"Columbia\" with a distinguishing mark or word. Sportswear claims this creates customer confusion and a false association with competitors like Nike and Champion. The company is seeking a jury trial, prevention of solitary \"Columbia\" name use, product recall, and monetary damages.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit highlights the importance of intellectual property and brand protection for companies like Columbia Sportswear. It matters because the alleged breach involves a specific written agreement from 2023, potentially making the legal path clearer for Sportswear. The inclusion of competitor logos on allegedly infringing university apparel could dilute Sportswear's brand identity and create market confusion. For investors, this legal action could impact Columbia Sportswear's brand value or divert operational resources. This challenges a potential consensus view that established entities with similar names can easily coexist under prior agreements, indicating unexpected legal disputes can arise impacting a company's brand clarity and market position.\n\n**The big picture:** Columbia Sportswear holds a trademark for the \"Columbia\" name used on apparel.

A 30% to 40% decline in new foreign students would lead to a 15% overall drop in international enrollment and, with it, a potential loss of $7 billion in revenue for colleges and 60,000 higher education jobs, NAFSA estimated.\n\nThe organization attributed the projected decline to various Trump administration actions, including travel bans and an earlier suspension of visa interviews. NAFSA called on Congress to direct the State Department to expedite processing for student visas.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPreliminary data from early this year suggested \u201cflat to modest growth\u201d in international student enrollment, but NASFA pointed to policy changes that could alter the landscape ahead.\n\nSince President Donald Trump retook office this year, many in the higher education world have worried international enrollment would decline in response to his policies and the perceptions abroad about America and how welcoming it will be to foreign students.\n\nHis administration has indeed taken an aggressive stance on admitting students from outside the U.S. In June, Trump signed an executive order banning travel from 12 countries and imposing restrictions on seven others. And the president has recently considered bans on 36 more countries.\n\nAlso in June, the State Department announced expanded screening that included surveillance of social media posts for applicants of F, M and J nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThat followed an announcement in May from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the U.S. would move to \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas for Chinese students. Trump later appeared to walk back that stance on social media, adding more confusion as to the administration\u2019s actual policy.\n\nNAFSA pointed to reports of limited to no visa review appointments for prospective international students in India, China, Nigeria and Japan. The organization noted that India and China send the most international students to the U.S., while Nigeria and Japan are the seventh and 13th leading home countries, respectively.\n\nOn top of those moves, the administration has demonstrated interest in using international student enrollment as leverage against institutions and activists in Trump\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThrough various directives, for example,Trump and his government have tried to bar Harvard from enrolling international students in the administration\u2019s ongoing feud with the university. Each of those efforts have been temporarily blocked in court. Had they not been, the consequences for Harvard would likely be dire. In the 2024-25 academic year, the Ivy League university\u2019s roughly 6,800 foreign students made up 27.2% of its student body.\n\nEarlier this year, the administration also moved to deny visas for pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nA July report from analysts with Moody\u2019s ratings services pointed to the potential financial fallout for colleges from declines in international enrollment. They noted that foreign students tend to pay full tuition and fees, heightening the potential revenue impact.\n\nA stress test by the analysts found that for 130 colleges they rate, a 20% drop in international enrollment would translate into a 0.5 percentage-point hit to their earnings margin before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization. For 18 colleges, EBITDA margin loss would be 2 to 8 points. Those with already low margins could face \u201csignificant financial stress,\u201d the analysts said.",

Some 1,000 companies, nonprofits and public agencies signed their name to a letter urging the EPA director to maintain Energy Star. Among the groups advocating for Energy Star were the Sierra Club, the American Bakers Association, the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance and the International Facility Management Association.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201cinteresting bedfellows\u201d situation, Justin Koscher, president of the Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association, said in a Grist story. Polyisocyanurate insulation is a commercial roofing product. \u201cIt\u2019s not too often you get all of those groups saying the exact same thing on one particular issue.\u201d\n\nCritics of the program say energy efficiency standards are something that would be more appropriately managed by the private sector.\n\n\u201cGreen purchasing programs assume the federal government needs to meddle in the marketplace by providing its seal of approval on what it deems to be environmentally satisfactory products,\u201d the Competitive Enterprise Institute says in a white paper published in March. \u201cIf there is a need to create a labeling program to ensure credibility and consumer confidence, then private certification organizations should play such a role.\u201d\n\nSupporters credit Energy Star\u2019s voluntary efficiency standards with saving businesses and consumers some $500 billion in energy spending since the program was created while costing EPA a fraction of that to administer.\n\nThe program\u2019s \u201cannual budget of approximately $32 million represents less than 1% of EPA\u2019s spending,\u201d supporters say in their letter to the EPA director.\n\nDespite Congress\u2019 support, the program could be at risk if lawmakers fail to pass this and other appropriations bills and rely instead on temporary continuing resolutions to fund programs, Rogers says in her U.S. Green Building Council update. A full-year continuing resolution, she said, \u201cwill likely not include detailed congressional direction or specific funding levels for most programs, giving the administration more flexibility to determine how funds are spent within agencies. That could leave the ENERGY STAR program vulnerable to being defunded or privatized.\u201d",

House appropriators passed their own version on July 22, proposing at least $32 million. These moves directly counter the Trump administration's fiscal 2026 budget request, released in early May, which eliminated all funding for the Atmospheric Protection Program that administers Energy Star. The administration cited \"overreach of Government authority\" and \"unnecessary and radical climate change regulations\" for its decision. The two bills still require floor votes and reconciliation before reaching the President.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis legislative action challenges the current consensus view, represented by the Trump administration, that energy efficiency standards are government overreach and should be private sector managed. Lawmakers are sending a clear message to maintain Energy Star, highlighting its \"strong bipartisan support\" since 1992. Supporters argue the program's voluntary standards have saved businesses and consumers approximately $500 billion, while costing the EPA less than 1% of its budget. This congressional effort underscores a legislative preference for continued government involvement in efficiency standards.\n\n**The big picture:**\nEnergy Star is a program established in 1992 that provides voluntary energy efficiency standards. It has historically enjoyed popularity across both political parties. The Trump administration's budget proposal to eliminate its funding sparked a significant backlash, with about 1,000 companies, nonprofits, and public agencies signing a letter urging its maintenance. Critics, however, believe that \"green purchasing programs\" and energy efficiency standards are more appropriately managed by the private sector, not the federal government.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$36 million:** Funding level for Energy Star in the Senate-passed bill for fiscal 2026.\n*   **At least $32,000,000:** Funding level for Energy Star in the House-passed bill.\n*   **1992:** Year the Energy Star program was enacted.\n*   **Some 1,000:** Number of companies, nonprofits, and public agencies that signed a letter urging Energy Star's maintenance.\n*   **$500 billion:** Estimated energy savings for businesses and consumers credited to the program.\n*   **Less than 1%:** Energy Star's annual budget ($32 million) represents this percentage of EPA's spending.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Senate Appropriations Committee:** Passed a bill to fund the Energy Star program at $36 million.\n*   **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Administers the Energy Star program, facing a proposed budget cut.\n*   **Donald Trump:** The President whose administration proposed eliminating Energy Star funding in its 2026 budget.\n*   **Sabine Rogers:** Federal policy manager at the U.S. Green Building Council, highlighting bipartisan support and risks.\n*   **U.S. Green Building Council:** An organization whose policy manager commented on Energy Star's support and vulnerabilities.\n*   **Sierra Club:** An organization that advocated for Energy Star, signing a letter to maintain the program.\n*   **American Bakers Association:** An organization that advocated for Energy Star, signing a letter to maintain the program.\n*   **Pool and Hot Tub Alliance:** An organization that advocated for Energy Star, signing a letter to maintain the program.\n*   **International Facility Management Association:** An organization that advocated for Energy Star, signing a letter to maintain the program.\n*   **Justin Koscher:** President of Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association, noted the broad support coalition.\n*   **Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association:** Its president commented on the diverse group of Energy Star supporters.\n*   **Competitive Enterprise Institute:** A critic of the program, advocating for private sector management of efficiency standards.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Senate and House bills still face floor votes and must be reconciled into a single bill.\n*   The legislation will then go to President Donald Trump for signature into law.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCongress is pushing to maintain Energy Star funding despite the Trump administration's elimination efforts.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJLL grew revenue 10% year over year during the second quarter, with resilient business revenues up 11% and transactional revenues up 7% during that time, according to the firm\u2019s second quarter earnings report.\n\nThe double-digit revenue growth across resilient businesses, which include workplace, project and property management services; value and risk advisory; and software and solutions, demonstrates the \u201csignificant untapped potential for outsourcing penetration across industries over the long term,\u201d CEO Christian Ulbrich said on the company\u2019s Aug. 6 earnings call.\n\n\u201cOur investments in data technology and artificial intelligence are integral to our growth strategy, to enhancing operational efficiency and to delivering on client demand for integrated end-to-end real estate management solutions and data-driven insights,\u201d he said.\n\nReal estate management services revenue rose 11% year over year, led by strong performance in workplace management, which grew its revenue over 10% year over year and nearly 30% for the quarter, CFO Kelly Howe said. New client wins slightly outpaced mandate expansions, JLL said in its earnings presentation.\n\nProperty management revenue grew 4% year over year, while other portfolio services revenue fell 5%.\n\nThe firm\u2019s project management business increased its revenue 22% since last Q2, with new and expanded contracts in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions and mid-teens management fee increases that were supplemented by higher pass-through costs, JLL said. The acceleration in project management revenue stems from strong leasing revenue over the past several quarters, as well as \u201cincremental investments in our platform and human capital,\u201d CFO Kelly Howe said on an earnings call.\n\nLeasing revenue grew 5% year over year, with growth across all major asset classes, particularly continued momentum in industrial and office. Revenue growth was most significant in the U.S., JLL said.\n\nAccording to the company, U.S. office leasing revenue increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, growing nearly 3%, while market volume declined 3%.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, our leasing pipeline is stable, and business confidence \u2026 has been resilient considering the macro backdrop, providing reason for cautious optimism for modest growth in the near term,\u201d Howe said. \u201cClient demand for high-quality and energy-efficient assets, which are becoming increasingly scarce \u2026 remains a consistent trend. Within office, tenant requirements are generally steady, with sectors such as professional services, finance and legal driving demand in many markets.\u201d\n\nA notable increase in deal size for U.S. offices was largely offset by lower volume as the asset class was up low-single-digits, JLL said. Large transactions are facing headwinds related to a lack of new supply hitting the market, according to Ulbrich.\n\n\u201cTenants need to move from their expectations of potentially signing agreements on the best buildings,\u201d Ulbrich said. \u201cThey have to just accept that the best buildings are more or less sold out, and they have to move a little bit down, which has the benefit on the other side that you will see a lot of upgrading of those type of A-minus buildings, and that is then strengthening our project management business again.\u201d",

        "summary": "Here is the summary of the article in the Smart Brevity style:\n\n**JLL Posts Resilient Q2 Growth Amidst Shifting Real Estate Demands**\n\n**Key details:** JLL's Q2 revenue grew 10% year-over-year, with resilient businesses up 11% and transactional revenues up 7%. Project management revenue jumped 22% since last Q2, fueled by new contracts in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. U.S. office leasing revenue increased nearly 3% for the sixth consecutive quarter, despite a 3% decline in market volume. Workplace management revenue also saw significant growth, rising over 10% year-over-year.\n\n**Why it matters:** JLL's robust revenue growth in resilient businesses signals substantial untapped potential for outsourcing across industries. The firm's sixth consecutive quarter of U.S. office leasing revenue growth, defying a 3% market volume decline, suggests JLL's resilience in a challenging sector. This performance may challenge a negative consensus view on commercial real estate, particularly office, indicating JLL's ability to capture demand. Strong client demand for high-quality assets also continues to drive positive trends.\n\n**The big picture:** JLL's growth strategy is deeply tied to investments in data technology and artificial intelligence to boost efficiency and meet client demand for integrated solutions. The firm's project management revenue acceleration is linked to strong past leasing performance and internal investments in its platform. CEO Christian Ulbrich noted that a lack of new supply for prime buildings creates headwinds for large transactions. This trend may shift tenants to \"A-minus\" buildings, potentially boosting JLL's project management business via upgrades.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Revenue grew 10% year over year during Q2.\n*   Resilient business revenues were up 11%; transactional revenues up 7%.\n*   Project management business revenue increased 22% since last Q2.\n*   U.S. office leasing revenue increased nearly 3% for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n*   U.S. office market volume declined 3%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **JLL:** The global real estate firm reporting strong Q2 revenue growth across several segments.\n*   **Christian Ulbrich:** JLL's CEO, highlighted outsourcing potential and market challenges for prime buildings.\n*   **Kelly Howe:** JLL's CFO, provided specific revenue figures and outlook for leasing pipeline and demand.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** JLL demonstrates resilience and growth in key segments despite market headwinds.",

        "summary_text": "While brands like Texas Roadhouse and Olive Garden continue to thrive, many casual dining chains have halted expansion, closed stores or filed for bankruptcy, leaving a glut of former restaurant properties with few buyers.\n\nCasual dining real estate is in a major slowdown, as property sale success rates have plummeted from 72% in 2021 to just 37% in 2024, according to data from Northmarq, a commercial real estate firm. This decline is primarily driven by fundamental mismatches between available properties and the changing needs of restaurants, which make it increasingly challenging to repurpose former casual dining locations.\n\nThe dramatic decline reflects economic headwinds that have reshaped the restaurant landscape, from the lasting impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior to rising labor costs and the growth of fast casual dining, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\n\"It's definitely a nationwide trend,\" said Matt Lipson, senior vice president and co-founder of the national restaurant group at Northmarq. \"Beyond a few exceptions, there's just this clear drop off.\"\n\nSize mismatches are driving conversion problems\n\nThere\u2019s a fundamental size mismatch between available casual dining properties and what growing restaurant chains actually need as brands, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, look to downsize. A typical Red Lobster location averages about 7,600 square feet on 1.68 acres, while a Chipotle operates in just over 2,400 square feet on 0.99 acres, Northmarq data shows.\n\nAccording to Lipson, most fast casual chains won\u2019t consider retrofitting casual dining properties because they don\u2019t meet their rigid site selection criteria.\n\nThat\u2019s because the conversion costs are high: Tenant improvements can run $200 per square foot, Lipson said, making a Red Lobster conversion too expensive for smaller-format concepts.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of cases, it's easier just to knock down the building and have a developer split it up,\u201d said David Orkin, executive vice president and restaurant practice leader for the Americas at CBRE. He said landlords are increasingly dividing properties into multiple smaller spaces.\n\nMany older restaurant buildings are essentially worthless to new casual dining tenants, as well. Orkin cited a recent example where his team discovered an old Macaroni Grill \u201chad negative value\u201d once they began to analyze construction costs, with renovation costs exceeding those of demolition and reconstruction.\n\nA closed TGI Fridays in Leesburg, Virginia, as seen on Dec. 28, 2024. Julie Littman/Restaurant Dive\n\nEconomic pressures compound challenges\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered consumer dining habits while devastating the finances of many full-service operators. Even as restrictions lifted, fear of dining out persisted, and revenue collapses led to casual dining closures that have created lasting negative perceptions.\n\n\u201cEvery time there's bankruptcy news \u2014 and there's a lot of it \u2014 or every time there's store closure news, it starts passing on to the other brands,\u201d Lipson said. \u201cIt affects consumer behavior, because there's just so much bad news around these places.\u201d\n\nRising labor costs have also had a significant impact on casual dining operations, which typically require 25 or more staff members \u2014 far more than a typical fast casual or quick-service restaurant, Lipson said. Minimum wage increases that might be manageable for a fast casual or drive-thru concept can be crushing for full-service restaurants operating on razor-thin margins.\n\nHigher construction costs have also made new builds more expensive, and restaurants are moving toward smaller footprints in response, according to Lipson. The average new quick-serve restaurant build has decreased from 3,000 square feet in 2016 to approximately 2,200 square feet today, with many operators switching to 950-square-foot modular buildings that focus entirely on drive-thru service, according to Lipson.\n\nMarket dynamics favor the strongest players\n\nThe construction slowdown has created a market of haves and have-nots, where the strongest casual dining brands can cherry-pick premium locations.\n\n\u201cThere is no one to take those B, C, D sites,\u201d Lipson said.\n\nLess desirable properties often sell to non-restaurant buyers, such as car dealerships, looking to expand. That\u2019s because cap rates \u2014 which calculate a property\u2019s ROI by dividing its net operating income by its asset value \u2014 rose significantly as interest rates climbed, further depressing property values and making it harder to make deals.\n\nAt the same time, some quick-service restaurants are competing directly with casual dining for prime real estate. New Chick-fil-A locations require nearly 1.6 acres, compared with one acre, historically, and larger margins allow them to pay higher rents than casual dining brands, Lipson said.\n\nWendellandCarolyn via Getty Images\n\nSigns of recovery emerge\n\nDespite the issues, there are reasons for optimism. Development activity is \u201cturning back on pretty aggressively\u201d in 2025 as sales rebound, Orkin said.\n\n\u201cRight now, it's actually pretty vibrant,\u201d Orkin said, noting that the struggles are often brand-specific rather than industry-wide. \u201cThere are a lot of older, tired brands that have kind of lost their relevance. Those are the ones that are kind of struggling.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly because millennials are returning to casual dining as they age, after driving the growth of fast casual restaurants earlier in their lives.\n\n\u201cThese millennials are having families, right? And so their shopping patterns, their lives are different, and they're going to start doing what their parents did,\u201d Orkin said.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t offered much solace to landlords who now regret investing in casual dining real estate.\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cjust like, \u2018Oh my, I could have bought anything else in the world,\u2019\u201d Lipson said.",

This decline is primarily driven by fundamental size mismatches between available casual dining properties and the smaller footprints growing restaurant chains now need. Conversion costs, potentially running $200 per square foot, make retrofitting these larger spaces too expensive for smaller concepts. Some older restaurant buildings are now considered to have \"negative value\" because renovation costs exceed demolition and reconstruction. Landlords are increasingly dividing properties into multiple smaller spaces to adapt.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe dramatic decline in real estate sales challenges the consensus view that properties are simply cyclical assets, revealing deep structural issues beyond economic downturns. It highlights that large, existing casual dining footprints are often unusable due to rigid modern site selection criteria and prohibitively high conversion costs. This situation creates a market of \"haves and have-nots,\" where only the strongest brands can cherry-pick prime, new-build locations. It also signals a lasting shift in demand for restaurant real estate, driven by changing consumer behaviors and operational models. The struggle of these properties may also affect landlord investment strategies in the commercial real estate sector.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMany casual dining chains have halted expansion, closed stores, or filed for bankruptcy, leaving a surplus of former restaurant properties. Economic headwinds like the lasting impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior and rising labor costs have significantly reshaped the restaurant landscape. The growth of fast-casual dining has also shifted demand towards smaller, more efficient footprints. Frequent news of bankruptcies and store closures creates negative perceptions, further affecting consumer behavior across the casual dining sector. Higher construction costs also encourage new builds to be smaller, further reducing demand for large existing sites.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Casual dining property sale success rates: plummeted from 72% in 2021 to 37% in 2024.\n*   Typical Red Lobster location: averages 7,600 square feet on 1.68 acres.\n*   Chipotle operates: just over 2,400 square feet on 0.99 acres.\n*   Tenant improvements: can run $200 per square foot.\n*   Average new quick-serve restaurant build: decreased from 3,000 sq ft in 2016 to approximately 2,200 sq ft today.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Northmarq:** Commercial real estate firm, provided critical data on declining property sale success rates.\n*   **Matt Lipson:** Senior VP at Northmarq, described nationwide trend of drop-off in casual dining real estate.\n*   **CBRE:** Real estate firm whose executive discussed dividing properties and high conversion costs.\n*   **David Orkin:** Executive VP at CBRE, stated development is \"vibrant\" for some brands, noted millennial return.\n*   **Texas Roadhouse & Olive Garden:** Casual dining brands explicitly mentioned as continuing to thrive.\n*   **Red Lobster & Chipotle:** Used to illustrate size mismatch challenges for casual dining property conversion.\n*   **Chick-fil-A:** Quick-service brand requiring large sites, competing directly for prime real estate.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Development activity for restaurants is projected to \"turn back on pretty aggressively\" in 2025 as sales rebound.\n*   Millennials, as they age and have families, are noted to be returning to casual dining.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCasual dining real estate faces deep structural issues, challenging landlords and impacting valuations.",

The segment made up 51% of the region\u2019s fee revenue during the second quarter.\n\nGlobally, the services segment saw 6% year over year organic growth, with Cushman & Wakefield winning new business and driving incremental growth within its portfolio of existing customers, CEO Michelle MacKay said on the company\u2019s Aug. 5 earnings call. She noted that an intensified focus on client retention has resulted in a 96% retention rate in its Global Occupier Services over the past year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a notable improvement,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us some tools to apply across the services business in general. People have believed historically that [retention] even in the low 90s was compelling, but we\u2019re providing that we can really create a much stickier environment for our clients and services.\u201d\n\nLeasing revenue grew 9% year over year in the second quarter, with strong performance across all asset classes, particularly office and industrial, despite the shifting tariff climate, according to MacKay.\n\n\u201cThe macro uncertainty has now been a constant throughout the year, and our business has performed really well under it, because people continue to make decisions,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cLeaders of businesses have been tuned into the fact that they have to be able to make decisions through the noise. So how does that impact leasing? Well, they're still striking leasing deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur leasing business continues to run on all cylinders. We see this acutely in our multi-market occupier group, where mandate complexity is increasing, driving average contract revenue about 45% in the first half of this year,\u201d MacKay said.\n\nResponding to a question about headlines that markets are \u201crunning out of recovery,\u201d pushing occupiers toward sub-trophy space, MacKay confirmed the trend and said that it has begun to expand outside New York City to other cities that include Boston, Dallas, Miami and Houston.\n\n\u201cNon-gateway markets like Phoenix, San Diego and Toronto were also strong for us, so the regional strength is broadening as well,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cSo the regional strength is broadening as well. And yes, you\u2019re seeing the move from what you would consider a [Class A] space into what you might consider an A-minus space.\u201d\n\nMacKay noted that industrial markets are showing strength for the firm, despite cooling from pandemic highs, with revenues growing 8% year over year in the Americas.\n\n\u201cWhile the industrial market cooled from that pandemic-fueled boom, it's still growing,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cIn Q2 alone, the sector recorded almost 30 million square feet of net absorption, so although the pace has moderated a bit, industrial users are still expanding and taking space.\u201d\n\nIndustrial rents have soared since the pandemic, MacKay said.

This performance was primarily driven by strength in leasing, capital markets, and valuation segments within its Americas business. The firm's Americas services segment revenue increased 1% year over year to just under $610 million. Globally, the services segment achieved 6% year-over-year organic growth by winning new business and growing existing customer portfolios. Leasing revenue specifically grew 9% year over year across all asset classes, including office and industrial.\n\n**Why it matters:** The company's strong performance, particularly in leasing, occurred despite \"macro uncertainty\" that has been constant throughout the year. CEO Michelle MacKay stated that businesses continue to make decisions and strike leasing deals despite market noise. This challenges the consensus view that markets are \"running out of recovery,\" as MacKay confirmed a trend of occupiers moving to sub-trophy spaces, expanding beyond New York City to cities like Boston, Dallas, and Houston. Non-gateway markets such as Phoenix and San Diego also showed strength, indicating broadening regional performance.\n\n**The big picture:** Cushman & Wakefield presented its second quarter earnings, with CEO Michelle MacKay providing details on an August 5 earnings call. The firm has intensified its focus on client retention, achieving a 96% retention rate in its Global Occupier Services over the past year. MacKay noted this is a \"notable improvement,\" providing tools to create a \"much stickier environment\" for clients.

For large events like that, the White House sets up a tent on the grounds with a covered walkway.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Trump said when taking questions last week on the project. \u201cThe tent\u2019s 100 yards \u2013 that\u2019s more than a football field away from the main entrance. People are shlepping down to the tent. It\u2019s not a pretty sight. The women with their lovely evening gowns, their hair all done, and they\u2019re a mess by the time they get [there].\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little disagreement among people who are familiar with the White House complex that the lack of event space is a problem.\n\n\u201cYou can see where [a larger ballroom] makes sense,\u201d Anita McBride, former chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, said in a report by The Hill. To host an event, she said, staff are \u201cputting up staging, putting up a covered structure, getting people to the actual location, dealing with inclement weather. And you\u2019re not really having your event in the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand why someone who thinks on a grand scale, as obviously President Trump does, would want this ballroom added,\u201d Barbara Perry, a presidential historian and co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, said in The Hill report.\n\nEvents smaller than a state dinner can be a problem, too, because they sometimes move beyond the East Wing, Edward Lengel, a former chief historian at the White House Historical Society, said in an NPR report.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to some of these functions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the previous White House curator who\u2019s complained to me about how guests spread out across the whole house. He mentioned getting eggnog on the wall paper. It becomes a challenge.\u201d\n\nCritics say the problem with the planned addition is its scale: at 90,000 square feet \u2013 big enough to host 650 people \u2013 it will dwarf the mansion itself, which is only 55,000 square feet.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that it really transitions the whole thing into a presidential palace,\u201d Lengel said. \u201cThat in some ways contradicts the original concept of the White House that the founders intended. [The mansion] is supposed to represent \u2026 a democratic symbol in a common democratic community.\u201d\n\nThe White House has hired McCrery Architects as lead architect for the design, AECOM for the engineering and Clark Construction for the general contracting.\n\nPreliminary drawings show a building that will be constructed over, and extended beyond, the East Wing, which today is primarily used for social events and hosts offices for the First Lady and her staff.\n\nThe exterior will closely match the neoclassical design aesthetic of the White House, according to the plans. The interior will be based on a Palladian-like structure lined with Corinthian columns and rows of Venetian windows, according to a review by The Architect\u2019s Newspaper. \u201cInside, a coffered ceiling will be adorned with glimmering gold accents. Large chandeliers and other massive candelabras will illuminate the interiors,\u201d the review says.\n\nUnlike structural changes to the original executive residence portion of the White House, the addition isn\u2019t subject to historic preservation review, a Building Design report says. For other historic buildings around the National Mall, major renovations typically go before the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission. Jim McCrery, head of McCrery Architects, is a past member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, appointed by Trump. White House renovations also typically go before the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.\n\n\u201cThe East Wing has no protected status equivalent to the Executive Residence,\u201d the Building Design report says.\n\nThe addition is expected to cost $200 million. Trump said the project will be privately funded. At that cost, the construction is expected to come in at $2,222 per square foot, The Architect\u2019s Newspaper report said.\n\nSecurity and other considerations unique to the White House will be a factor in the final cost. The White House said Trump has been meeting with the U.S. Secret Service, the White House Military Office and the National Park Service on what those considerations entail.\n\nAbsent federal dollars, Congress has little oversight of the work that gets done on the White House grounds. But it has customarily played a review role when major renovations are undertaken, Lengel said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a profound change to the architecture of that building, normally presidents don\u2019t simply just say, \u2018I\u2019m going to change all of this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey go through a process.\u201d\n\nTrump said he raised the issue of a ballroom with White House advisor David Axelrod when Barack Obama was president, and offered to build and pay for the work himself. But the offer didn't go anywhere, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump was disappointed the offer fell on deaf ears, Axelrod told NPR. \u201c\u2018I build the greatest ballrooms and you can come down to Florida to see them,\u2019\u201d Axelrod said Trump told him. Trump was referring to a 20,000-square foot ballroom he had built in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach. But the person Axelrod handed the offer off to didn\u2019t follow up, he said.\n\nThe \"tent never bothered me,\" Axelrod said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump plans massive private White House ballroom.\n\n**Key details:**\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans for a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom. This project aims to resolve a 150-year-old issue of insufficient space for social events. The addition, costing an estimated $200 million, will be privately funded. It will be constructed over and extend beyond the existing East Wing.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe planned 90,000-square-foot ballroom will significantly dwarf the 55,000-square-foot mansion itself. It seeks to eliminate the need for outdoor tents, which Trump described as \"a disaster\" in bad weather. Critics like Edward Lengel express concern that its scale could contradict the White House's \"democratic symbol\" concept. This project challenges typical renovation oversight because the East Wing lacks protected status, and private funding limits Congressional review.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPresidents have consistently faced a problem of limited space for large social events for 150 years. The current East Wing ballroom, the largest event space, can only seat up to 200 guests. For events requiring more space, like the 1979 state dinner for 1,300, tents are erected on the White House grounds. Edward Lengel noted that smaller events can lead to guests spreading throughout the house, causing issues like \"eggnog on the wallpaper.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **90,000 square feet:** Size of the planned White House ballroom.\n*   **150 years:** How long presidents have dealt with limited event space.\n*   **$200 million:** Expected cost of the new addition.\n*   **55,000 square feet:** Size of the White House mansion itself.\n*   **$2,222 per square foot:** Estimated construction cost based on the total cost.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Announced the 90,000-square-foot ballroom and plans to privately fund its construction.\n*   **Theodore Roosevelt:** Was president when the East Wing, housing the current largest event space, was built.\n*   **President Jimmy Carter:** Hosted the largest state dinner ever, with 1,300 people, in 1979.\n*   **Anita McBride:** Former chief of staff to Laura Bush, acknowledged the need for a larger ballroom.\n*   **Barbara Perry:** Presidential historian who understands President Trump's grand-scale thinking regarding the project.\n*   **Edward Lengel:** Former chief historian who expressed concerns that the ballroom contradicts the White House's original concept.\n*   **McCrery Architects:** Hired as the lead architect for the White House ballroom's design.\n*   **AECOM:** Hired to provide engineering services for the planned White House ballroom.\n*   **Clark Construction:** Hired as the general contractor for the White House ballroom project.\n*   **Jim McCrery:** Head of McCrery Architects, previously appointed by Trump to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.\n*   **U.S. Commission of Fine Arts:** Body that typically reviews major renovations around the National Mall.\n*   **National Capital Planning Commission:** Body that typically reviews major renovations around the National Mall.\n*   **Committee for the Preservation of the White House:** Group that usually reviews White House renovations.\n*   **U.S. Secret Service:** Meeting with Trump regarding security considerations for the new ballroom.\n*   **White House Military Office:** Meeting with Trump regarding considerations for the new ballroom.\n*   **National Park Service:** Meeting with Trump regarding considerations for the new ballroom.\n*   **David Axelrod:** White House advisor under Obama, previously discussed Trump's ballroom offer.\n*   **Barack Obama:** President when Trump first offered to build and pay for a White House ballroom.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Construction on the White House ballroom is slated to begin in September.\n*   Trump is meeting with various agencies on security and other project considerations.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTrump's privately funded ballroom project aims to fix space issues but sparks controversy over scale.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWarehouse and distribution center operators are using artificial intelligence and automation technologies to improve the effectiveness of their facilities in a number of ways, from managing vendors coming in and out of their buildings to maintaining assets.\n\nSkeens Warehouse Services, a third-party facility support firm based in Indiana, said it has partnered with CMMS provider Facilio to streamline how it manages work orders and communicates with vendors.\n\n\"What used to take multiple tools, emails and manual steps is now streamlined and fully visible in one place,\u201d said Riley Skeens, vice president of operations at Skeens Warehouse Services. \u201cWe've not only eliminated hours of manual coordination but are now better equipped to scale our services for new clients and international expansion.\"\n\nThe implementation of Facilio\u2019s AI-driven Connected CMMS Suite, according to the two companies, automates and integrates how work orders are checked in and out and standardizes the process for submitting quotations and invoices. And it gives facility managers a dedicated portal to submit work orders and track vendor performance.\n\nThe partnership replaces disjointed tools and manual coordination, which had made it difficult to maintain efficiency at scale, the companies said Friday.\n\nAI-driven tools like Facilio\u2019s Connected CMMS suite can also drive maintenance efficiency at warehouses and other industrial facilities, according to Ryan Chan, CEO and founder of UpKeep, a CMMS provider.\n\nBy analyzing data collected from operations, the platforms can help facility managers optimize maintenance rather than wait for assets to break down or rely on repair and replacement schedules.\n\n\u201cThe future of asset operations is, instead of looking at assets at three distinct moments of time, looking at the entire lifecycle,\u201d Chan said during a webinar. \u201cThe asset operations vision is shifting the mindset from looking at maintenance as a cost center to a profit center.\u201d\n\nWhile AI can\u2019t climb ladders or turn wrenches, it can help with data analysis, training and building a knowledge base, according to Chan.\n\nBy using AI, operators can \u201crun simulations of digital plans that will think, learn, respond and give you a digital blueprint of your entire operations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just triggering alerts, it\u2019s looking at the entire detection diagnosis, helping you dispatch the right person and helping you drive a resolution feedback cycle.\u201d\n\nThe systems can also be useful when facility managers are trying to navigate the line between operations that focus on the building and those that focus on the work that\u2019s being done in the building. Being able to manage assets involved in both types of operation is especially important in warehouse and distribution center settings because these types of operations rely heavily on the physical building, from dock doors to storage areas. That makes strategically planning and managing the layout of facilities to optimize space paramount.\n\nFacility operators that use AI-enabled platforms can realize efficiencies of 20% to 30% in inventory management, a 5% to 20% cut in logistics costs and up to 15% drop in procurement spend, according to a November 2024 analysis by McKinsey.\n\n\u201cUsing a highly granular approach, the system evaluates the labor and assets (such as forklifts) required to complete warehouse operations on an hour-by-hour basis and analyzes the impact of variability in demand and resource availability,\u201d McKinsey said in its report. \u201cThis helps the company understand the true capacity of its facilities and improves decision making by accurately predicting the impact of changes in labor, assets, or material flows.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "Facility managers at higher education campuses can expect better quality and lower maintenance needs if new dormitories and other student housing use modular construction, a general contractor experienced in that method says.\n\nModular construction is used mostly for affordable housing as a way to bring new units to market at a lower cost, but universities and colleges are looking at it more, according to Jim Stanley, executive vice president and Los Angeles division manager of Suffolk Construction, a builder that operates across the U.S.\n\nA good example is California Polytechnic State University, which plans to bring online some 3,000 beds over 10 years to house the school\u2019s growing student base at a lower cost than stick-built housing while keeping the design aligned to the school\u2019s historical structures, he said.\n\n\u201cEspecially with a renowned university like Cal Poly, they want it to be an experience for the student, and they have some historical buildings, so you\u2019re competing with older student housing and you want it to still be a positive experience,\u201d he said.\n\nModular construction has evolved to include units that can have relatively sophisticated designs without sacrificing the value proposition it offers by simplifying and standardizing the base component, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen quite a few modular jobs that have [ornamental] projections where the [modules] get stacked,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the actual box itself has to be enhanced in order to handle some of these things.\u201d\n\nModular building manufacturers have evolved two types of business models, Stanley said. They either build each modular unit from scratch or they act as an assembly line and contract with other manufacturers to produce pieces of the unit.\n\n\u201cThey might outsource the frame construction, the wall panel construction and the bathroom pod \u2014 similar to how a car is made,\u201d he said.\n\nCal Poly could expect to get the main structure for a 100-unit building completed in seven days \u2014 30% quicker than if stick-built \u2014 using the modular method, with roughly corresponding savings in cost, Stanley said.\n\n\u201cYes, I still have to scaffold it and roof it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to put the facade on the skin, and there\u2019s still work that has to happen, but the structure gets topped out, plus the interior fitted out\u201d in that shorter time frame.\n\nA residential building under construction using modular components. Courtesy of Suffolk\n\nOnce the modular units are stacked by a crane, workers can come in and, relatively quickly, connect the plumbing, electrical and mechanical infrastructure of the individual units to the main system, he said.\n\nFor the electrical, \u201call I have to do, once the mod gets set, is run my main feeder to that [central] panel, and then everything else is already distributed from that point,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a plumbing perspective \u2026 if I have a stack that\u2019s a riser, and it overlays on the mod below and [the one] just above it, I have about 18 inches of new pipe that I have to install to connect point A to point B, in theory, at the floor and at the ceiling to the next unit above, and it just goes straight up and down vertically\u2026. Same with mechanical. It\u2019s very self-contained in the unit.\u201d\n\nFor facility managers who are charged with maintaining the buildings after they\u2019re put in operation, modular construction can result in fewer problems because each unit is built in a manufacturing plant to uniform standards subject to on-site quality control inspections before it\u2019s sent to the construction site, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I am building the same unit over and over, 100 times, and I have the same person doing the same task 100 times, and I have a [quality control] checklist that I go through to say this happened, this happened -\u2013 literally check those boxes [\u2013 then, in theory, there\u2019s a lot more control,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to have a plumbing trap missing, for instance.\u201d\n\nSuffolk focuses mainly on stick-built multifamily housing in the $40 million-plus range, but it has also developed expertise in projects with a modular component, Stanley said. It contracts with manufacturers to build the units to the client\u2019s specifications with its input and oversight.\n\n\u201cWe send a Suffolk representative to the plant to do a lot of hand-holding,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality of the mod, ultimately, is the quality of the job because we own the end product, so it behooves us to [oversee] their production.\u201d\n\nCosts for modular construction should come down as client institutions, manufacturers, component makers and contractors refine best practices, he said. Modular construction could also be applied to building types other than housing. In a campus setting, that could mean classrooms and labs.\n\n\u201cSome K-12 schools are experimenting with modular-built classrooms and other buildings, but at the college level, expanding beyond housing remains mainly in the conversation stage,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar yet with anything actually being built.\u201d\n\nBut the economics of construction are driving clients and industry executives to include modular construction in the conversation, he said.\n\n\u201cI look at modular as a solution to a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have increased cost of materials, skilled labor shortages\u201d among the factors affecting on-site construction. With modular, \u201cYou\u2019re taking a lot of variables and putting them into a manufacturing environment.\u2026 That\u2019s where I see [construction] trending.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Modular Construction Offers Universities Faster, Cheaper Dorms with Better Quality\n\n**Key details:**\nModular construction is evolving to provide higher quality and lower maintenance needs for new student housing. This method can complete main structures significantly quicker, such as a 100-unit building in seven days, 30% faster than traditional stick-built methods, with corresponding cost savings. Modular building manufacturers use two models: building units from scratch or acting as an assembly line, contracting with other manufacturers for components. Units are built in a controlled manufacturing environment, ensuring uniform standards and quality control inspections before shipment. Once stacked, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical infrastructure can be connected quickly due to the self-contained unit design.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nModular construction offers a direct solution to rising material costs and skilled labor shortages impacting traditional construction. This approach allows universities to rapidly expand student housing at a lower cost, improving capital efficiency and project timelines for asset owners. The enhanced quality control in a manufacturing setting promises fewer post-completion maintenance issues, reducing long-term operational expenses for facility managers. This challenges the consensus that cost-effective, quick construction sacrifices quality, suggesting modular can deliver sophisticated designs while maintaining value, potentially shifting investment strategies in real estate development.\n\n**The big picture:**\nModular construction has historically been utilized primarily for affordable housing to accelerate market entry and reduce costs. However, universities and colleges are increasingly exploring this method for new student housing projects. The overall economics of construction, characterized by escalating material expenses and a scarcity of skilled labor, are compelling clients and industry leaders to adopt modular solutions.

Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are expected to spend over $300 billion this year alone on data centers and compute power.\n\nTechnology adoption remains a critical barrier to the delivery of these projects, according to Revizto research, which found that many construction teams still rely on static, nonintegrated tools even for complex and fast-moving projects. The firm said 27% of global AEC professionals use email, spreadsheets and PDFs as their primary digital tools.\n\nHowever, data center construction demands complex coordination, massive datasets, strict regulatory compliance, high-stakes communication and tight timeframes, with some projects now moving from concept to full design in as little as 10 weeks, according to the white paper.\n\n\"The construction industry can't keep pace with demand using static tools like Excel and PDFs,\u201d said Revizto CEO Arman Gukasyan in a news release. \u201cIf we're serious about meeting the demands of modern data center builds, we need a fundamental shift in how we deliver the physical infrastructure that supports them.\"\n\nBeyond technology adoption, U.S. contractors are finding creative ways to meet the demand for data center development. For instance, contractors are consulting with clients on projects earlier than ever in the process to help evaluate site conditions, entitlement risks, energy procurement and utility interconnection timelines.\n\n\u201cPreconstruction services and capabilities have become a true differentiator,\u201d John Arcello, advanced technology core market co-leader at Redwood City, California-based general contractor DPR, told Construction Dive earlier this year. \u201cEarly engagement is critical to stay on track.\u201d\n\nContractors also are turning to prefabrication more aggressively. On remote sites, Arcello said teams are increasingly building components offsite in labor-rich regions and transporting them to projects. That helps ease skilled trade constraints and minimize rework, he said.\n\nIke Keene, vice president of commercial at Caddell Construction, a Montgomery, Alabama-based general contractor, said that the need for accurate cost forecasting has grown significantly.

        "summary_text": "Thermostats are the controls behind the HVAC equipment, the biggest energy consumer in most buildings.\n\nTemperature control is the key role of a thermostat, but commercial-grade thermostats must also enable energy efficiency, serviceability, multi-site deployment, system diagnostics and cost controls.\n\nHere are the key attributes that must be considered when selecting a thermostat for your buildings:\n\nOptimized Scheduling: Advanced thermostats support detailed scheduling based on occupancy and time of day, reducing energy waste during unoccupied hours.\n\nSmart Setbacks: Automatically adjusts setpoints to balance comfort and savings.\n\nHumidity is Important: Clearly thermostats are designed to control the temperature in a space however, a great deal of comfort experienced is derived from the right level of humidity. The ability to measure and control humidity is important.\n\nReturn and Supply Duct Temperatures: Comparing the room temperature to the supply and return duct temperatures provides an excellent way of assessing the effectiveness and the health of HVAC systems.\n\nRemote Operations and Local Leeway: Managing many buildings requires that various parameters such as temperature and detailed scheduling are specified over the cloud. However, the occupants of a building must have the capability to control those parameters via \u201coverrides\u201d in a limited range and for a limited period.\n\nOptimal Start and Stop Settings: Any air-conditioned space possesses certain characteristics such as the period that it takes to cool or heat the space. Sophisticated thermostats are equipped with parameters that would allow the system to automatically adjust when the HVAC must start to provide optimal comfort. Likewise, if the space is within an appropriate temperature range, depending on the outside temperature and other related factors, the thermostat should be able to decide to stop conditioning the space to improve efficiency.\n\nPeak Power Management: Peak power management is an important strategy for reducing electricity bills. Thermostat must be able to adjust setpoints or cycling to reduce peak demand charges.\n\nGlobal Commissioning and Fleet Management: Facility managers can monitor and adjust HVAC systems remotely through the cloud, which is essential for managing multiple buildings or large campuses.\n\nWeb Portal with Tiered User Access: For a broad set of control points and locations, it is critical to provide different permission levels for users (e.g., admin, technician, guest), with audit logs of changes.\n\nHeat Pumps, Multi-stage HVAC Systems: The type of HVAC system is often driven by the building, the climate and the age of the system. It is important to make sure that the same thermostat can manage a range of system types.\n\nServiceability: HVAC equipment is by far the largest cost center for service. It is important to consider the servicing costs along with electricity costs and provide accurate records for any service performed on the equipment.\n\nOver-the-Air Software Updates: As HVAC systems evolve and the requirements imposed on the thermostat change, it is critical that the thermostat is regularly updated to keep up with such changes. This must be accomplished remotely and seamlessly using secure over-the-air software updates.\n\nIntegrated Approach to All Building Energy Consumers: While HVAC equipment is often the largest energy consumer in a building, lighting and other appliances consume a significant amount of energy as well. Integrating the operation of various energy consumers in the building under one control umbrella provides a broader set of opportunities for operational excellence at reduced operating costs.\n\nSensors Everywhere: Door monitors, occupancy sensors, air quality sensors and light sensors are all part of providing more information to the thermostat to do its job more effectively.\n\nEnergy Usage Reports: Tracks historical HVAC runtime and energy consumption; helps facility managers identify inefficiencies.\n\nReal-Time Fault Detection & Diagnostics: Detects system anomalies and alerts maintenance teams, reducing downtime and repair costs.\n\nCarbon Footprint Tracking: Some models calculate and report CO\u2082 emissions associated with HVAC usage.",

Introduced in the late 1970s, the style saw a 121% increase in demand in Q2 due in part to musician Harry Styles and model Bella Hadid, both of whom wore the shorts.\n\n\u201cWith an accessible price point and multiple variations of the style available both new and on resale platforms, athletic shorts are a key trend this Summer,\u201d said Lyst. The platform saw a 78% increase in searches for \u201csport shorts\u201d in the second quarter.\n\nBrand names gaining in popularity outside of Lyst\u2019s top 20 rankings included Pucci, which saw searches increase 96% quarter on quarter. Amsterdam-based minimalist label Rohe also saw increased interest, with searches up 27% quarter over quarter. Eyewear brand Jacques Marie Mage saw a 34% boost from May to June, per Lyst, which attributed the increase to \u201cthe rising value placed on accessories that carry narrative and craftsmanship, beyond just branding.\u201d\n\nLyst is an online shopping discovery platform. The company has reported on trends since 2018 and its quarterly index ranks fashion\u2019s top brands and items over a three-month period.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Miu Miu Tops Fashion Brands; Footwear and Accessible Luxuries Dominate.\n\n**Key details:** Miu Miu overtook Loewe to become the hottest fashion brand globally in the second quarter 2025 Lyst Index. The Prada Group-owned brand also had the fourth hottest product with its suede loafer. The Row rose to its highest ranking ever, and its Dune flip flop was the quarter's hottest product. Footwear was a major trend, with six of the period's 10 hottest products being shoes. Shoppers turned to lower-lift, high-impact accessories and footwear amid tightening budgets.\n\n**Why it matters:** This shift highlights consumer prioritization of accessible luxury and high-impact accessories like footwear over more expensive items. The strong performance of \"miniature buys\" suggests a potential challenge to the traditional luxury market's reliance on large, costly apparel. It indicates that emotional resonance and identity expression can be achieved without significant financial commitment, especially with mass-market brands appearing in top rankings. This may signal a re-evaluation of product focus for both luxury and mainstream companies.\n\n**The big picture:** The Lyst Index, compiled by an online shopping discovery platform, has been tracking fashion trends quarterly since 2018. The index ranks top brands and items over a three-month period based on factors including social media mentions, consumer searches, product views, and sales. The latest report identifies a trend where consumers, facing tightening budgets, are increasingly opting for smaller, more accessible purchases that still offer emotional resonance and express identity.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Miu Miu: #1 hottest brand in Q2 2025 Lyst Index.\n*   The Row's Dune flip flop: Q2's hottest product, with searches up 162% quarter-over-quarter.\n*   Footwear: Comprised six of the quarter's 10 hottest products.\n*   Adidas Adicolor Sprinter Short: 3rd hottest product, with demand up 121% in Q2.\n*   Pucci searches: Increased 96% quarter on quarter.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Miu Miu: Prada Group-owned brand that became the hottest fashion brand globally.\n*   Loewe: Luxury brand that became the second hottest, surpassed by Miu Miu.\n*   Prada Group: Owner of Miu Miu, which now ranks as the world's hottest fashion brand.\n*   Tapestry: Parent company of Coach, which dropped from fourth to fifth place.\n*   The Row: Achieved its highest ranking, fueled by its Dune flip flop as the hottest product.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for the release of the next quarterly Lyst Index report.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Accessible luxury and footwear are reshaping the fashion landscape amid budget shifts.",

The brand\u2019s first retail concept will open in Raleigh, North Carolina, in October.\n\nMaeve currently has dedicated retail space within Anthropologie\u2019s stores and has become the top-searched brand on Anthropologie\u2019s website over the past year. Its product assortment \u201cblends timeless silhouettes with modern details,\u201d features plus, petite, tall and adaptive options, and targets a \u201cmultigenerational audience,\u201d according to Anthropologie.\n\nTo kick off the launch, Anthropologie is rolling out a robust marketing strategy. This includes an ad campaign across digital and physical channels, a Maeve catalog that will be shipped to top customers, a Substack newsletter, and an in-person event in New York City featuring a mock store preview and product unveilings.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs an owned brand, Maeve became a growth driver and developed a loyal customer base, which sowed the seeds for this transition, according to Anthropologie. Over the past year, almost 2 million customers have shopped Maeve products and the brand has accumulated more than 10 million TikTok views, per the release.\n\n\u201cIts consistent performance, combined with our customers\u2019 emotional connection to the brand, made this the right moment to evolve Maeve into a stand-alone identity,\u201d Anu Narayanan, president of women\u2019s and home at Anthropologie Group, said in a statement. \u201cOur customers have helped shape Maeve into what it is today and shown us time and again that the label holds a special place in both their wardrobes and their lives.\u201d\n\nPrior to introducing Maeve as a stand-alone brand, Anthropologie has expanded in other ways. In January, the retailer unveiled resortwear line Celandine, complete with swimwear, cover-ups, dresses, accessories and beauty products. Two months later, Anthropologie partnered with Universal Standard to create a 13-piece collection, including shirts, jeans, a jumpsuit and dresses.\n\nThose efforts are paying off, according to Frank Conforti, COO and co-president of parent company Urban Outfitters Inc. On an earnings call with analysts in May, Conforti noted that both brick-and-mortar and digital channels drove growth for Anthropologie and praised the segment\u2019s product assortment.\n\n\u201cThe team at Anthropologie continues to do an excellent job with their strategy to expand their product offerings to fit their customers\u2019 full lifestyle,\u201d Conforti said, adding that the launch of Celandine had already \u201cexceeded our expectations. Alongside Celandine, Daily Practice and the expanded assortment of intimates and loungewear are also seeing impressive growth, and we believe these could become significant categories in the future.\u201d\n\nAnthropologie\u2019s net sales in the quarter rose 8.3% year over year, with comparable sales up 6.9%. Urban Outfitters Inc. reported a 10.7% jump in net sales for the quarter, to $1.3 billion.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPresident Donald Trump has employed several powers of the executive branch to enact a wide range of tariffs, including country-specific levies scheduled to return Aug. 1. However, Trump's future use of tariffs as a negotiating tool is likely to be determined in the courts, where several states and businesses plan to argue that he lacks the statutory authority to impose sweeping tariffs on all countries that trade with the U.S.\n\nOne of the critical proceedings challenging Trump's tariff use began Thursday. The administration is facing off against lawyers from five companies and 12 states before 11 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The court will decide whether to lift its stay of a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that blocked Trump's broad use of duties, including a global 10% baseline tariff and various other country-specific levies, without congressional approval.\n\nThe case, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v Trump, is one of several lawsuits with plaintiffs fighting tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Here\u2019s a look at five such cases and where they currently stand:\n\nOn April 14, V.O.S. Selections and four other import companies sued the Trump administration in the USCIT, claiming the president exceeded his statutory authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by imposing tariffs without congressional authorization.\n\nThe plaintiffs also claimed that the tariffs hurt them financially by increasing costs and disrupting their operations.\n\nOn April 23, 12 states filed a parallel lawsuit, mainly making the same arguments. So, the USCIT consolidated the two cases, and a three-judge panel ruled on May 28 that the president had no authority to impose across-the-board tariffs under the IEEPA. As a result of the findings, the USCIT issued a permanent injunction against future tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which issued a temporary stay on the injunction while considering the appeal. Oral arguments for the case are scheduled to begin Thursday.\n\nThe hearing is unusual because all 11 judges will hear arguments en banc, instead of via a more typical three-judge panel. An en banc hearing is reserved for cases of exceptional importance and indicates the judges want a ruling reflecting the view of the entire court.\n\nOn April 22, Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc., two small businesses specializing in educational products, filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump's tariffs under the IEEPA.\n\nA judge from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction on May 29, preventing the Trump administration from collecting IEEPA tariffs from the two plaintiffs. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (CADC) granted the administration's request for a stay until it could rule on the case's merits.\n\nOn April 16, California sued Trump in the U.S. District Court of Northern California, challenging the president's authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA. The suit alleges the tariffs exceed Trump's presidential authority and have caused significant harm to California's economy, businesses and consumers.\n\nA District Court judge in June dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the suit belonged in the USCIT. California then sought appellate review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A decision is pending.\n\nOn April 11, Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard, both citizens of the Blackfeet Nation, sued the U.S. and the U.S. Homeland Security Department, challenging executive orders and proclamations that imposed new tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from Canada. The plaintiffs filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the tariff orders, claiming they exceeded presidential and statutory authority under the IEEPA and Trade Expansion Act. The suit also claimed no clear foreign threat justified the sweeping tariffs, as the Trump administration claimed.\n\nThe case also says that Trump's actions breach two treaties signed by the U.S. government: the 1794 Jay Treaty and the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, which exempted indigenous trade from duties, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe district court granted the government's request to transfer the case to the USCIT on April 25, ruling the suit belonged in the specialized court. The plaintiffs appealed the transfer order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied the request.\n\nOn May 16, Axle of Dearborn, which does business as Detroit Axle, filed a lawsuit in the USCIT against the Commerce Department and three other federal agencies, challenging the legality of several executive orders eliminating the de minimis exemption.\n\nThe Michigan-based automotive parts distributor argues that the president lacks the statutory and constitutional authority to revoke the exemption, which allows duty-free importation of goods valued at less than $800. The company called on the court to block multiple executive orders implementing tariffs and banning the exemption.\n\nThe government argues that the president has the power under the IEEPA and the U.S. Constitution to take \"emergency\" actions, including withdrawing the de minimis exemption as part of a response to international trade threats.\n\nThe Trump administration requested a halt to the proceedings until the V.O.S. Selections case is resolved. On July 28, the USCIT granted the stay.",

The fine stems from an investigation that was launched last year by the Italian Competition Authority, a regulator known as the ACGM.\n\nThe investigation found that Shein\u2019s claims in the \u201c#SHEINTHEKNOW,\u201d \u201cevoluSHEIN,\u201d and \u201cSocial Responsibility\u201d sections of the company\u2019s website included statements that were vague, generic and overly emphatic, and that, in other cases, Shein omitted or gave misleading information, according to a press release from the Italian agency on Monday.\n\nOn the same day as the AGCM announcement, Shein separately released plans to lower supply chain emissions at its warehousing and logistics operations in China and divert waste from landfills.\n\nItaly\u2019s investigation into the company began in September 2024, when the competition regulator said that consumers had an increased interest in the impact of their consumption choices on the environment.\n\nThe investigation took issue with Shein\u2019s claims related to circular design and product recyclability, which the AGCM said were false or confusing.\n\nThe fast fashion company\u2019s promotion of the \u201cevoluSHEIN\u201d clothing line used the term \u201cgreen fibers\u201d without clearly indicating the environmental benefits of the products, and Shein didn\u2019t specify that the line is marginal compared to all of its other products, according to AGCM. The claims also could lead consumers to believe that the collection is entirely recyclable, which is untrue.\n\nIn Shein\u2019s Social Responsibility section, the fast fashion company\u2019s claims that it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050 are generic and vague. The Italian authority said that these figures were contradicted by Shein\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions rising in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cWe have cooperated fully with the AGCM throughout this process and took immediate action to address the concerns raised as soon as we became aware of them,\u201d a Shein spokesperson said in an email. \u201cWe have strengthened our internal review processes and improved our website to ensure that all environmental claims are clear, specific, and compliant with regulation.\u201d\n\nIn a different announcement on Monday, Shein said it was integrating new energy vehicles into its interwarehouse transportation system in China.\n\nThe fast fashion company is developing a 9.6-meter electric vehicle that will work as an alternative to its current fleet of 6-meter diesel trucks. Shein said it was working with several logistics and technology partners to develop the vehicle, but it didn\u2019t identify them.\n\nThis year Shein plans to deploy more than 130 vehicles across its warehousing and logistics operations in China. This plan, the company said, could lead to a nearly 10,000 metric tons reduction of carbon dioxide annually, and create cost savings of 20% to 30% compared to diesel vehicle operations.\n\nShein said its logistics model, which involves frequent short-distance trips and lightweight items, makes it well-suited to pilot and scale electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cSHEIN recognises that more needs to be done to better manage its impact on natural resources and the environment and is actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with partners across the industry to drive further progress,\u201d the company said in the release.\n\nIn addition to the new energy vehicles, Shein said it would implement other measures to enhance its logistics efficiency.\n\nShein plans to optimize its global logistics network with route planning for multimodal routes to reduce emissions. It also plans to optimize air freight capacity by developing new loading frames and introducing lighter, reusable gunny sacks to reduce packaging weight.\n\nThe company said it would expand its use of electric delivery vehicles in regions such as Europe, and promote self pick-up locations where available.\n\nIn addition, Shein announced that four of its managed facilities achieved a Zero Waste to Landfill certification, bringing the total of Shein facilities with this certification to seven.\n\n\u201cBy gradually standardizing the waste treatment methods at its self-operated facilities, SHEIN has implemented a range of waste management processes that have helped all seven of its zero waste to landfill certified sites to achieve an average waste diversion rate of 99.59%, including energy recovery,\u201d the company said in the release. \u201cThis means that almost all of the waste generated at the certified sites is reduced, reused, recycled or converted into energy.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Shein fined for 'greenwashing' claims; announces new sustainability push**\n\n**Key details:**\nShein was fined 1 million euros ($1.16 million) by the Italian government for using misleading environmental claims in clothing promotion. The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) found Shein\u2019s website statements were vague, generic, or contained misleading information. Specifically, claims about the \u201cevoluSHEIN\u201d line and future emission reductions were deemed false or contradictory. On the same day, Shein separately announced plans to lower supply chain emissions at its warehousing and logistics operations in China and divert waste from landfills. These plans include deploying electric vehicles and optimizing global logistics networks.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe fine highlights increasing regulatory scrutiny on \"greenwashing\" in the fast fashion industry. It signals that vague or unsubstantiated environmental claims can lead to significant penalties. The AGCM explicitly stated Shein\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions rising in 2023 and 2024 contradicted its previous reduction targets. This directly challenges any perception that Shein was on track with its prior, stated emissions goals. Shein's immediate new sustainability announcements could be seen as an effort to regain trust amidst these findings.\n\n**The big picture:**\nItaly's investigation began in September 2024 due to increased consumer interest in environmental consumption impact. The probe specifically targeted Shein\u2019s claims on circular design, product recyclability, and terms like \"green fibers.\" The AGCM found the \"evoluSHEIN\" line's \"green fibers\" term lacked clear environmental benefits and its marginality was not specified. Shein's previous claims of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2030 and eliminating them entirely by 2050 were found generic and contradicted by rising actual emissions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Fine: 1 million euros ($1.16 million)\n*   Planned new energy vehicle deployment: More than 130 vehicles in China this year\n*   Potential annual CO2 reduction from new vehicles: Nearly 10,000 metric tons\n*   Cost savings from new vehicles: 20% to 30% compared to diesel\n*   Total Zero Waste to Landfill certified facilities: 7 (including 4 newly certified)\n*   Waste diversion rate at certified sites: 99.59%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Shein:** Fast fashion company fined by Italy for misleading environmental claims and announcing new sustainability plans.\n*   **Italian government:** Imposed a 1 million euro fine on Shein for its misleading environmental marketing practices.\n*   **Italian Competition Authority (AGCM):** Regulator that investigated Shein's environmental claims and issued the fine.\n*   **Shein spokesperson:** Stated the company cooperated fully and took immediate action to address the raised concerns.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Deployment of more than 130 new energy vehicles in Shein's China warehousing and logistics operations this year.\n*   Expansion of electric delivery vehicles in Europe and promotion of self-pick-up locations.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nShein fined for greenwashing; new sustainability plans aim to address regulatory scrutiny.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAdidas is set to steal market share from Nike this year as its rival navigates a turnaround and a tariff-fueled economy. That\u2019s according to a GlobalData analysis, which sees Adidas as one of the biggest winners in the global apparel market in 2025.\n\nLast year, Nike held 2.9% of the global apparel market, 1.1 percentage points higher than Adidas. In 2025, that\u2019s expected to decline by 0.3 percentage points, at the same time that Adidas\u2019 share grows by 0.1 percentage point.\n\nOther share gainers in apparel this year will be Shein, Uniqlo, Skechers and New Balance, according to GlobalData\u2019s forecast. Puma, which just reported a Q2 sales decline and slashed its full-year forecast due to tariffs and soft sales trends, is expected to lose share, alongside H&M and Louis Vuitton.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe upheaval caused by the Trump administration\u2019s ever-changing tariff policies is impacting all retailers in one way or another, though apparel is one of the hardest-hit sectors. Within that segment, retailers are raising prices and shifting production to cut down on costs, all while navigating a wary consumer.\n\n\u201cBrands that can quickly react to trends and offer good value for money will have the opportunity to gain share, whereas those that are unable to compete on price or style are forecast to lose out,\u201d Tom Ljubojevic, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement.\n\nStyle is one of the reasons Adidas is forecast to win, with GlobalData citing the success of its Originals line and performance footwear in the current environment. Adidas just this week reported sales growth of 2% in Q2 and said it expects style preferences to continue to work in its favor. Nike, on the other hand, is struggling under the weight of lackluster innovation and the need to cut down on core franchises.\n\n\u201cElsewhere within sportswear, New Balance and Skechers are also expected to gain share, bolstered by their versatility, alongside their high-profile athlete and brand partnerships,\u201d Ljubojevic said.\n\nSkechers has been on a tear recently, expanding into categories including soccer cleats and basketball shoes, alongside a robust brand ambassador strategy. Among others, Skechers has signed Harry Kane, Julius Randle, Terance Mann, OG Anunoby, Bernhard Langer and Kiki Iriafen. The footwear brand also recently signed a deal to sell itself to 3G Capital for $9.4 billion.\n\nAlthough Shein will gain share again this year, that growth is slowing now \u201cdue to its established presence,\u201d GlobalData said. Low prices and quick action on trends are helping the brand outshine others in apparel, though, including H&M and Zara.",

Puma, H&M, and Louis Vuitton are forecast to lose share.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters as Adidas is positioned to gain share while Nike struggles with innovation and core franchises, potentially challenging Nike's long-standing market leadership.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTapestry completed the sale of Stuart Weitzman to Caleres, the company said Monday.\n\nCaleres bought the brand for $120.2 million, including $11.5 million in cash received at closing, according to a news release from Caleres.\n\nThe deal was initially announced in February . With the footwear brand out of its portfolio, Tapestry has freed up space to focus on its other larger brands: Coach and Kate Spade.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTapestry first acquired Stuart Weitzman in 2015 for about $530 million, a stark difference from the current sale price to Caleres.\n\nLike Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman saw consistent revenue declines during Tapestry\u2019s earnings results, while the larger Coach brand drove much of the company\u2019s recent growth. Stuart Weitzman represented about 3% of Tapestry\u2019s total sales.\n\nIn February, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said Coach and Kate Spade offered the company more \u201cvalue creation opportunities\u201d and were positioned for long-term success.\n\nIn Tapestry\u2019s most recent earnings report, Stuart Weitzman\u2019s revenue fell 18% to $46 million, while the company\u2019s overall revenue grew 7% year over year, led by Coach. Tapestry is set to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug. 14.\n\n\u201cStuart Weitzman was never successful under Tapestry\u2019s ownership and has been declining,\u201d David Swartz, senior equity analyst for Morningstar Research Services, said in an email. \u201cAs a luxury footwear brand, it didn\u2019t fit well with Coach and Kate Spade since they are primarily handbag brands. As suggested by the low price that Tapestry received for it, there was no real plan to fix Stuart Weitzman, and it has mostly just been a distraction.\u201d\n\nWhile selling Stuart Weitzman was probably the right move for Tapestry, Swartz said it still represents a disappointment for the company, which once looked to be a luxury conglomerate with plans to acquire Capri Holdings. Those plans were dashed after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, and the companies terminated the agreement last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit risky since Tapestry isn\u2019t diversified,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cCoach has been doing great lately, but Tapestry would be in trouble if it cooled off for any reason.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile for Caleres, the Stuart Weitzman deal offers Caleres further expansion in the global footwear market. Caleres also owns Famous Footwear, Sam Edelman and Allen Edmonds.\n\nJonathan Lelonek, who most recently served as senior vice president for Stuart Weitzman wholesale, will become Stuart Weitzman brand president, per Caleres\u2019 release.\n\n\u201cWith the addition of Stuart Weitzman, our Brand Portfolio segment will represent nearly half of our total revenue going forward,\u201d said Jay Schmidt, president and CEO of Caleres. \u201cAs we integrate this iconic brand, we remain committed to preserving the artistry, quality and renowned fit at the brand\u2019s core.\u201d\n\nIn May, publicly traded Caleres reported Q1 sales of $614.2 million, down 6.8% year over year and below its expectations. At the time, Schmidt said that despite the challenging operating environment, the company would redouble its efforts to drive growth and profitability.",

Caleres acquired the brand for $120.2 million, which included $11.5 million in cash received at closing. This transaction, initially announced in February, sees Jonathan Lelonek appointed as the new Stuart Weitzman brand president.\n\n**Why it matters:** The sale allows Tapestry to concentrate on its larger Coach and Kate Spade brands, which offer more value creation opportunities. Stuart Weitzman had consistently declined under Tapestry\u2019s ownership, representing a disappointment for a company that once sought to be a luxury conglomerate. This move highlights Tapestry's increased reliance on Coach, creating risk if that brand cools off. For Caleres, the acquisition expands its global footwear market presence, with the brand expected to represent nearly half of its Brand Portfolio segment.\n\n**The big picture:** Tapestry initially acquired Stuart Weitzman in 2015 for approximately $530 million, significantly more than the current sale price. The brand experienced consistent revenue declines under Tapestry, unlike the growth driven by Coach. This divestiture follows Tapestry's failed attempt to acquire Capri Holdings, which would have diversified its portfolio. For Caleres, the deal comes after reporting Q1 sales that fell below expectations.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$120.2 million:** Sale price for Stuart Weitzman to Caleres.\n*   **About $530 million:** Tapestry's original acquisition price for Stuart Weitzman in 2015.\n*   **18%:** Decline in Stuart Weitzman\u2019s revenue to $46 million in Tapestry\u2019s most recent earnings report.\n*   **3%:** Approximate share of Tapestry's total sales represented by Stuart Weitzman.\n*   **$614.2 million:** Caleres' Q1 sales, which were down 6.8% year over year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Tapestry:** Completed the sale of its Stuart Weitzman brand to Caleres.\n*   **Caleres:** Acquired the Stuart Weitzman brand for $120.2 million.\n*   **Stuart Weitzman:** Footwear brand sold by Tapestry after consistent revenue declines.\n*   **Coach:** Tapestry's larger brand that is driving the company's recent growth.\n*   **Kate Spade:** Tapestry brand offering value creation opportunities, a new focus area.\n*   **Joanne Crevoiserat:** Tapestry CEO who noted Coach and Kate Spade's value potential.\n*   **David Swartz:** Morningstar analyst who commented on Stuart Weitzman's poor fit with Tapestry.\n*   **Capri Holdings:** Company whose acquisition by Tapestry was blocked by the FTC.\n*   **Jonathan Lelonek:** Appointed as the new Stuart Weitzman brand president under Caleres.\n*   **Jay Schmidt:** Caleres President and CEO, who commented on the acquisition and Q1 results.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Tapestry is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2025 earnings on August 14.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Tapestry sheds declining brand at a loss, freeing focus for core.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nJil Sander CEO and OTB Group Chief Strategy Officer Serge Brunschwig exited the company on Thursday, according to an email from an OTB Group spokesperson.\n\nBrunschwig, who assumed both roles in February , left for personal reasons, according to the spokesperson. OTB CEO Ubaldo Minelli will take over Brunschwig\u2019s responsibilities, including the role of CEO of Jil Sander.\n\nMinelli, who has been OTB\u2019s CEO since 2018 , was concurrently Jil Sander CEO from 2021, when OTB acquired the brand, to 2023 when Luca Lo Curzio became CEO .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBrunschwig, who succeeded Lo Curzio at Jil Sander, stepped into his roles at OTB and Jil Sander about three weeks before the brand\u2019s co-creative directors, Lucie and Luke Meier, exited the brand. They had been in their roles since 2017 and were succeeded in March by former Bally creative director Simone Bellotti.\n\n\u201cJil Sander remains fully committed to ensuring strategic and operational continuity, in alignment with its business objectives and the commitments made to clients, business partners, and stakeholders,\u201d the spokesperson told Fashion Dive.\n\nPrior to joining OTB, Brunschwig served in leadership roles over the years at LVMH, including as CEO and president of Fendi, president of Dior Homme, COO of Christian Dior Couture and CEO of Celine.\n\nMeanwhile, Minelli has spent more than 25 years at OTB. From 2015 to 2020, he was CEO of Marni. Since 1998, he also has been CEO of OTB-owned Staff International. All CEOs at OTB report directly to him.\n\nThere have been two other major creative changes at OTB brands since the end of 2024.\n\nIn December, designer John Galliano announced he would leave Maison Margiela after 10 years with the label. He was succeeded by Glenn Martens at the end of January. Martens, formerly creative director of the now-shuttered brand Y/Project, is also creative director of OTB-owned denim label Diesel, a role he has held since 2020.\n\nOTB also saw the departure of Marni creative director Francesco Risso, who left in June after nearly a decade at the brand. He was succeeded last month by Meryll Rogge, who previously worked at labels including Marc Jacobs and Dries Van Noten.\n\nOTB, which reports annually, posted a fiscal 2024 net sales decrease of nearly 5% to 1.7 billion euros, or about $1.78 billion in February. OTB, which also owns Viktor&Rolf and Brave Kid, attributed the revenue decline to an industry-wide wholesale slowdown and said the company planned to focus on expanding its DTC channel.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Jil Sander CEO Exits; OTB Group CEO Minelli Takes Over Key Roles\n\n**Key details:**\nSerge Brunschwig exited his roles as Jil Sander CEO and OTB Group Chief Strategy Officer on Thursday. An OTB Group spokesperson stated his departure was for personal reasons. OTB CEO Ubaldo Minelli will assume Brunschwig\u2019s responsibilities, including the Jil Sander CEO role. Brunschwig had assumed these positions in February, succeeding Luca Lo Curzio as Jil Sander CEO. Minelli previously served as Jil Sander CEO from 2021 to 2023.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis swift executive departure for Serge Brunschwig, who started in February, adds to recent leadership changes at Jil Sander. OTB's CEO Ubaldo Minelli stepping in aims to ensure continuity amid these shifts. This rapid executive turnover, alongside multiple creative director changes across OTB brands, may challenge perceptions of stable operations. It occurs as OTB faces an industry-wide wholesale slowdown and shifts its focus to direct-to-consumer channels. The company spokesperson emphasized commitment to strategic and operational continuity.\n\n**The big picture:**\nOTB Group acquired Jil Sander in 2021, with Ubaldo Minelli initially serving as CEO of the brand. Serge Brunschwig's brief tenure follows Luca Lo Curzio's. Jil Sander also saw its co-creative directors exit shortly after Brunschwig's arrival. This is part of broader leadership changes within OTB, including other creative director departures at Maison Margiela and Marni since the end of 2024. OTB reported a nearly 5% net sales decrease in fiscal 2024 due to an industry-wide wholesale slowdown, planning to focus on direct-to-consumer sales.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Nearly 5% net sales decrease for OTB in fiscal 2024.\n*   OTB's fiscal 2024 net sales were 1.7 billion euros, or about $1.78 billion.\n*   Serge Brunschwig assumed his roles in February.\n*   Jil Sander's co-creative directors, Lucie and Luke Meier, exited about three weeks after Brunschwig started.\n*   Lucie and Luke Meier had been in their roles since 2017.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Serge Brunschwig:** Exited Jil Sander CEO, OTB Chief Strategy Officer for personal reasons.\n*   **OTB Group:** Parent company managing executive and creative leadership changes across brands.\n*   **Ubaldo Minelli:** OTB CEO assuming Brunschwig\u2019s responsibilities, including Jil Sander CEO.\n*   **Jil Sander:** Brand experiencing recent executive and creative leadership turnover, now led by Minelli.\n*   **Lucie and Luke Meier:** Jil Sander's co-creative directors who exited shortly after Brunschwig joined.\n*   **Simone Bellotti:** Succeeded the Meiers as Jil Sander creative director in March.\n*   **Maison Margiela:** OTB brand where designer John Galliano left after 10 years.\n*   **John Galliano:** Designer who announced he would leave Maison Margiela in December.\n*   **Glenn Martens:** Succeeded John Galliano at Maison Margiela and is creative director of Diesel.\n*   **Marni:** OTB brand where creative director Francesco Risso departed after nearly a decade.\n*   **Francesco Risso:** Marni creative director who left in June after nearly a decade at the brand.\n*   **Meryll Rogge:** Succeeded Francesco Risso as Marni creative director last month.\n*   **Diesel:** OTB-owned denim label with Glenn Martens as creative director since 2020.\n*   **Staff International:** OTB-owned company where Ubaldo Minelli has been CEO since 1998.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nExecutive flux continues at Jil Sander and OTB amid strategic shifts.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nKellanova has teamed with the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) to become the Official Snack of U.S. Soccer, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The partnership is Kellanova North America\u2019s first partnership in sports for its entire snack portfolio, which includes Pringles, Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts, and comes as the company has more than doubled its sports marketing spend since 2018.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest in sports because we see the value it brings \u2014 not only in growing fan engagement and cultural relevance, but also in delivering strong returns on our brand-building efforts,\u201d said Julie Bowerman, chief marketing officer of Kellanova North America, in a statement.\n\nThe partnership comes as the U.S. prepares to host the 2026 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup, as well as the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Soccer fandom has exploded, with first-time fans up more than 400% year-over-year, and it is a \u201ctransformative\u201d time for the sport, said Dan Gaiman, senior vice president of partnership development and strategy at the USSF.\n\n\u201cWe're really focused on finding those brands that are as excited as we are about this moment ahead, and really want to lean in,\u201d Gaiman said. \u201cFrom the shelves to the stadiums, Kellanova can create these joyful moments that connect our fans with the game.\u201d\n\nBrand halo\n\nThe partnership, with the shared tagline \u201cIt Takes a Pack,\u201d will see Kellanova\u2019s brands appear in national advertising, digital and social content and assets feature the company\u2019s brand mascots. The effort also includes retail activations, packaging, in-store displays and purpose-driven events.\n\n\u201cNext year is going to be one of the biggest cultural moments that we're going to see, and it's all around soccer,\u201d said Maggie Gilliam Hoy, senior director of omni capabilities and center of excellence lead at Kellanova. \u201cThere are a lot of dimensions in our partnership that we're going to bring to light.\u201d\n\nThe USSF is the nonprofit governing body of American soccer at international, professional and amateur levels, including the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams, Major League Soccer, the National Women's Soccer League, youth organizations and beyond. Finding the right brand partners for the organization requires an alignment of values.\n\n\u201cBrand halo is really important. We want to work with brands that have a strong national presence [that] can help lift up the sport during such an important time and a commitment to really activating and engaging with our fans,\u201d Gaiman explained.\n\nA fraught playing field\n\nKellanova is the snack-focused business created when the Kellogg Company split off its North American cereal business as WK Kellogg Co in October 2023. Kellanova net sales were approximately $13 billion in 2024, per details from the company. Food giant Mars has made a $36 billion bid to acquire Kellanova but has hit regulatory snags in the EU.\n\nWith or without another corporate restructuring, Kellanova faces a CPG space dealing with changing consumer tastes, tariff-related issues and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amid all of that, the partnership around soccer requires lots of work to build out and activate.\n\n\u201cWe're just staying focused and true to what we're really good at, which is having super strong brands and bringing them to life and working with our retail partners,\u201d Gilliam Hoy said. \u201cWe're sticking to business as usual and driving strong business with our retail partners.\u201d\n\nThe partnership also comes at a time of heightened sensitivity around sociopolitical issues for brands that are sometimes exacerbated by input by President Trump (e.g. American Eagle\u2019s ongoing controversy around a campaign with Sydney Sweeney). The administration\u2019s travel bans and immigration crackdown have raised concerns about the fitness of the U.S. to host international sporting events, including the World Cup and the Olympics \u2014 controversy Kellanova would surely like to avoid.\n\n\u201cThe retail moment and tentpole moment that we're talking about [is bigger than World Cup],\u201d Gilliam Hoy said. \u201cWe're trying to get into that emotional, cultural side that everybody has. Everybody has an experience with soccer.\u201d",

The Department of Health and Human Services said the waivers aim to end the \"subsidization of popular types of junk food.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSNAP consumers make up nearly a quarter of spending in the packaged foods industry, according to Numerator, and new restrictions stand to further limit sales at a time when consumption is already slowing.\n\nRestrictions on benefits also vary by state, adding to the confusion for the food industry. Some states are only banning sodas, while others are targeting energy drinks and candy. Florida is so far the only state to restrict SNAP purchases of prepared desserts.\n\nAdding to the complications, state bans also have different definitions for what's considered candy or sugary drinks.\n\nIndiana and Nebraska, for example, are both banning soft drink purchases but have different definitions of the beverage. Indiana says soft drinks encompass all nonalcoholic beverages with natural or artificial sweeteners, while Nebraska defines them as carbonated nonalcoholic beverages containing water, a sweetening agent, flavoring and carbon dioxide gas.\n\nOther states have even more complexity. Iowa, which has one of the most restrictive set of SNAP rules, is banning sugar-sweetened beverages that contain less than 50% juice, including sodas, energy drinks and flavored waters. The state is also restricting drink concentrates and powdered mix-ins.\n\nIowa is also taking an expansive definition of candy, banning traditional gum and candies in addition to fruit leather, ready-to-eat caramel corn and granola bars unless they contain flour. Trail mix, or other snacks where fruits and nuts are combined with sugar or chocolate, is also banned.\n\nAs some states provide detailed definitions, others remain vague. Arkansas is banning soda and \"unhealthy drinks,\" without providing a description of what the latter entails.\n\nMore states have moved toward restricting SNAP purchases as part of a push from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement. Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP uses \"taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy\u2014products that fuel America\u2019s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.\"\n\n\u201cThese waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,\" Kennedy added.\n\nPurchasing patterns between SNAP households and non-SNAP households are roughly equal, the USDA found, with consumers spending the majority of their dollars on staples like meat, fruits, eggs and bread. More money was spent on soft drinks than any other item across all households, though SNAP users spent somewhat more.\n\nWhile SNAP participants are more likely to have higher rates of obesity, recent research from the National Institutes of Health suggests other factors like poor mental health may be driving unhealthy eating patterns.\n\nThe food industry has long fought efforts to restrict SNAP purchases, arguing that the program addresses hunger and obesity by increasing access to retailers with healthier foods.\n\n\"At a time when many Americans need the temporary assistance available through SNAP, it is more important than ever that policies promote benefit adequacy and access, not introduce unwise complexity or stigma,\" a coalition of industry groups previously wrote to the White House.",

Spillane will remain on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe executive change comes as the beer industry grapples with a downturn in consumption. The sector has struggled as consumers pull back on spending and curtail booze consumption.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBoston Beer saw its stock and sales soar in the late 2010s due largely to demand for its Truly Hard Seltzer. But as consumer tastes have shifted in the alcohol sector, Boston Beer has been among the hardest hit.\n\nDuring its most recent quarter, depletions, or the amount of product the company sold to consumers, decreased 5% from the prior year. Shipment volume for the period was about 2.1 million barrels, a 0.8% decrease from the prior year. This downturn was primarily due to declines in Truly and Samuel Adams brands that were partially offset by growth in Dogfish Head and Sun Cruiser, Boston Beer\u2019s lemonade vodka drink.\n\nKoch told The Wall Street Journal he will remain as CEO until an internal successor is ready. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate doing this in five years,\u201d he told the business publication. \u201cThere are multiple people who are not yet ready, but in a couple of years, one or two of them will be.\u201d\n\nKoch said Spillane is leaving the brewer in a \u201cpretty good situation.\u201d\n\nWhile Koch hasn\u2019t been CEO at Boston Beer for more than two decades, he has been actively involved in the alcohol space and his company since then, often appearing on earnings calls and at industry events. While his return as CEO was unexpected, few are likely as attuned to the inner workings of Boston Beer and the industry as a whole as Koch.\n\n\u201cI am confident in the strength of our management team and Boston Beer\u2019s strategic direction and remain committed to delivering long-term value for shareholders,\u201d Koch said in a press release.\n\nThe shakeup is the latest CEO change at a major alcohol company in recent months. Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley announced in April he is retiring by the end of 2025 after six years leading the company. And last month, Guinness and Johnnie Walker maker Diageo said CEO Debra Crew has stepped down \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d after two years.",

        "summary_text": "Grocers are facing a bevy of incoming SNAP changes from the spending and tax bill President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month and from a handful of states that recently received permission to make select items like candy and soda ineligible for SNAP spending.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed includes $186 billion in SNAP cuts over 10 years, said Stephanie Johnson, group vice president of government relations and political affairs at the National Grocers Association. That cut is mainly tied to altered eligibility requirements that are projected to reduce the number of consumers who can use the food assistance program, Johnson said.\n\nSome of the major changes to SNAP in the tax bill include:\n\nExpanding SNAP eligibility work requirements to include parents with children ages 14 and older and people under age 65 (up from 55).\n\nLimiting SNAP eligibility to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and excluding certain immigrant groups like refugees and people seeking asylum.\n\nEliminating the National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant program, known as SNAP-Ed.\n\nRequiring cost neutrality for the Thrifty Food Plan, which the USDA uses to determine SNAP benefit amounts.\n\nRequiring states starting in fiscal year 2027 to pay 75% of SNAP administration costs instead of splitting with the federal government.\n\nRequiring states starting in fiscal 2028 to pay for SNAP benefits depending on their \u201cerror rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest change in SNAP is attempting to reduce the number of people who qualify,\u201d said John Ross, CEO of the Independent Grocers Alliance, a global network of independently owned grocers.\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA this year started granting waivers to states, allowing them to restrict certain products like candy and soda from SNAP eligibility. States have tried to request waivers through the USDA before, but the agency, on a bipartisan basis, had not approved them, Johnson said.\n\nThe USDA has so far granted waivers to six states, and several others \u2014 West Virginia, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas \u2014 are seeking waivers. The SNAP waivers not only impact retailers and consumers in the states that receive them, but also neighboring states, sources said.\n\nThe flurry of changes comes as retailers look to retain and attract SNAP consumers, whose spending significantly impacts grocers\u2019 bottom lines. SNAP consumers typically have a larger basket than non-SNAP shoppers and are \u201cvery loyal,\u201d Albertsons President and CFO Sharon McCollam said during the company\u2019s earnings call earlier this month.\n\nHere\u2019s what grocers need to know about the likely impacts on consumers and retailers from these latest developments.\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, accompanied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (left), speaks after signing SNAP food choice waivers for Idaho, Utah and Arkansas at the USDA office in Washington, D.C. on June 10, 2025. Andrew Harnik via Getty Images\n\nBracing for impact\n\nAs states implement the changes to participant eligibility in SNAP, grocers may start to see a decrease in SNAP sales over the next six months, Johnson said, noting that the reduction in SNAP participants will carry on for the decade-long period the bill covers and perhaps even longer.\n\nThe NGA estimates that cuts to SNAP eligibility will total $88 billion over the next 10 years as a result of a decrease in SNAP consumers, based on the association\u2019s review of the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of the tax legislation. The NGA forecasts that grocers could see a sales hit of 6.7% on average over the next six months as SNAP participants are removed from the program.\n\nWork requirements are forecast to make the biggest dent in SNAP sales Estimated decrease to SNAP sales through 2034\n\nThe \u201cwild card\u201d facing grocers is how states\u2019 error rates and the shifting costs of SNAP funding may affect grocers, Johnson said. States with error rates at or above 6% will be required to pay a portion of the benefit costs, ranging from 5% to 15%, depending on the error rate. Over the last 20 years, every state except South Dakota has had an error rate above 6% for at least one year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be hard to tell what the impact will be there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt will be dependent on the state's error rates, their budget and other variables.\u201d\n\nWhile states don\u2019t have the authority to reduce the benefit amount that participants receive each month, they do have the flexibility to remove participants through policy changes, Johnson said. That is more likely to happen in states with higher error rates that have trouble squaring the costs of the SNAP program within their state budgets. Maryland is a state with an error rate \u201cthat is on the higher side,\u201d said Cailey Locklair, president of the Maryland Retailers Alliance.\n\nSome grocers will face harder hits from the SNAP changes than others. While SNAP accounts for roughly 12% of grocery sales in the U.S., it can account for less than 1% of sales at a higher-end grocer and more than 60% at a grocer serving low-income urban or rural areas, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cIn some communities in Maryland where there are underserved populations, you're talking about major amounts of money that are theoretically being supplemented by these benefit programs [like SNAP],\u201d Locklair said.\n\nFor stores where more than 30% of their shoppers receive SNAP, a major looming question is whether customers who become ineligible for SNAP with the new changes will be able to subsidize their food spending or will cut back on their spending, said Ross.\n\n\u201cWhen you take one of those stores in rural Georgia, for example, where they're the only grocery store for 60 miles, [when] that store fails, there's nothing left except the convenience store,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAnd what happens in a community where you do not have a grocery store that sells fresh meat and fresh produce is the incidence of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, childhood obesity \u2014 they all go way above the norm.\u201d\n\nSNAP has a \u201cdramatic impact\u201d on the economy, Johnson said. The program supports about 388,000 jobs throughout the food industry and contributes about $20 billion in wages and roughly $4 billion in state and federal taxes, according to an economic analysis earlier this year by NGA.\n\n\u201cMoney from the SNAP customers is going into the workers in the store, which are going and then spending that money moving forward, and so it's a really cyclical economic system,\u201d Johnson said, noting this is especially vital in lower-income communities.\n\nMeanwhile, grocers in states that have received SNAP waivers to restrict the eligibility of certain items, as well as retailers in neighboring states, are waiting to see if the waivers will change how and where SNAP consumers shop, sources said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of concerns about folks moving across state lines [to shop], especially if you're in a city like Kansas City, where the city is basically on the border and you can just go across the river to get your groceries,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSeveral states are looking to restrict certain items from SNAP eligibility Six states have gotten waivers approved while a handful are seeking waivers\n\nIn Indiana, one of the states with a waiver, \u201cit's an hour's drive to the border from anywhere in the state,\u201d which could incentivize consumers to drive to neighboring states to do their grocery shopping, said Joseph Lackey, president of the Indiana Grocery & Convenience Store Association. If that happens, retailers would feel pressured to operate in states that don\u2019t have the restrictions, Lackey said.\n\nA nationally set standard on which items to exclude from SNAP could resolve that issue, Lackey added.\n\n\u201c[Standardized exclusions] would also make it a lot easier instead of people being mad at Indiana and going to Illinois to buy their stuff,\u201d Lackey said.\n\nJohnson said that research is \u201csplit\u201d on whether consumer behavior could change, but noted that grocers are concerned about widespread sales loss.\n\n\u201cOur members near state lines won't just be losing SNAP dollars. They'll also be losing the dollars that often come with SNAP dollars, like when someone purchases toilet paper or other types of things that aren't covered by SNAP,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nGrocers in states that have received waivers are also worried that implementing the changes will be \u201ca large administrative burden\u201d when it comes to the definitions of the restricted items, Johnson said.\n\nState-by-state breakdown of SNAP waivers Items excluded and effective dates for the six states that have received waivers.\n\nCurrent nationwide SNAP restrictions apply to entire categories, such as tobacco and alcohol, rather than individual products, Ross said. Making changes on the category level is much easier in point-of-sales systems than making them for individual items, which is what the state waivers allow, Ross noted.\n\nIf states want to exclude empty calories from SNAP, they may have to make tricky item-by-item decisions for what qualifies, Ross said.\n\n\u201cOkay, Little Debbie cakes are out. What about Kind bars? What about a Nature Valley bar \u2014 [which still has] a lot of sugar in it. Is it going to qualify or not?\u201d Ross said. \u201cSo now all of a sudden, you're having to make judgments at this SKU level about what qualifies or not.\u201d\n\nGrocers may need to consider how to train workers on explaining the SNAP changes to consumers who are confused when their SNAP funds no longer cover certain items.\n\n\u201cOur associates are going to be the ones that are going to have to explain [to customers about the newly ineligible items], and they're also going to be the ones that are going to take the abuse from the customers who say, \u2018What do you mean I can't buy soft drinks? What do you mean I can't buy candy?\u2019\u201d Lackey said.\n\nEmployee training coupled with the cost of reprogramming the point-of-sale systems poses \u201ca tremendous cost to the retailers,\u201d Lackey said.\n\nBoxes of sugary cereal sit on shelves in a store in Miami, Fla., on April 16, 2025. Companies such as General Mills may lose sales as a result of SNAP cuts since many SNAP participants buy breakfast cereals. Joe Raedle via Getty Images\n\nCatering to SNAP consumers\n\nWith the flurry of changes, grocers still have opportunities to stand out to SNAP consumers and retain their spending, sources said.\n\nJohnson noted that NGA members love Double Up Food Bucks, which gives a dollar-for-dollar match for shoppers\u2019 SNAP spending on produce, finding that it helps with customer retention and provides shoppers the opportunity to expand their SNAP dollars. The Healthy Fluid Milk Incentives projects, which test initiatives that incentivize SNAP consumers to buy more milk, have also \u201cgrown quite a bit\u201d in recent years, and some NGA members are also participating in medically tailored produce prescriptions, Johnson added.\n\nThe cut to SNAP-Ed, which helped educate consumers about SNAP and how to make healthier food choices, poses an opportunity for retailers to fill that education gap, Ross said. Grocers can highlight full-calorie and reduced-calorie options and show consumers the health and budget advantages of at-home cooking, Ross suggested.\n\nGrocers can tell consumers that \u201cif you take the same meal from a Chipotle or from an Olive Garden, and you cook the same ingredients in your house, it's a third the price per serving and it's half the sodium and half the calories,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRoss said retailers should work with suppliers and brands to provide incremental promotions targeted at low-income consumers, which could help boost loyalty among those shoppers.\n\nSince the changes in SNAP participation eligibility will force some retired Americans back into the workforce in order to stay on the food assistance program, Ross suggested that grocers can advertise themselves as viable places for them to work.\n\n\u201cGrocery stores are a great place to employ retirees that want a part-time job. \u2026 That could be a real opportunity for us to bring a very stable and predictable and great customer service demographic back into retail that we lost during COVID,\u201d Ross said.\n\nIndependents, Ross suggested, can position hiring as \u201cLet's protect your SNAP benefits and we'll give you a 20-hour week job dealing with people having fun talking about food.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Grocers Brace for Major SNAP Cuts and State Restrictions**\n\n**Key details:** President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacting $186 billion in SNAP cuts over 10 years, primarily by altering eligibility requirements. Major changes include expanding work requirements to more age groups and limiting eligibility to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Concurrently, the USDA has granted waivers to six states, allowing them to restrict certain items like candy and soda from SNAP eligibility. States will also face increased financial responsibility for SNAP administration and benefits based on their \u201cerror rate\u201d starting in fiscal years 2027 and 2028.\n\n**Why it matters:** SNAP consumers are vital to grocers\u2019 bottom lines, typically having larger baskets and being \u201cvery loyal.\u201d The National Grocers Association (NGA) forecasts a 6.7% average sales hit for grocers over the next six months due to decreased SNAP participants, totaling $88 billion in cuts over 10 years. This challenges the current consensus that grocer revenue streams from loyal, high-spending SNAP customers are stable and predictable. Additionally, state waivers on eligible items pose significant administrative burdens and could shift consumer shopping across state lines, impacting sales beyond direct eligibility cuts.\n\n**The big picture:** Grocers are navigating a flurry of incoming SNAP changes from new federal legislation and state-level waivers. While the USDA had previously not approved state requests to restrict SNAP items, this year marks a change with six states receiving waivers. These developments come as retailers actively seek to retain and attract SNAP consumers. The SNAP program significantly impacts the economy, supporting approximately 388,000 jobs within the food industry and contributing billions in wages and taxes.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$186 billion:** Total SNAP cuts over 10 years from the new bill.\n*   **$88 billion:** NGA estimate of SNAP eligibility cuts over 10 years due to participant decrease.\n*   **6.7%:** NGA forecast for average sales hit to grocers over the next six months.\n*   **6 states:** Number of states granted waivers to restrict SNAP-eligible items.\n*   **12%:** Approximate percentage of U.S. grocery sales accounted for by SNAP.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Donald Trump:** Signed the bill causing significant SNAP cuts and eligibility changes.\n*   **Stephanie Johnson:** NGA VP providing analysis on SNAP cuts, forecasts, and grocer impacts.\n*   **John Ross:** IGA CEO commenting on eligibility, store failures, and grocer opportunities.\n*   **Albertsons:** Company whose President and CFO noted SNAP consumers' loyalty and larger spending.\n*   **Brooke Rollins:** U.S. Agriculture Secretary who signed SNAP food choice waivers for several states.\n*   **Cailey Locklair:** Maryland Retailers Alliance president discussing high error rates and community impact.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Grocers anticipate a decrease in SNAP sales over the next six months as states implement participant eligibility changes.\n*   Retailers in waiver states will observe if consumer shopping behavior shifts across state lines.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New SNAP changes threaten grocer sales and create significant operational burdens.",

        "summary_text": "Born during the Great Depression, when popcorn became America\u2019s favorite affordable treat, Wyandot Snacks started as a humble popcorn company in Marion, Ohio. Decades later, they were popping at full throttle, producing over 25% of the world\u2019s popcorn and even making Cracker Jack for Frito-Lay. Today, Wyandot continues that growth from a regional popcorn producer to a go-to co-manufacturer for some of the most recognized and fastest-growing snack brands in the U.S.\n\nThe business has always prided itself on its refusal to stay stagnant. Rather than sticking with the status quo, Wyandot has continually adapted, expanding its product offerings, shifting focus to meet evolving customer needs, and investing in new technologies to stay competitive in a fast-moving industry. Throughout their evolution as a business, they've chronicled their growth as a business at their local Wyandot Popcorn Museum, creating a visual representation of progress.\n\nAnd that momentum continues. To keep up with growing demand and maintain the pace it\u2019s sustained since 1936, Wyandot saw its next opportunity for optimization: automating its end-of-line production.\n\nAutomation Lets Wyandot Say \u201cYes\u201d to Customers More Often\n\nToday, Wyandot specializes in a wide range of extruded and baked snacks, from cereals and chips to popcorn. But producing such a diverse mix comes with operational challenges: frequent SKU changes, varying run sizes, and increasingly tight timelines from customers.\n\nThat pressure to produce became even more urgent with the recent addition of a major new customer, one that will require Wyandot to produce many millions of additional pounds of product. With labor gaps already straining production, Jaap Langenberg, CEO of Wyandot, found himself asking the essential question: How will we get all this product out the door on time with the labor we have?\n\nTo better serve high-volume customers who demand both precision and agility, Langenberg emphasized that automating manual palletizing was key to not only boosting productivity and closing labor gaps, but also taking care of the employees they have.\n\n\u201cThe snack industry is moving faster and becoming more specialized,\u201d Langenberg said. \u201cOur investment in automation is about meeting those demands without compromising the values this company has upheld for nearly 90 years: quality, safety, community, and employee wellbeing.\u201d\n\nTaking the Strain Off Production Line Employees\n\nManual palletizing is one of the most physically demanding jobs on the production line, often resulting in injuries from repetitive bending, lifting, and twisting. That was a major factor in Wyandot\u2019s decision to invest in automated palletizing, freeing employees from highly strenuous tasks and transitioning them into more value-added roles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not automating to eliminate workers,\u201d said Lori Roberts, Senior Executive Project Manager at Wyandot. \u201cThe goal is to take away the most physically demanding tasks so our team can focus on higher-level work that requires judgment, creativity, and oversight.\u201d\n\nThose employees previously assigned to manual packing and lifting roles will instead be trained to operate and maintain the new systems. Wyandot is also launching an automation certification program that provides hands-on training and creates a path for workers to grow into supervisory or technical roles.\n\nEmployees are excited. \u201cPeople want to feel like they\u2019re growing,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAutomation is giving them new pathways to do that within our company.\u201d\n\nWhen Automation Doesn\u2019t Go as Planned: Why Wyandot Chose a Full Service Model\n\nAutomated palletizing isn\u2019t Wyandot\u2019s first foray into automation. About five years ago, the company invested in case packers to begin the transition. That project helped the team get comfortable with automation, understand its impact on their lines, and better manage growing productivity demands. Most importantly, it helped clarify what they truly needed from automation: flexibility to support a growing customer base.\n\nThat meant finding the right partner, and they did so with Formic\u2019s Full Service Automation model. Rather than purchasing the equipment outright, Formic\u2019s model allows Wyandot to implement systems quickly without any upfront capital investment, while providing ongoing technical and maintenance support. Additionally, as business needs naturally change and grow like they have for the past 90 years at Wyandot, Formic swaps equipment and manages redeployment.\n\n\u201cHaving a partner like Formic that handles installation, maintenance, and equipment swapping allows us to stay focused on what we do best: Making great snacks,\u201d Langenberg said. \u201cIt also reduces the risk and guesswork that can come with large-scale automation projects.\u201d\n\nThe data collected from these automated systems is also laying the groundwork for smarter, more sustainable operations. With real-time visibility into energy usage, production bottlenecks, and scheduling efficiency, Wyandot is better positioned to meet rising customer expectations around transparency and carbon footprint, while optimizing long-term planning across the supply chain.\n\nFor a mid-sized manufacturer like Wyandot, where every investment must balance flexibility and scale, Full Service Automation has proven to be the right fit.\n\nLooking Ahead: Wyandot Isn\u2019t Done Innovating\n\nWyandot is already looking ahead, with plans to deploy new automated case packers in the future. The company\u2019s leadership believes that the work being done today is laying the foundation for decades of future growth.\n\n\u201cAutomation is not about replacing our legacy,\u201d Langenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building on it. We\u2019re taking everything that made Wyandot great, our people, our culture, our commitment to quality, and giving it the tools to thrive in a new era.\u201d\n\nAs Wyandot steps into its next chapter, one thing is clear: automation is helping a factory floor in Marion keep up with its ever-evolving production.\n\nBuild on your legacy just like Wyandot. Discover how Formic\u2019s Full Service Automation can help your team grow, your operation scale, and your customers stay happy here.",

To bring the family of brands closer together, Kroger in 2021 unveiled an enterprise logo, the citrus-inspired \u201cFresh Cart,\u201d that spans its brands.\n\nVisuals are only one part of Kroger\u2019s brand experience, especially in a grocery category where touch, taste and smell are equally potent. And earlier this year, the company added the fifth sense to its toolbox with a new sonic ecosystem that is now part of its external and internal brand experience.\n\n\u201cWe wanted [the sonic logo] to be more than just an advertising jingle \u2014 that was never the spirit. We wanted for it to act as a cue to the customer experience. We always intended from the beginning that we were going to use this in many different ways, beyond just traditional paid advertising,\u201d said Tom Duncan, the vice president and head of marketing at Kroger.\n\nKroger\u2019s sonic logo, a sunny, jazz-inspired melody, was designed to be emotionally warm while also distinctive and flexible, Duncan explained. As the Fresh Cart appears in paid advertising, owned channels and retail touchpoints, Kroger\u2019s new sonic identity will be deployed across multichannel advertising, retail environments, hold music, events and internal communications.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of research and science that shows that the more senses that you can engage, the better recall, attribution and emotional impact that you have in your experiences, both advertising and otherwise,\u201d the executive said.\n\nMaking the brand\n\nThe company responsible for taking that research and science and turning it into a sonic ecosystem for Kroger was Made Music Studio, a company founded in 1995. Despite all those years in the space, Made Music executives are still surprised when marketers don\u2019t understand the nuance of sonic branding.\n\n\u201cIt's surprising to some folks, that it's not just those little mnemonics that you hear at the end of a commercial or a jingle \u2014 it's actually a sonic system that we craft very strategically,\u201d said John Taite, executive vice president of global brand partnerships and development at Made Music. \u201cIt really has to make people feel a particular thing about a brand, product or experience.\u201d\n\nWhen crafting a sonic ecosystem, Made Music staff attempt to be \u201cmusical detectives\u201d or \u201cmusical method actors,\u201d considering what the brand means to consumers, its impact on culture, and how sound complements its visual branding. The studio keyed in on the idea of a brand with one foot in the past but one foot in the future that leans on history but has a modern place in consumers\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe instant feeling that you get [from the sonic logo] is something that's fresh, friendly, relatable. There's an inherent playfulness in it. It's very upbeat, it's got modern instrumentation in it. There's a hint of history with a little bit of jazz,\u201d Taite explained, noting that the riff also includes a musical blue note in a nod to Kroger\u2019s iconic brand color.\n\n\u201cWe try to get a sense of the brand essence, what it means to them. What is that brand truth, that unique feeling that sets it apart in their minds and in the minds of consumers? We're always trying to get to that point where we're uncovering the inevitable sound of a brand \u2014 a sound that just really couldn't sound like anybody else,\u201d Taite added.\n\nLike everything else developed and deployed by marketers, sonic branding must help a brand reach its goals and KPIs. Made Music worked with researchers at Sentient Decision Science and discovered that Kroger\u2019s sonic identity tested as one of the best the studio has ever tested with the firm. That finding gives Kroger and Made Music confidence as the sonic identity is rolled out in advertising and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe more you hear it, the more you'll love it, the more it will feel like it's always been in the market,\u201d Taite said. \u201cEvery piece of sound that somebody interacts with leaves an impression, whether it's intentional or not. Modern brands need to be prepared to meet those hard-to-reach audiences, certainly Gen Z customers, when they're consuming content.\u201d",

The test store includes a new layout, signage, storytelling and merchandising, and a new fresh category ordering and forecasting tool, Potter said. The discounter is also introducing tools and training focused on fresh meat and produce after seeing improved sales at the Oakland pilot linked to product freshness for both categories, Potter said.\n\nAs the discounter continues its goal to attract and retain top talent, Potter noted that the company recently hired Matt Delly as its chief merchandising officer. Delly previously was a consultant for Chedraui USA and chief merchandising officer at 99 Cents Only Stores, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nGrocery Outlet said it substantially completed its restructuring plan in Q2. That plan, which the discounter unveiled alongside its Q4 results, included terminating certain unopened store leases, discontinuing store development plans, canceling some capital-intensive warehouse projects and reducing headcount.\n\nThe restructuring, which aims to improve the discounter\u2019s long-term profitability, cash flow generation and optimize the footprint of new store growth, cost roughly $63 million.\n\nGrocery Outlet recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of achieving over $1 billion in net sales. The discounter attributed the net sales growth to new store sales, the increase in comp-store sales and the Easter holiday happening later this year compared to last year. Comp-store sales grew mainly due to an increase in transactions, which offset a slight dip in the average transaction size. This quarter marked the first time Grocery Outlet factored stores from the acquisition of United Grocery Outlet last year into its comp-store sales.\n\nDuring Q2, Grocery Outlet opened 11 stores and closed two, ending the quarter with 552 stores across 16 states. Potter said on the earnings call that Grocery Outlet is on track to hit its goal of opening at least 33 stores this year.\n\nSince 2018, Grocery Outlet has nearly halved its debt, according to a presentation. Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA has grown from $143.4 million in 2018 to $249.1 million. Grocery Outlet shared that its net leverage \u2014 a metric of a company\u2019s financial risk \u2014 has significantly improved.\n\nGrocery Outlet reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which forecasts the company will achieve between $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion in net sales and see a comp-store sales increase between 1% to 2%.",

The Department of Health and Human Services said the waivers aim to end the \"subsidization of popular types of junk food.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSNAP consumers make up nearly a quarter of spending in the packaged foods industry, according to Numerator, and new restrictions stand to further limit sales at a time when consumption is already slowing.\n\nRestrictions on benefits also vary by state, adding to the confusion for the food industry. Some states are only banning sodas, while others are targeting energy drinks and candy. Florida is so far the only state to restrict SNAP purchases of prepared desserts.\n\nAdding to the complications, state bans also have different definitions for what's considered candy or sugary drinks.\n\nIndiana and Nebraska, for example, are both banning soft drink purchases but have different definitions of the beverage. Indiana says soft drinks encompass all nonalcoholic beverages with natural or artificial sweeteners, while Nebraska defines them as carbonated nonalcoholic beverages containing water, a sweetening agent, flavoring and carbon dioxide gas.\n\nOther states have even more complexity. Iowa, which has one of the most restrictive SNAP rules, is banning sugar-sweetened beverages that contain less than 50% juice, including sodas, energy drinks and flavored waters. The state is also restricting drink concentrates and powdered mix-ins.\n\nIowa is also taking an expansive definition of candy, banning traditional gum and candies in addition to fruit leather, ready-to-eat caramel corn and granola bars unless they contain flour. Trail mix, or other snacks where fruits and nuts are combined with sugar or chocolate, is also banned.\n\nAs some states provide detailed definitions, others remain vague. Arkansas is banning soda and \"unhealthy drinks,\" without providing a description of what the latter entails.\n\nMore states have moved toward restricting SNAP purchases as part of a push from HHS Secretary Robert F.

More money was spent on soft drinks than any other item across all households, though SNAP users spent somewhat more.\n\nWhile SNAP participants are more likely to have higher rates of obesity, recent research from the National Institutes of Health suggests other factors like poor mental health may be driving unhealthy eating patterns.\n\nThe food industry has long fought efforts to restrict SNAP purchases, arguing that the program addresses hunger and obesity by increasing access to retailers with healthier foods.\n\n\"At a time when many Americans need the temporary assistance available through SNAP, it is more important than ever that policies promote benefit adequacy and access, not introduce unwise complexity or stigma,\" a coalition of industry groups, which includes FMI \u2013 The Food Industry Association, previously wrote to the White House.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJuly was a busy month for executive changeover with Ahold Delhaize and Aldi US welcoming executives to their C-Suites.\n\nThe month also saw top-level executive departures at United Natural Foods, Inc., Instacart and Heritage Grocers.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of top-level executive shifts that unfolded in July.\n\nAlbertsons names new retail media head\n\nBrian Monahan Courtesy of Albertsons Companies\n\nThe grocer appointed Brian Monahan as head of Albertsons Media Collective, succeeding Kristi Argyilan, who left in December. Monahan joined Albertsons from global marketing and communications company Dentsu. Monahan\u2019s appointment is part of Albertsons\u2019 plans to advance its \u201cCustomers for Life\u201d strategy, which emphasizes deeper relationships with consumers no matter where they shop, and accelerate the growth of its retail media arm.\n\nTop retail executive exits UNFI\n\nUNFI parted ways with Andre Persaud, who served as president and CEO of the company\u2019s retail division.\n\nUNFI did not provide details about the departure of Persaud, who joined in November 2023, saying only that he left in connection with the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued work to accelerate its retail business strategy\u201d and that he is entitled to severance benefits. Persaud\u2019s exit comes as UNFI\u2019s retail division struggled to achieve quarterly sales growth.\n\nWalmart taps Instacart executive for leading AI role\n\nWalmart tapped Daniel Danker from Instacart to be the retailer\u2019s executive vice president of AI acceleration, product and design. Danker, who most recently served as chief product officer at Instacart, will \u201caccelerate [Walmart\u2019s] AI transformation and lead all product management and design across the enterprise,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon shared on LinkedIn.\n\nDanker spent just over four years at Instacart, during which the company launched a bevy of consumer experience innovations. Danker\u2019s exit marks the latest C-suite change for the grocery technology company this year, including promoting Chris Rogers to CEO and appointing Lisa Blackwood-Kapral as its chief accounting officer and principal accounting officer.\n\nAldi US unveils new COO\n\nAtty McGrath Retrieved from PR Newswire\n\nWith Atty McGrath set to become CEO of Aldi US, the discount grocer announced longtime executive Karla Waddleton will replace McGrath as chief operating officer. Waddleton said on LinkedIn that she started with Aldi more than 20 years ago as a district manager in St. Louis. She rose through the ranks, becoming director of real estate and development in 2006, director of store operations in 2012 and vice president in 2014, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nWith McGrath\u2019s and Waddleton\u2019s appointments, Aldi\u2019s leadership team in the U.S. will have company veterans who have each been with the discount grocer for over two decades.\n\nAhold Delhaize names new CTO\n\nAhold Delhaize said it appointed Jan Brecht as CTO, replacing Ben Wishart. Brecht, who will also become a member of the company\u2019s executive committee, will join Sept. 26 and lead the company\u2019s technology function, overseeing enterprise tech strategy, digital innovation and cybersecurity.\n\nBrecht brings extensive experience from several industries, including serving as chief digital information officer at Nissan, CIO of Mercedes-Benz and as CIO and head of global supply chain at Adidas.\n\nHeritage Grocers\u2019 CEO departs\n\nThe grocery company, which oversees several Hispanic chains, is looking for a new leader now that Suzy Monford has stepped down as board chair and CEO to \u201cpursue other opportunities.\u201d\n\nSuzy Monford Courtesy of Heritage Grocer\n\nDuring Monford\u2019s roughly nine months at the helm, Heritage made numerous executive appointments, including naming a new CFO, and strategic adjustments to help the company grow and evolve.\n\nHeritage named David Hirz, who most recently served as president and CEO of Smart & Final, as chair of the company board. The company also created an Office of the CEO, made up of senior leaders, to guide the company as it searches for a replacement.\n\nAssociated Grocers of New England names a new COO\n\nRuss Greenlaw shared on LinkedIn that he started as COO at the New England retailers\u2019 cooperative, which serves independent grocery stores and convenience stores.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Grocery Sector Sees Significant C-Suite Shake-Ups in July\n\n**Key details:** July saw multiple C-suite changes across the grocery sector. Albertsons named Brian Monahan to lead its media arm, while Walmart hired Instacart's Daniel Danker for a key AI role. UNFI's retail division president, Andre Persaud, departed amidst sales struggles, and Heritage Grocers' CEO Suzy Monford also stepped down. Aldi US promoted Karla Waddleton to COO, and Ahold Delhaize appointed Jan Brecht as CTO.\n\n**Why it matters:** These executive shifts signal strategic priorities and potential challenges for key industry players. UNFI's retail division struggled with sales growth, leading to a top executive departure, which could challenge a view of consistent performance. Walmart's significant hire for AI acceleration underscores a rapid push into advanced technology, potentially shifting competitive landscapes. Instacart's multiple C-suite changes, including a key departure, might raise questions about leadership stability. The short tenure and departure of Heritage Grocers' CEO also suggest ongoing strategic evolution for the company.\n\n**The big picture:** July was a busy month for executive changes, seeing both new appointments and significant departures across the grocery and retail technology sectors. These shifts reflect ongoing strategic initiatives, such as Albertsons' focus on deepening consumer relationships and Walmart's push for AI transformation. Some changes, like at UNFI, occurred amidst sales struggles in specific divisions.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn late 2021, word got out that Midwest supermarket and convenience store operator Hy-Vee planned to enter Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee. At the time, former CEO Randy Edeker said the company knew \u201cit had so much to offer consumers across the U.S.\u201d that it felt confident in making a major expansion into new territory.\n\nThe expansion plan was a significant step for Hy-Vee, which operates about 240 supermarkets and nearly 200 c-stores. Not only would it grow its footprint from eight to 12 states and look to cement itself as a legitimate threat in the competitive Southeast market, but it would be doing so organically by constructing upwards of 20 grocery stores as well as numerous adjacent convenience stores, liquor stores and fuel stations.\n\nThe initial plan was to have 21 locations operating in the new markets by this year, according to a report from the Des Moines Register, citing a leaked internal video presentation by Edeker. Hy-Vee went on to make a series of announcements touting plans to open stores in places like Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Fishers, Indiana. But nearly four years later, not only have none of these stores opened, but ones that were expected to be built haven't even started construction, according to public records and recent interviews with officials across these states.\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t been entirely quiet on the expansion front. Last year, it entered Indiana with the purchase of 22 Strack & Van Til supermarkets, which will retain their brand name and operate as a Hy-Vee subsidiary.\n\nWhere Hy-Vee planned to expand The Midwestern grocer's branded store footprint and states it planned to open new stores.\n\nYet the scope of its four-state expansion plan is still unclear. When asked to comment on these plans in early August, Hy-Vee Senior Vice President of Communications Tina Potthoff said that Hy-Vee\u2019s primary focus at the moment is expanding in Indiana. She added that Hy-Vee still owns property in Kentucky and Tennessee but did not disclose the locations or construction timelines.\n\nIn a February 2024 interview with trade publication Progressive Grocer, Hy-Vee CEO Jeremy Gosch said that inflation and high construction and inventory costs had bogged down the company\u2019s Southeast expansion plans. Officials in several cities slated for expansion said it\u2019s been years since Hy-Vee provided updates \u2014 yet none of them said the retailer has told them the project is canceled.\n\nHere\u2019s where things stand with Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion plans.\n\nFew project records and updates\n\nTennessee was expected to see the largest influx of Hy-Vee stores in this expansion, according to the Des Moines Register\u2019s 2021 account and local news reports, including two grocery stores and a distribution center in Nashville, plus several other locations across cities like Knoxville, Memphis, Murfreesboro and Spring Hill.\n\nBut while Hy-Vee confirmed it still owns property in Tennessee, it\u2019s unclear where these sites are located and what their status is.\n\nPublic records searches with Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, for example, were unable to locate updates on where Hy-Vee\u2019s plans stand, while officials with Knox County, where Knoxville is located, said in a phone call that they were unable to locate records for a planned Hy-Vee store in the county.\n\nAccording to local news reports, a Hy-Vee location in Bartlett, a suburb of Memphis, was expected to open on the corner of New Brunswick Road and Old Brunswick Road. However, last month officials in Bartlett told the Des Moines Register that the plans for a Hy-Vee store in the area had been dropped.\n\nA Hy-Vee grocery store in Grimes, Iowa, includes a large selection of fresh products, general merchandise and foodservice stations. Jeff Wells/Grocery Dive\n\nMurfreesboro and Spring Hill\u2019s records show some movement on store development, but updates fizzle out between 2022 and 2023.\n\nTwo Hy-Vee stores are slated for Murfreesboro, on Memorial Boulevard and Haynes Drive, and another off New Salem Highway near Barfield Road on the city\u2019s Southwest side, according to minutes from the Murfreesboro Planning Commission from March 2023. The commission\u2019s minutes disclosed that the Memorial Boulevard Hy-Vee site includes a 153,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center as well as a more than 10,000-square-foot liquor store. Meanwhile, the planned New Salem Highway Hy-Vee site includes a 116,000-square-foot grocery store and a 6,000-square-foot convenience store with a fueling station.\n\nBrad Barbee, Murfreesboro\u2019s principal planner, said in July the city approved the Memorial Drive project back in March 2023, but that he hasn\u2019t heard from the company in \u201csome time.\u201d Hy-Vee has until March 2026 to resume the project before the site plans expire.\n\nDespite the lack of recent communication, Barbee said he has \u201cno reason to believe [the project] isn\u2019t moving forward.\u201d\n\nSpring Hill\u2019s planned Hy-Vee storefront, meanwhile, is zoned for just over 16 acres on the Southeast corner of Buckner Lane and Buckner Road, according to city public records. In April 2022, Hy-Vee requested a \u201cconcept plan review\u201d for a grocery store and gas station. The next and last available public record, dated July 2022, is a resolution regarding the installation of water and sewer lines at the site.\n\nConstruction headaches\n\nBefore its acquisition of Strack & Van Til, Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion into Indiana was initially set to include two stores in the north Indianapolis suburbs of Zionsville and Fishers. Despite Hy-Vee\u2019s spokesperson emphasizing that the company is momentarily focused on growing in the Hoosier State, it hasn\u2019t started building either site due to construction delays, according to officials from both cities.\n\nBoth sites are supposed to share a distribution center, which also hasn\u2019t begun construction, Zionsville Mayor John Stehr said in an interview.\n\nHy-Vee\u2019s Fast & Fresh convenience store brand was also featured in its expansion plans. Jeff Wells/Grocery Dive\n\nIn a statement, Ross Hilleary, director of planning and zoning with the city of Fishers, said Hy-Vee delayed its local store due to \u201cimpending road improvements.\u201d When asked to elaborate, Hatem Mekky, Fishers\u2019 director of engineering, said the city is working on two roundabout projects \u2014 one at the intersection where Hy-Vee is expecting to build and another about two blocks away \u2014 that are slated for construction next year.\n\nHy-Vee told Stehr earlier this spring that the company is \u201cwaiting for the construction cost to come in line with their goals\u201d before they begin building Zionsville\u2019s first store, Stehr said.\n\nStehr added that he keeps in touch with Hy-Vee\u2019s team \u201cevery couple of months,\u201d and that despite the delay, he has no reason to believe they\u2019re backing out of the project or putting the property up for sale.\n\nDuring their last interaction this year, Stehr said he and Hy-Vee\u2019s team discussed the grocer\u2019s 2024 acquisition of Strack & Van Til in Northwest Indiana, which signaled that the company was active in its expansion plans.\n\nPlans on hold \u2014 or potentially never started\n\nHy-Vee\u2019s plans for Kentucky so far include just one store in Louisville. Last October, Potthoff told Louisville Business First that the grocer hadn\u2019t set a date to break ground but still planned to build the 150,000-square-foot store.\n\nIt turns out these plans were put on hold three years ago when all parking lot, grading and foundation permits for the site were withdrawn, according to records with the city of Louisville. Although Hy-Vee said it still owns the location today, the permits were axed in an April 2022 email exchange between Erin Hiscox, a project engineer with Hy-Vee, and Janice Johnston, a building inspector with the city, according to records viewed by a C-Store Dive reporter.\n\nA spokesperson from the city confirmed in July that no progress has been made on the site since this email exchange. The spokesperson said they weren\u2019t sure why Hy-Vee withdrew these permits, but said that \u201cit might have been a case where they didn\u2019t have the applicable planning applications approved yet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson from the Jefferson County Property Valuation Administrator said in a statement that they have no information to share on the site\u2019s delay.\n\n\"They say they\u2019re still coming, but their actions might indicate otherwise, and they\u2019re not really making any meaningful movement toward coming here.\" John Stehr Mayor of Zionsville, Indiana\n\nSimilarly, Hy-Vee\u2019s first Alabama store hasn\u2019t made any progress. The site was originally planned to open in Huntsville in 2023, the Des Moines Register reported in 2021, but the city appears to be unaware of the grocery chain\u2019s entrance plans.\n\n\u201cAfter consulting with our Inspections department, it appears that no plans were ever submitted and no permits were ever issued for a Hy-Vee grocery store for the City of Huntsville,\u201d the city said in response to a request for public records.\n\nWhile Potthoff confirmed Hy-Vee still has a stake in Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky, she did not give any update on whether the grocer owns property in Alabama or if it still plans to enter the state.\n\nAs Hy-Vee\u2019s expansion plans have stalled, other regional grocers and c-store chains have moved into the same states it\u2019s targeting, making any eventual move all the more challenging. Publix now operates several grocery stores in Kentucky, while Wawa and QuikTrip recently opened their first stores in Indiana. Wawa also recently opened its first store in Kentucky in late July.\n\nHy-Vee is also contending with rapidly evolving low-price retailers like Walmart, Aldi and Dollar General that operate stores in many of the same Midwest markets. Research shows that these discount retailers are putting increasing pressure on traditional grocers as consumer price sensitivity has risen.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not Hy-Vee will ever carry out its original plan, or amend it in some way, but plenty of questions linger.\n\nIn Indiana, where Hy-Vee says it\u2019s most squarely focused, Mayor Stehr admitted that he has no idea when the Zionsville store might be built, as the company hasn\u2019t updated him on any of these plans. Stehr added that he doesn\u2019t expect this store to open in 2025.\n\n\u201cI do not have 100% confidence that they\u2019re going to come here,\u201d he said. \u201cI only know what they\u2019re telling me\u2026 they say they\u2019re still coming, but their actions might indicate otherwise, and they\u2019re not really making any meaningful movement toward coming here.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled street names in Spring Hill, Tennessee. A Hy-Vee store was zoned for the intersection of Buckner Lane and Buckner Road, according to public records.",

UNFI and Key Food also recently decided to end a multi-year contract that UNFI had expected to bring in $1 billion in annual sales during the 10-year duration of the deal, which they signed in 2021.\n\nSales for UNFI\u2019s retail group, which includes its two banners, increased by less than 1% year over year during the company\u2019s third quarter. With the exception of that quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024, the company\u2019s retail division recorded negative sales growth each quarter during Persaud\u2019s tenure.\n\nBest will report to Douglas and serve on UNFI\u2019s senior leadership team. UNFI did not provide details about why Persaud left, only saying that his departure is connected to the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued work to accelerate its retail business strategy\u201d and that he is entitled to severance benefits.\n\nMeanwhile, Best\u2019s departure marks the latest executive change at Coborn\u2019s.

He will be responsible for accelerating the company\u2019s retail business growth strategy and overseeing its Cub Foods and Shoppers Food Warehouse banners. Best replaces Andre Persaud, who departed on July 25 after less than two years in the role.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis executive change comes as UNFI seeks to rightsize its retail division and recover from significant financial setbacks.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJoel Rampoldt heads the U.S. division of one of the world\u2019s largest grocery chains, but on a recent visit to one of Lidl\u2019s more than 185 stateside stores, he was intensely focused on the order of the ingredients in a jar of private label hazelnut spread.\n\nRampoldt, CEO of Lidl US, was particularly pleased that the product had a greater percentage of hazelnuts than Nutella, a name brand counterpart on display close to it. He pointed out that Lidl's alternative was also less expensive.\n\n\u201cHazelnuts are the second ingredient [in Lidl\u2019s version of the spread], so it\u2019s a higher proportion,\u201d Rampoldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small thing. But it\u2019s just one very small proof point on just how good that product is.\u201d\n\nSpecifics about the composition of individual products on Lidl\u2019s shelves are the kinds of intricate details that excite Rampoldt as he strives to ramp up Lidl\u2019s presence on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, where the German retailer opened its first stores less than a decade ago and is still trying to build name recognition. Rampoldt\u2019s goal is to demonstrate to shoppers that Lidl can be their primary supermarket even though the chain deliberately has a more limited assortment than other grocers.\n\nJoel Rampoldt Sam Silverstein/Grocery Dive\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t offer the best price and the best quality on every single item you can stock. So we\u2019re very selective,\u201d said Rampoldt. \u201cThe idea is that with the [limited] number of products we have in our stores, you should be able to meet every need that you have as a shopper.\u201d\n\nA former management consultant who took over the top job at the discount food retailer in 2023, Rampoldt makes a point of spending one day most months working in a Lidl store through a company program that allows corporate workers to perform store-level duties.\n\n\u201cI usually just show up and ask the store manager, \u2018Where do you want me today?\u2019\u201d he said, noting that he especially enjoys helping to make the freshly baked goods \u2014 including the signature 49-cent croissants -\u2013 that Lidl prepares in its stores first thing in the morning.\n\nRampoldt spoke with Grocery Dive about his attraction to the grocery industry \u2014 and particularly his love for food \u2014 as he led a tour of Lidl\u2019s location in Chantilly, Virginia, in July.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity\n\nGROCERY DIVE: It\u2019s obvious that you have a love of food \u2014 that for you, this is not just a business where you have to watch the numbers. You seem to really want people to really enjoy shopping for groceries.\n\nJOEL RAMPOLDT: That\u2019s right \u2014 especially in fresh. It\u2019s not as easy to be excited about a can of beans, but we have to have cans of beans. But fresh is where our customers first see us when they walk in the door. Fresh is the center of the plate for meals, fresh protein especially. So this is something that, overall, I\u2019m very excited about.\n\nHow does your passion for knowing specific details about items Lidl sells reflect how other people at the company think?\n\nWe have to be so careful about which items we carry, because we can\u2019t carry everything, [so] we really like having people who go deep. What is the best possible way to make this? Who\u2019s the best supplier? What\u2019s the most efficient way to ship it? And you can go deep when you don\u2019t have 30,000 items. You can know each one really, really well.\n\nLidl stores carry products that you might expect to find at a specialty grocery store, like ham from Spain and Irish butter. Are you intentionally trying to differentiate your stores from other grocers\u2019 locations by bringing the feel of a specialty retailer to your locations to some extent?\n\nThat is exactly what we\u2019re shooting for. Now, there are things that we will never do. We\u2019re never going to have service counters. We\u2019re not going to have rotisserie chicken [because that would be] inconsistent with our cost structure and our cost promise, our price promise. But you\u2019re exactly right. If we can have aspects of a specialty food store, then why wouldn\u2019t we do this?\n\nIn the U.S., Lidl offers a selection of strategically placed name brand products alongside its private label products. Sam Silverstein/Grocery Dive\n\nWhat are your thoughts about how Lidl\u2019s practice of putting goods on shelves in the boxes they\u2019re shipped in affects how they look to shoppers?\n\nSome retailers will always hand-stack. They want the presentation to be beautiful and perfect. I don\u2019t want it to be beautiful and perfect. I want it to be in stock, easy to shop and the best price.\n\nLidl found a way to make a fresh bakery work within the company\u2019s model. Have you given any thought to ever introducing, say, a deli counter that also reflects Lidl\u2019s focus on efficiency?\n\nMy view is that\u2019s a bridge too far. Maybe some day we\u2019ll get around to trying that, but right now the quality that we can offer in our fresh meat case is more than good enough. The math doesn\u2019t work the way it does in bakery.\n\nWhile Lidl US doesn\u2019t offer full-service meat or deli departments, it has figured out how to bring fresh-baked goods to its stores. Sam Silverstein/Grocery Dive\n\nHow did your background as a management consultant affect your decision to join Lidl?\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of grocery companies from the inside and lots of different formats, and I\u2019ve always been very passionate about the discounter business model.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with discounters in Europe and here in the U.S. And this model of keeping it simple, having a carefully curated number of SKUs, having stores that are smaller and easier to get into and out of, leading on price, works. I know it works. And so I thought it was a great opportunity for me to help Lidl make it work here in the U.S., just like we do everywhere else.\n\nPeople often think of Lidl in the same vein as Aldi, since you\u2019re both discounters and based in Germany. What are your thoughts about that?\n\nThere are superficial similarities, and there are some non-superficial similarities, between Aldi and Lidl \u2014 but there are also some very big differences. We know from our customer research, there are some customers who shop with both of us, but there are an awful lot of customers who really just choose one or the other and are loyal to them. So they do their thing, and I wish them luck at that. And we do what we think is right for us.",

Kennedy Jr. falsely claimed, against the evidence of many clinical trials, that mRNA vaccines \u201cfail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\u201d\n\nInstead, Kennedy said in the statement, HHS will shift funding toward what he described as \u201csafer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\u201d\n\nHundreds of millions of people received mRNA vaccines developed for COVID by Moderna as well as partners Pfizer and BioNTech. Testing in large clinical trials found them highly protective against the most serious outcomes of the disease and broadly safe. Additional research found an association with myocarditis in young men, but the relative risk is small and inflammation can also be caused by COVID.\n\nTheir development in record time was the product of close collaboration between the U.S. government and drugmakers during the Trump administration\u2019s first term. Unlike older vaccine technologies, mRNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and modified to better match circulating viruses, making it a vital pandemic response tool.\n\n\u201cBARDA invested in mRNA technology precisely because it could deliver safe, scalable vaccines in record time, a capability proven during COVID. By dismantling that platform, we\u2019re crippling our front-line defense, just ahead of unknown biological threats,\u201d Rick Bright, the director of BARDA during the first Trump administration, wrote in a post on X.\n\nPaul Offit, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that mRNA technology could help scientists respond more quickly in the event of another pandemic than older methods like whole-killed virus vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt's a giant step backward for science,\u201d Offit added in an interview. \u201cThe research and development that was being done by BARDA was getting us ready for the future and this makes our future less bright.\u201d\n\nKennedy, a vaccine skeptic who for years criticized mRNA technology, has taken steps since becoming HHS secretary that experts fear weaken the country\u2019s public health. He fired a vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and replaced its members with hand-picked successors who share many of his views. He changed CDC recommendations for COVID vaccines in pregnant women and children, while the Food and Drug Administration, which he oversees, has set strict approval standards for the shots.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses,\u201d Kennedy said in a video on the social media site X.\n\nHHS said that, outside of vaccine development, other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by the announcement.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nShakespeare famously wrote in The Tempest, \u201cWhat\u2019s past is prologue,\u201d to express how events of the past set the stage for developments in the present.\n\nThat sentiment was clear for health insurers in the second quarter, in which companies that slashed Medicare benefits and cut loose unprofitable members last year enjoyed apparent immunity from the tidal wave of medical costs burying their peers.\n\nHumana and CVS were the only insurers to raise their annual profit expectations following the second quarter, bucking a broader downturn. Four other major payers \u2014 UnitedHealth, Elevance, Centene and Molina \u2014 either lowered their profit expectations or established new floors well below previous targets.\n\n(The other major publicly traded insurer, Cigna, reaffirmed its previous outlook. Cigna does not participate in MA.)\n\nThe state of play is a sharp about-face from 2024. Last year, Humana and CVS were hit hardest by utilization and regulatory changes in the privatized Medicare program as Biden administration policies that shrunk reimbursement coincided with increasing medical spending. Their insurance profits plummeted as a result.\n\nBoth insurers retrenched with the hope of improving margins in 2025, slimming their plans and waving goodbye to counties where they couldn\u2019t turn a profit.\n\nThat strategy is bearing fruit, CVS and Humana executives told investors in second-quarter calls.\n\nMoves that Aetna made last year to rationalize its products and geographies have resulted in an \u201coptimal\u201d Medicare membership mix, Steve Nelson, the president of Aetna, said during CVS\u2019 call with analysts in late July.\n\n\u201cAll respect to the environment that we\u2019re in \u2014 very, very encouraged how the quarter is playing out,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nHumana\u2019s MA membership has dropped by more than 400,000 people since the end of 2024, while CVS\u2019 has fallen by more than 200,000 people.\n\nIn comparison, other insurers like UnitedHealth expanded their MA membership for 2025, likely capturing some of the high-cost members that Humana and CVS offloaded, according to analysts.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s insurance division UnitedHealthcare added more than 500,000 MA members in the first half of 2025 \u2014 the largest enrollment growth among leading MA organizations. That\u2019s placed the payer in a tough situation: saddled with more membership at a time of higher costs.\n\nUnitedHealthcare executives said they significantly underestimated accelerating medical trend when they priced their plans for this year, especially in MA.\n\nMedicare is the biggest single driver of lower earnings expectations for 2025, according to Tim Noel, the head of UnitedHealthcare. \u201cIn short, most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more,\u201d Noel said on UnitedHealth\u2019s late July call with investors.\n\nMolina also reported medical costs as a percentage of premiums \u2014 a metric called the medical loss ratio, or MLR, closely watched by investors \u2014 came in higher than the company had expected in MA.\n\nIn comparison, executives for Humana and CVS said their plans were well-equipped to cover elevated medical utilization. Humana said its business reduction was to thank.\n\n\u201cWe were the only plans to reduce benefits in any way in [2024] and we reduced more benefits more significantly than just about any of our competitors in [2025],\u201d said George Renaudin, the president of Humana\u2019s insurance segment, during the late July call.\n\nGiven the reductions, \u201cwe have a significant gap to peers\u2019 benefit value while some peers held their benefits stable or even invested more in their benefits,\u201d he added.\n\nMedical costs as a percentage of premiums grew the least for Humana and CVS Health insurers\u2019 second quarter medical loss ratios, 2024 versus 2025\n\nPayers that didn\u2019t adequately forecast costs said that they plan to scale back benefits and exit additional markets in 2026 in a bid to recover earnings and get back on Wall Street\u2019s good side.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, which is the largest MA insurer in the U.S., outlined a particularly aggressive strategy. The payer intends to exit plans that currently serve more than 600,000 members, executives said.\n\nUnitedHealthcare will also raise premiums and cut benefits to \u201cintensely focus\u201d on recovering profits, Noel said during the investor call.\n\nAs insurers continue to sacrifice growth for profitability, seniors may find themselves with fewer plan options next year. Those remaining may be less generous \u2014 especially in the vaunted supplemental benefits like dental coverage or debit cards unique to MA \u2014 and include higher premiums or cost sharing.\n\nStill, even with the cuts for 2025, there was still a panoply of plans available for most seniors this year, suggesting that smaller insurers could step into gaps left by the departure of their larger peers. Nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries lived in a county with more than 50 MA plan options for 2025, according to the health policy think tank KFF.\n\nMedicaid and the ACA\n\nInsurers are also battening down the hatches in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, two areas additionally slammed by rising costs.\n\nIn the second quarter, Medicaid spending rose sharply, particularly in behavioral healthcare and high-cost medications, while states\u2019 payment rates weren\u2019t high enough to compensate. As for ACA plans, a market-wide increase in members\u2019 health needs drove higher-than-expected spend, executives for multiple insurers said.\n\nInsurers brought in less profit or even lost money from offering insurance in the second quarter \u2014 with two exceptions Q2 operating income for major payers\u2019 insurance divisions\n\nElevance and Molina both said they significantly raised premiums for ACA plans next year, while Centene is currently refiling bids with its ACA states so that it too can raise rates.\n\nUnitedHealthcare could also exit select ACA markets next year if it can\u2019t secure high enough rates, especially given expected membership turmoil, Noel said.\n\nMeanwhile, CVS already said it\u2019ll leave the turbulent ACA exchanges entirely next year.\n\nAll told, the actions will result in fewer choices and higher premiums for ACA enrollees in 2026. Insurers are requesting a median premium increase of 15% next year \u2014 the largest hike since 2018, according to a KFF analysis of preliminary rate filings.\n\nMajor payers are rolling back plans at a time of significant policy uncertainty. The GOP\u2019s recently passed tax and policy law is expected to cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid and ACA coverage, while more generous subsidies for ACA plans are set to expire at the end of this year \u2014 setting up a one-two punch for Americans that rely on government insurance programs.\n\nMeanwhile, many insurers\u2019 stocks have been tanking as investors balk at the challenges facing payers. Credit ratings agencies and investment banks have downgraded several health insurance providers. It\u2019s not surprising then that in this atmosphere, payers are prioritizing profitability over seemingly all else \u2014 including the impact on consumers.\n\nDuring an investor call, Molina CFO Mark Keim summarized the apparent sentiment of major insurers heading into 2026: \u201cWe can prioritize margin and let membership fall where it may.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Humana, CVS profit by cutting benefits; peers face high costs, planned cuts.\n\n**Key details:** Humana and CVS were the only insurers to raise their annual profit expectations following the second quarter. This success stems from their 2024 strategy of slashing Medicare benefits and cutting unprofitable members and geographies. In contrast, four other major payers, including UnitedHealth and Elevance, lowered their profit expectations or established new lower targets. UnitedHealth, which expanded its Medicare Advantage (MA) membership, significantly underestimated accelerating medical trends, leading to higher costs.\n\n**Why it matters:** This development challenges a potential consensus that broad Medicare Advantage expansion would be a universally beneficial strategy amidst rising medical costs. It demonstrates that Humana and CVS's prior retrenchment, prioritizing profitability over growth, has proven more effective in the current environment than UnitedHealth's growth strategy. Consequently, other major payers that underestimated costs are now planning significant benefit cuts and market exits for 2026 to recover earnings, indicating a widespread industry shift towards profitability over membership volume.\n\n**The big picture:** The health insurance industry is grappling with a \"tidal wave of medical costs\" and reduced reimbursement in privatized Medicare programs due to Biden administration policies. Insurers are also facing sharply rising costs in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans, driven by increased spending and members' health needs. Amidst these financial pressures, and with many insurers' stocks declining, payers are intensely prioritizing profitability, even if it leads to fewer choices and higher premiums for consumers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Humana\u2019s MA membership dropped by more than 400,000 people since the end of 2024.\n*   CVS\u2019 MA membership fell by more than 200,000 people since the end of 2024.\n*   UnitedHealthcare added over 500,000 MA members in the first half of 2025.\n*   UnitedHealthcare plans to exit plans serving over 600,000 members for 2026.\n*   Insurers are requesting a median premium increase of 15% for ACA plans next year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Humana:** Raised annual profit expectations after slashing Medicare benefits and cutting unprofitable members.\n*   **CVS:** Raised annual profit expectations due to rationalizing products and geographies.\n*   **UnitedHealth:** Lowered profit expectations, added MA members, and plans aggressive 2026 market exits.\n*   **Elevance:** Lowered profit expectations due to rising costs, raised ACA plan premiums for next year.\n*   **Centene:** Lowered profit expectations, planning to raise rates for its ACA plans.\n*   **Molina:** Lowered profit expectations, reported higher medical loss ratio in Medicare Advantage.\n*   **Cigna:** Reaffirmed its previous outlook, does not participate in Medicare Advantage.\n*   **Aetna:** Rationalized products and geographies last year, resulting in an \"optimal\" Medicare membership mix.\n*   **Steve Nelson:** President of Aetna, described Aetna\u2019s Medicare membership mix as \"optimal.\"\n*   **Tim Noel:** Head of UnitedHealthcare, stated Medicare is the biggest driver of lower 2025 earnings.\n*   **George Renaudin:** President of Humana\u2019s insurance segment, credited business reduction for strong performance.\n*   **Mark Keim:** Molina CFO, summarized the insurer sentiment of prioritizing margin over membership for 2026.\n*   **KFF:** Health policy think tank, provided analysis on MA plan options and ACA premium filings.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for major payers to scale back benefits and exit additional markets in 2026.\n*   The expiration of more generous ACA plan subsidies at the end of this year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Insurers are sacrificing growth for profitability, leading to fewer consumer choices and higher premiums.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Trump administration acted illegally when it delayed and canceled billions of dollars of biomedical research grants, despite Congress appropriating funds to the National Institutes of Health, the Government Accountability Office said on Tuesday.\n\nBetween February and June, the watchdog agency estimates the NIH awarded about $8 billion less in funds for research grants and awards compared to the prior year and cut more than 1,800 active grants as it attempted to follow President Donald Trump\u2019s directive to weed out \u201cequity-related\u201d projects.\n\nTrump\u2019s directive to weed out \u201cequity-related\u201d projects. The GAO\u2019s report concludes the administration violated the Impoundment Control Act, which requires the president to provide notice before delaying or blocking congressionally directed spending. GAO can file a lawsuit in an attempt to restore the grants. However, the watchdog agency has not yet opted to do so in its dealings with Trump.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNIH grants came under scrutiny this winter following a series of executive orders directing federal agencies to terminate \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts, federal funding of projects supporting \u201cgender ideology\u201d and DEI programs.\n\nThe NIH began carrying out these directives in February. In addition to the grant cuts, the agency also dragged its feet on approving new projects, GAO found. From late January to early March, the NIH paused grant reviews entirely, delaying funds from being allocated to hospitals and universities.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, a spokesperson for the HHS referred Healthcare Dive to the agency\u2019s testimony to GAO. The testimony states that NIH has since \u201cmoved rapidly to reschedule and hold meetings impacted by the short pause, and to process grant applications.\u201d\n\nThe HHS said between March 24 and June 30, NIH scheduled or held 837 peer review meetings \u2014 186 more than for the same period the year prior.\n\nStill, GAO said that the department hadn\u2019t adequately explained its decision to pause the review process in the first place, despite its resumption of grant review.\n\n\u201cIf the executive branch wishes to make changes to the appropriation provided to NIH, it must propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,\u201d the watchdog group wrote in its report. The HHS had done neither, the GAO said, adding: \u201cIn short, HHS has offered no evidence that it did not withhold amounts from obligation or expenditure, and it has not shown that the delay was a permissible programmatic one.\u201d\n\nThe report also suggests the Trump administration may be continuing efforts to block NIH funds from flowing to medical research.\n\nThe office said the Office of Management and Budget asked NIH to \u201cpause the issuing of grants, research contracts and training\u201d in late July. There are reports that decision was later reversed, but GAO said it could not confirm whether the pause was lifted.\n\nFollowing the release of the report, Democratic lawmakers called for the Trump administration to resume funding NIH grants as Congress specified, warning that medical research progress is at stake.\n\n\u201cCutting off investments Congress has made into research that saves millions of lives is as backward and as inexcusable as it gets,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in a statement. \u201cIt is critical President Trump reverse course, stop decimating the NIH, and get every last bit of this funding out.\u201d\n\nThis report is not the first time Trump\u2019s funding cuts have been challenged.\n\nResearchers, unions and a coalition of 16 states sued over the NIH cuts, with academics saying they needed the funds to perform critical medical research, including learning about alcohol\u2019s impact on Alzheimer\u2019s risk and suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness. In June, a U.S. district judge ordered the NIH to reinstate the plaintiffs\u2019 canceled funds. However, litigation remains ongoing after the Trump administration appealed that ruling.\n\nGAO has the potential to bring its own suit against the NIH, but it will likely be a last resort, according to reporting by the New York Times.

This action violated the Impoundment Control Act, which requires presidential notice for blocking congressionally directed spending. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded approximately $8 billion less in funds and cut over 1,800 active grants from February to June. These cuts followed President Donald Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate \"equity-related\" projects, and NIH also paused grant reviews entirely for a period.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information challenges the consensus that federal research funding is a stable and predictable source for the biomedical sector. The GAO's finding of illegal actions and violations of the Impoundment Control Act indicates a direct disruption to congressionally appropriated funds. Such unpredictability in funding could significantly impact medical research progress and the financial stability of companies and institutions reliant on NIH grants. Democratic lawmakers warn that cutting these investments jeopardizes research that saves lives, as academics need the funds for critical medical research.\n\n**The big picture:**\nNIH grants came under scrutiny after executive orders directed federal agencies to terminate grants supporting \"equity-related\" projects, \"gender ideology,\" and DEI programs. The NIH began implementing these directives in February, resulting in grant cuts and a pause in approving new projects. While the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated NIH has since rescheduled meetings and processed applications, the GAO found no adequate explanation for the initial pause. This report marks another instance of Trump administration funding cuts being challenged, with ongoing litigation from researchers and states.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Approximately $8 billion less in NIH research funds awarded (February-June)\n*   Over 1,800 active NIH grants cut\n*   837 peer review meetings scheduled or held by NIH (March 24-June 30)\n*   186 more peer review meetings in that period than the prior year\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Trump administration:** Acted illegally by delaying and canceling billions in NIH biomedical research grants.\n*   **Government Accountability Office (GAO):** Watchdog agency concluding the administration's actions were illegal and a violation of law.\n*   **National Institutes of Health (NIH):** Federal agency whose biomedical research grants were subjected to illegal delays and cuts.\n*   **Congress:** Appropriated funds to NIH, which the administration illegally withheld and delayed.\n*   **HHS:** Referred to testimony stating NIH resumed processing applications after a short pause.\n*   **Office of Management and Budget (OMB):** Asked NIH to pause issuing grants, research contracts, and training in late July.\n*   **Sen.

Most of these dually classified facilities were nonprofits, including some large, urban academic medical centers.\n\nThe trend is likely to continue without intervention from lawmakers, potentially increasing Medicare spending on geographically urban hospitals \u2014 even as many rural facilities struggle financially and are at high risk of closure, the researchers wrote.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCongress has implemented a number of policies over the past four decades to boost access to care for rural Americans, who tend to be older and sicker compared with their urban counterparts. The policies are also meant to benefit rural hospitals, which tend to operate on slim margins, making them vulnerable to service reductions or closures.\n\nFor example, hospitals classified as rural for payment purposes by the CMS can apply for sole community hospital or rural referral center status, which garners higher reimbursement rates from Medicare, according to the Health Affairs study.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s easier for rural hospitals to become eligible for the 340B drug discount program, and they receive more graduate medical education slots for training new physicians.\n\nIn 1999, Congress allowed hospitals in urban areas to classify as rural facilities for administrative purposes. Lawmakers argued some hospitals may be technically located in metropolitan areas but still serve rural communities, so they should be able to benefit from government programs that aim to improve rural health.\n\nStill, the CMS used rulemaking to ensure hospitals that chose this option couldn\u2019t reclassify themselves back to urban status, so they couldn\u2019t also receive money from higher urban wage indexes and an add-on payment to Medicare disproportionate share payments reserved for urban hospitals.\n\nBut that changed in 2016 due to two appellate court rulings, pushing the CMS to change regulations so facilities could be classified as urban and rural simultaneously \u2014 allowing them to take advantage of benefits for both hospital types, researchers said.\n\nThe share of administratively rural hospitals among all acute care, non-critical access hospitals increased from 27% in 2013 to 43% in 2023, according to the study.\n\nDuring that same time period, the share of administratively rural hospital beds rose significantly, from just 13% in 2023 to 45% a decade later, suggesting that newer administrative rural hospitals are much larger.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of geographically urban hospitals and the number of beds at these facilities held relatively stable.\n\nDually classified hospitals were most common in states in the East Coast, like Connecticut, Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. They weren\u2019t as prevalent in central and Southern states. For example, Montana, Nebraska and Wyoming had no dually qualified facilities.\n\nAdditionally, many of the dually classified hospitals with the highest net patient revenue \u2014 like NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, Cleveland Clinic Hospital and AdventHealth Orlando \u2014 were located in large metropolitan areas like New York City and Los Angeles, according to the research.\n\nThe rise in dually classified hospitals could have significant implications for government healthcare programs, like 340B, which allows healthcare providers that serve large populations of low-income patients to buy outpatient drugs at a significantly discounted rate, researchers said. Dually classified hospitals could effectively provide services for fewer low-income patients and still qualify.",

This administrative reclassification boosts their Medicare reimbursement rates. The number of such hospitals surged from three in 2017 to 425 in 2023. Most are nonprofits, including large, urban academic medical centers, benefiting from a 2016 regulatory change allowing simultaneous urban and rural classification.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis trend is expected to continue without lawmaker intervention, potentially increasing Medicare spending on geographically urban hospitals.

Rural classification provides benefits like higher Medicare reimbursement rates (e.g., sole community hospital status) and easier eligibility for the 340B drug discount program.

In response to the survey, AHIP, the major lobby for insurers, said that drugmakers set prescription drug prices at unaffordable levels, placing employers in a difficult spot.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSpending on specialty drugs, which treat rare, complex and chronic health conditions, has been skyrocketing among rising rates of the conditions and as more expensive drugs enter the market. Though fewer than 5% of the population uses specialty drugs, the medications account for at least half of pharmaceutical spending in recent years, according to CarelonRx, the health services arm of insurer Elevance.\n\nRising spending on pricey pharmaceuticals has led insurers to lean on utilization management controls like prior authorizations to try and keep a handle on costs. However, that\u2019s complicated access for patients who need specialty drugs, including in employer-sponsored plans, which cover the majority of Americans.\n\nFifty-four percent of adults covered by private plans were told by their insurer that their medication was no longer covered, according to the PAN Foundation\u2019s survey of roughly 2,000 U.S. adults in mid-July.\n\nIn addition, almost half of such adults said their plan referred them to a third party to help them obtain the medications, through measures like importing the drug from a different country or securing it through a drugmaker\u2019s patient assistance program or charity.\n\nSuch AFPs save employer-sponsored health plans money, since they don\u2019t have to cover expensive specialty medications themselves. But AFPs are controversial. The arrangements are often provided by for-profit companies that profit by keeping a portion of the money collected from assistance programs as a fee, according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation.\n\nPatient may have to agree to restrictive terms. And, any amount they pay for their drug through the program may not count towards annual out-of-pocket cost sharing limits, saddling patients with a higher financial burden.\n\nAFPs can also result in delays compared to straightforward insurance coverage. Among patients who elected to work with an external company, more than one-third experienced a delay of one month or longer in receiving their medication \u2014 impacting their mental and physical health, worsening downstream health needs and causing other challenges, the PAN Foundation said.\n\nNearly all adults \u2014 92% \u2014 said they were negatively impacted by the delays. And for many, the disturbance was unnecessary. Almost half of patients said that ultimately their medication was once again covered through their health insurance plan.\n\nAmy Niles, the PAN Foundation\u2019s chief mission officer, called the findings \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our research indicate how prevalent these practices are,\u201d Niles said.\n\nStill, in an environment where drug companies set ever higher list prices, employers may be forced to contract outside of their plan to obtain alternative access to the medications they simply can\u2019t afford, insurance groups argue.\n\n\u201cNo one has more control over prescription drug prices than drugmakers. They alone set prices \u2014 and they alone can lower them. Yet they keep raising prices year after year, driving up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for patients and employers,\u201d a spokesperson for AHIP said over email.\n\nRising costs are employers\u2019 No. 1 benefits concern this year, according to consultancy WTW. Estimates of how steeply healthcare costs will increase for employers in 2025 vary but generally range from 6% to 9%, forcing them to shift more costs onto their employees.\n\nEmployers have chalked the increase in medical spend to factors like inflation, higher negotiated prices from providers \u2014 and specialty drugs.",

This is partly due to the high prevalence of alternative funding programs (AFPs), where plans outsource access to expensive drugs. While AFPs save employer-sponsored health plans money, nearly half of affected patients were referred to third parties to obtain medications. These arrangements can cause delays of a month or longer, negatively impacting patient health and access.\n\n**Why it matters:** Rising spending on specialty drugs, now accounting for at least half of pharmaceutical spending, is driving insurers and employers to implement controversial cost-saving tactics like AFPs. This information challenges a simple view of comprehensive insurance coverage, showing plans are increasingly outsourcing high-cost medication access.

While some providers initially sought to push back against the administration\u2019s crackdown on gender-affirming care this winter, more recently major health systems including the Cleveland Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Mount Sinai and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have elected to pause youth gender-affirming care services, citing political pressure. Many of these closures are happening in states where gender-affirming care is protected by state law.\n\nThe White House celebrated health systems ending services in a statement last month as a sign their policies were working as intended.\n\nHowever, the states say that the Trump administration\u2019s policies violate the 10th Amendment, which says that powers or rights not explicitly belonging to the federal government belong to states or individuals, because transgender healthcare is legally protected in their states.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Gates Foundation on Monday said it is committing to invest $2.5 billion over the next five years to accelerate research and development in neglected areas of women\u2019s health.\n\nThe funding will be channeled toward five priority areas of research that are particularly important to low- and middle-income countries. Among the targets for investment are contraception, maternal health, obstetric care, maternal immunization and sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest investment we\u2019ve ever made in women\u2019s health research and development, but it still falls far short of what is needed in a neglected and underfunded area of huge human need and opportunity,\u201d Anita Zaidi, president of the Gates Foundation\u2019s Gender Equality Division, said in a statement.\n\nHealth conditions that primarily or disproportionately affect women have long been neglected. Lack of investment often slows the research necessary for biotechnology companies to develop new medicines, leaving common disorders such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome and preeclampsia without good treatment options.\n\nThe Gates Foundation highlighted non-hormonal contraception, preeclampsia treatment and research into the vaginal microbiome as areas of \u201cbreakthrough potential.\u201d\n\nSome of the investment will also go to supporting data collection and advocacy when products are approved for market.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey Health Institute report, closing the gender health gap could boost the global economy by $1 trillion annually by 2040.\n\n\u201cThis commitment brings much-needed attention to the health challenges women face in places where resources are most limited and the burden is highest. It reflects a recognition that women\u2019s lives\u2014and the innovations that support them\u2014must be prioritized everywhere,\u201d said Bosede Afolabi, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the College of Medicine at the University of Lagos, in a statement provided by the foundation.\n\nThe Gates Foundation is also urging public and private sectors to co-invest in \u201cwomen\u2019s health innovations, [to] help shape product development, and ensure access to treatments for the women and girls who need them most.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d said Ru-fong Cheng, director of Women\u2019s Health Innovation at the Gates Foundation, in an email to BioPharma Dive. \u201cAddressing the health needs of all women will require more co-investment from the private sector, investors, philanthropy and others. It\u2019s so important because when we improve health outcomes for women, not only do they have the opportunity to live fuller lives, but we can also strengthen entire families, communities and economies.\u201d\n\nWhile private investment in women\u2019s health research has increased in the U.S., the field faces threats from funding cuts, federal layoffs and new policies that worry physicians, researchers and other experts.\n\nThe new commitment from the Gates Foundation are also designed to support the organization\u2019s 2045 goals, which aim to end preventable deaths of mothers and infants.",

This funding, the largest ever from the foundation in this area, targets five priority areas including contraception, maternal health, obstetric care, maternal immunization, and sexually transmitted infections. A portion of the investment will also support data collection and advocacy for products approved for market.\n\n**Why it matters:** This significant investment aims to accelerate R&D in a historically neglected and underfunded area of women's health, addressing common disorders that lack treatment options. The article suggests this area presents a \"huge human need and opportunity.\" According to a McKinsey Health Institute report, closing the gender health gap could boost the global economy by $1 trillion annually by 2040, indicating a potential for substantial economic return on investment. This commitment challenges the historical consensus of underinvestment, pointing to potential \"breakthrough potential\" in areas like non-hormonal contraception and preeclampsia treatment, which could attract further private sector co-investment.\n\n**The big picture:** Health conditions primarily affecting women have historically been neglected, leading to slow research for new medicines and a lack of good treatment options for common disorders.

However, gains weren\u2019t equally spread among providers.\n\nThe gender pay gap widened, with average compensation climbing higher for men at 5.7% year over year, while women\u2019s pay rose just 1.7%. Some specialties also brought home more than others \u2014 hematologists and oncologists brought in 93% more than pediatricians.\n\nhigher for men at 5.7% year over year, while women\u2019s pay rose just 1.7%. Some specialties also brought home more than others \u2014 hematologists and oncologists brought in 93% more than pediatricians. The report comes as providers say they need more money to combat inadequate reimbursement rates, especially from public payers. Eighty-one percent of physicians surveyed by Doximity said reimbursement policies have played a role in the decline of independent practices nationwide.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Doximity report pulls insights from more than 37,000 physician surveys completed between January and December 2024, and leverages additional data from more than 230,000 surveys completed over the past six years to see how physicians across the country are paid \u2014 and how they feel about it.\n\nProviders say they\u2019re grappling with entrenched problems, including staffing challenges and what they call inadequate reimbursement from payers. They\u2019re also preparing for new problems, like looming cuts to Medicaid.\n\nNearly 60% of physicians surveyed by Doximity in June said they were concerned that financial pressures from low reimbursements could impact their ability to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients within the next year. Already, 17% had reduced the number of Medicare of Medicaid patients they saw as a result of the financial stress.\n\nDr. Amit Phull, chief clinical experience officer at Doximity, said in a statement that the surveys show physicians are \u201cunder strain.\u201d He warns that not all specialties are faring equally.\n\n\u201cPediatricians and pediatric subspecialists, in particular, are facing acute challenges. They\u2019re caring for some of the most vulnerable and complex patients in medicine, yet persistently lower pay and reimbursement threaten both workforce stability and patient access to care,\u201d Phull said.\n\nThe report warns pediatricians are generally undercompensated for their work relative to their peers in adult specialties.\n\nPediatric endocrinologists, for example, had an average salary of $230,000, while general endocrinologists make an average of $290,606. Pediatric rheumatologists made $231,574, while general rheumatologists made $324,954.\n\nThe report attributed some of the difference in pay to reimbursement differences between pediatrics and adult specialties, noting pediatrics tends to have \u201clow profit margins or no margins at all\u201d due to a lack of parity in reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn a separate Doximity survey of more than 1,200 pediatricians this year, the majority of respondents said they are not fairly compensated relative to the complexity of their work, and almost 70% said financial challenges were forcing them to consider making a career change.\n\nHalf of pediatricians surveyed said inadequate reimbursement was also posing problems at the bedside and impacting their ability to provide the best patient care. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they had made moderate or significant changes to their practice model, including reducing services or cutting staff, to cope with financial pressures.",

However, the gender pay gap widened, with men's average compensation climbing 5.7% while women's rose just 1.7%. Compensation gains were also uneven among specialties, as hematologists and oncologists brought in 93% more than pediatricians. The report attributes some pay differences to reimbursement disparities, noting pediatricians are generally undercompensated relative to adult specialties.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe modest overall pay increase masks significant, widening disparities in compensation across gender and specialties within the medical field. This challenges any consensus view that a general pay bump alleviates financial pressures for all physicians or resolves underlying systemic issues. The report highlights that inadequate reimbursement policies contribute to the decline of independent practices and impact physicians' ability to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients. Specifically, pediatricians face acute financial challenges, which threatens both workforce stability and patient access to vulnerable care.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Doximity report pulls insights from over 37,000 physician surveys completed between January and December 2024, supplementing data from 230,000 surveys over six years. This data arrives as providers consistently report grappling with entrenched problems, including staffing challenges and what they deem inadequate reimbursement from payers.

Choice lowered its full-year 2025 domestic RevPAR guidance, now expecting growth in the range of -3% to 0%, down from a previous forecast range of -1% to 1%.\n\nChoice\u2019s domestic extended stay portfolio was a bright spot in the quarter, seeing solid RevPAR results and development momentum.

Domestic RevPAR for Choice\u2019s extended stay portfolio outperformed the total lodging industry by 40 basis points during the quarter, per the earnings report.\n\nOn the development front, Choice\u2019s domestic upscale, extended stay and midscale rooms portfolio increased 2.3% year over year in the quarter. And Choice\u2019s WoodSpring Suites extended stay brand, specifically, grew its rooms 9.7% year on year in Q2.\n\nMeanwhile, Choice\u2019s upscale brands, which the company has strategically expanded over the last couple of years, saw 14.7% year-over-year growth in global rooms.\n\nChoice\u2019s international system size grew 5% year over year in the second quarter.

Choice\u2019s $112 million acquisition of the remaining interest in Choice Hotels Canada, which was made public Aug. 6, expands its offerings in the country from eight to all 22 of its brands.\n\nCanada provides particularly strong opportunities in the extended stay segment, which will be supported by Choice\u2019s long history with existing franchisees in the region, Pacious said on the call.\n\nChoice\u2019s expansion in Canada comes after several U.S. hotel operators, including Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International, reported a decline in inbound Canadian tourism in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe two main headwinds causing a softer domestic RevPAR environment industrywide, Pacious said, are declines in international inbound and government travel.\n\nAs of May, the U.S. was on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025 following recent government actions, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.\n\nMacroeconomic volatility in Q2 resulted in less-than-stellar U.S. RevPAR results for Choice competitors Hilton, Marriott International and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.",

However, Choice's domestic extended stay portfolio saw solid RevPAR and development, and its international portfolio also grew.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe decreased revenues and lowered domestic RevPAR guidance signal a challenging operating environment for Choice Hotels in the U.S. This information might challenge a consensus view of stable or recovering domestic lodging, as macroeconomic volatility also led to \"less-than-stellar\" U.S. RevPAR results for competitors.

In this role, Dingle will lead the firm's development team and strategy across all property types and geographies. He joins Stonebridge from Aimbridge Hospitality, where he was senior vice president of business development for nearly a decade. Dingle also held positions at Crow Holdings and co-founded Compass Lodging Advisors.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis appointment signals Stonebridge's commitment to aggressive development and growth. Dingle's expertise is intended to advance the firm's \"tremendous growth prospects.\" The move follows Stonebridge's $60 million acquisition of Real Hospitality Group, a type of M&A JLL expects to increase in the sector. This proactive expansion, coupled with previous hires from a competitor, challenges any consensus view that the third-party hotel management space might be consolidating slowly, indicating a potentially accelerated M&A environment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nStonebridge Companies is a Denver-based hotel management firm with a portfolio of over 160 hotels across more than 20 states. The company has been actively building its executive team, recently hiring Rob Smith as CEO and Adam Snow as EVP and chief strategy officer, both also from Aimbridge Hospitality. This leadership strengthening comes as nearly half of all branded hotels are now managed by third parties.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMarriott International posted 1.5% year-over-year growth in global RevPAR for the second quarter of 2025, representing 5.3% growth in international markets and flat performance in the U.S. and Canada amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty in the region, according to an earnings report published Tuesday.\n\nAlso during the quarter, the hotel company added roughly 17,300 rooms, growing its net rooms 4.7% year over year. The company\u2019s development pipeline reached a record, exceeding 590,000 rooms, per the report.\n\nDespite gains on the development side, Marriott now anticipates full-year 2025 RevPAR growth at the low end of its prior guidance, CEO Anthony Capuano shared on a Tuesday earnings call. He attributed Marriott\u2019s flat U.S. RevPAR results to a decline in select service demand, \u201clargely reflecting reduced government travel and weaker business transient demand.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMarriott now expects full-year 2025 RevPAR growth in the range of 1.5% and 2.5%, at the low end of its previously forecast growth range of 1.5% to 3.5%. This outlook comes as economic uncertainty persists following recent U.S. government actions, including trade policy shifts. Some uncertainty, though, has been eased after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law last month, Capuano noted on the earnings call.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, the best thing about the Big Beautiful Bill is it\u2019s done. The level of uncertainty, both among consumers and among our owners and franchisees, improves meaningfully with the signature on that bill,\u201d Capuano said.\n\n\u201cThe stability that comes from no more talk about it and the implementation of the various components of that bill are a net positive for us,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith that said, the factors that our owners consider as they think about putting shovels in the ground are all around yields, and so to the extent that there remains uncertainty around tariffs, that will give them some measure of pause.\u201d\n\nEconomic uncertainty negatively impacted Marriott\u2019s results in the second quarter, according to Capuano. The company\u2019s Q2 RevPAR growth in the U.S. and Canada was strongest in the luxury segment, though it \u201cweakened going down the chain scales, where results came in below our prior expectations,\u201d he shared on the call.\n\nThe company saw less-than-stellar results in the select service and extended stay segments, \u201cprimarily due to a decline in government demand, as two-thirds of [Marriott\u2019s] government revenues are in the select service segment,\u201d Capuano said.\n\nMarriott CFO Leeny Oberg, who announced during the quarter that she will retire in 2026, said that government room nights in the U.S. and Canada were down 16% year over year in Q2.\n\nGroup RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was also \u201csofter than previously anticipated, primarily due to fewer near-term bookings and elevated attrition rates,\u201d according to Capuano.\n\nCaesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg similarly noted during a Q2 earnings call that the operator saw its Las Vegas segment booking window contract in Q2, resulting in softer earnings results.\n\nMeanwhile, in June, CoStar and Tourism Economics downgraded their 2025 and 2026 growth projections for U.S. hotel top-line performance metrics, including RevPAR, citing elevated macroeconomic concerns.\n\nFor Marriott, group bookings for future periods have strengthened, though, \u201cwith group revenues for 2026 pacing up 8% in the U.S. and Canada,\u201d Oberg shared.\n\nCapuano also said he remains optimistic about growth on the development front.\n\n\u201cWe still expect strong net rooms growth in 2025 and beyond, as owners continue to show preference for our brands, even with higher construction costs and the challenging financing environment in the U.S. and Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth is expected to be driven in part by Marriott\u2019s two new brands: its recently launched collection brand, Series by Marriott, and its recently acquired lifestyle brand, CitizenM.",

The company added approximately 17,300 rooms, increasing its net rooms by 4.7% year-over-year, and its development pipeline reached a record exceeding 590,000 rooms. Despite development gains, Marriott now anticipates full-year 2025 RevPAR growth at the low end of its prior guidance. CEO Anthony Capuano attributed flat U.S. RevPAR to declining select service demand, primarily from reduced government and weaker business transient travel.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nMarriott now expects full-year 2025 RevPAR growth between 1.5% and 2.5%, a reduction from its previous forecast of 1.5% to 3.5%. This downward revision signals persistent economic uncertainty and the impact of U.S. government actions like trade policy shifts. The flat U.S. performance, particularly in select service and extended stay segments, fell below Marriott's prior expectations, indicating a challenging environment for certain domestic travel sectors.

Together, the upscale and upper midscale segments comprised 59% of all projects in the total pipeline in the quarter, the report detailed.\n\nLodging Econometrics also noted that the upper upscale project pipeline experienced notable growth in Q2, increasing 11% year over year to 360 projects. Upper-tier categories had a leg up over other chain scales in the first quarter this year as well.\n\nMeanwhile, extended stay brands continued to remain popular with developers, accounting for 38% of the projects under construction, 43% of those scheduled to begin within the next 12 months and 37% of projects in the early planning stage, according to Lodging Econometrics.\n\nThe total extended stay pipeline stood at 2,473 projects, representing 39% of the total pipeline and increasing 3% year over year.\n\nEarlier this year, Choice Hotels International CEO Patrick Pacious said extended stay and upscale limited service are the two segments with the highest developer and guest demand.\n\nHotel markets to watch\n\nDallas had the largest hotel construction pipeline of any U.S. market at the close of the second quarter, with 199 projects and a record 24,497 rooms, according to Lodging Economics. Dallas\u2019 Q2 rooms pipeline was only one room larger than in Q1, though, when it comprised 24,496 rooms.

New York City is forecast to open another 23 new hotels in the second half of the year, the most of any market, per Lodging Econometrics.\n\nNotable hotels opening this year in New York City include Waldorf Astoria New York and W New York - Union Square.\n\nLooking ahead, Lodging Econometrics projects 823 new U.S. hotels will open nationwide in 2026, increasing 1.6% year over year, and 902 hotels will open in 2027, representing 1.7% annual supply growth that year.",

Munchkin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a previous case filed in the same court, a former Taco Bell cashier said the company allegedly didn\u2019t take action after she was threatened by co-workers for reporting misconduct at a restaurant Christmas party at which her colleagues were openly having sex.\n\nIn that case, the employee\u2019s lawsuit alleged discrimination, sexual harassment, a hostile work environment, retaliation and failure to investigate under FEHA and the California Labor Code.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEmployee referral programs can be a benefit to hiring managers. Not only do employees identify potential candidates and eliminate the need for extensive searches and/or shuffling through mountains of resumes, but employees are also rewarded for their role in the process, in turn boosting their morale, experts told HR Dive.\n\nBut not all referral programs are doing what they\u2019ve set out to do. According to research from HireClix, 71% of companies have formal referral programs, but only 2% are meeting their referral hiring goals.\n\nFixing employee referral programs can be a big boost for hiring, especially when hiring managers are often inundated with candidates for open positions, said Moe Hutt, director of strategic consulting services at HireClix. It\u2019s a problem made worse by people using AI to throw as many resumes into the world as possible, even if they\u2019re not qualified (not to mention that people applying for these jobs may not be who they say they are).\n\nA healthy employee referral program means \u201cthere\u2019s comfort that someone knows this person. It helps them jump to the front of the line without a lot of administrative burden and bureaucracy,\u201d she said.\n\nHere\u2019s how to find pain points in underperforming employee referral programs, and how to fix them, to add another important tool to the employee search process.\n\nGood intentions, gummed up works\n\nWhen it comes to employee referral programs, three things typically trip them up, said Hutt, which have all been persistent problems, even with the digital transformation of the hiring process. \u201cYou could give me the same interview 20 years ago, and I\u2019d start by saying the same thing.\u201d\n\nThey all have to do with process, she\u2019s found. First, employees don\u2019t clearly know the job requirements for the positions posted. Second, the steps they need to take to submit a referral are too complex. And third, the employee and the person they\u2019re referring for the job aren\u2019t kept in the loop about where that person is in the hiring process.\n\nCompanies don\u2019t want employees to go through the trouble of referring good people and then experiencing radio silence. \u201cIt\u2019s a black hole. I never hear back, and my friend never hears back and I\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d Hutt said.\n\nSome complexities in such programs might have come from a good place, she added, especially if a company found fraud in the previous system, like a manager claiming a bonus when a person they managed was the one to make the referral. But too many clicks and too many steps have made the process unmanageable.\n\nOne factor that\u2019s rarely a problem is the actual value of the referral bonus. According to the same HireClix study, over 80% of companies with referral programs pay cash bonuses averaging over $1,000 to employees who refer successful candidates.\n\nRighting the employee referral program ship\n\nFor companies that aren\u2019t seeing the results they want from their employee referral programs, they can start by looking at if their employees actually know about it, said Elysca Fernandes, director with McLean & Co.\u2019s HR research & advisory services team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of promises of strong referral programs, but in practice it\u2019s rare to have resources committed to marketing it,\u201d she said. That includes employees who do refer someone. \u201cA lot of people refer once and never hear back. The silence itself really detracts from them ever using it again.\u201d\n\nEmployees may also not be referring if they just don\u2019t like where they work. Why bring a family member or friend into a mess? A floundering employee referral program could be a red warning light that there\u2019s a bigger problem at an organization.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I usually recommend to talent acquisition folks is it\u2019s not going to be worth your while to focus on referral programs on their own without focusing on the employee experience,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cPeople need to see that the organization cares about them and it\u2019s a good place to work before they promote it outward.\u201d\n\nEmployee referral programs may also need to shift what the reward for the employee is for, said Hutt. Organizing focus groups on the topic might help a company realize that instead of a cash bonus, employees might instead find an extra day of PTO a better incentive, or an experience or vacation package.\n\nWhen done properly, employee referral programs are \u201cpretty affordable,\u201d added Hutt, and can deliver high bang for your buck, even if the actual bonus is high. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be your most expensive source, and it ends up becoming your best source. With all of those things together, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Company Referral Programs Largely Fail, Draining Hiring Efficiency\n\n**Key details:**\nKey details: Despite 71% of companies having formal employee referral programs, only 2% are meeting their hiring goals. The primary issues stem from process complexities, including unclear job requirements, difficult submission steps, and a lack of communication with referrers and candidates. Over 80% of companies offer cash bonuses averaging over $1,000, but the bonus value is rarely the problem. Other significant factors include poor program marketing and an overall negative employee experience.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhy it matters: This challenges the common assumption that referral programs are inherently efficient and cost-effective hiring tools. While seen as \"no-brainers\" and potentially a company's \"best source\" for talent, their widespread underperformance indicates a significant missed opportunity for optimizing recruitment. Companies are likely investing in programs that are not delivering expected returns, suggesting internal inefficiencies or deeper issues with employee satisfaction. Fixing these programs offers a substantial \"bang for your buck,\" transforming a failing system into a highly valuable hiring channel.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe big picture: Employee referral programs are intended to benefit hiring managers by identifying candidates, reducing extensive searches, and boosting employee morale. In an era where hiring managers face an influx of candidates, partly due to AI-generated resumes, effective referral programs are crucial. However, the problems plaguing these programs, particularly process-related issues like complexity and lack of communication, have been persistent for decades, even with digital advancements in hiring.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   71% of companies have formal referral programs.\n*   Only 2% of companies meet their referral hiring goals.\n*   Over 80% of companies with referral programs pay cash bonuses.\n*   Cash bonuses average over $1,000.\n\n**Key Players:**\nKey Players:\n*   **HireClix:** Conducted research indicating the low success rate of company referral programs.\n*   **Moe Hutt:** Director at HireClix, identified persistent process-related issues that hinder referral programs.\n*   **McLean & Co.:** Employer of an expert advising companies on improving referral programs through marketing and employee experience.\n*   **Elysca Fernandes:** Director at McLean & Co., recommends focusing on program marketing and overall employee experience for success.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nLooking Forward: Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe Bottom Line: Underperforming referral programs waste resources; optimizing them offers a powerful hiring advantage.",

Researchers say the problem is too many demands on women, from money-related issues to caregiving responsibilities, to the intersection of the two.\n\nOnly 29% of women said they are very good or excellent at managing their finances, compared to 37% of men. \u201cFinancial health drives overall well-being \u2014 it really has an outsized impact on overall well-being, and people don\u2019t necessarily think about that,\u201d Gene Lanzoni, second vice president of enterprise content marketing told HR Dive.\n\n\u201cAnd we know financial challenges are particularly pronounced for women who are caregivers whether they\u2019re caring for elderly relatives or whether they\u2019re caring for small children,\u201d Lanzoni added.\n\nHere\u2019s what HR needs to know about the state of women in the workplace, and what HR can do to improve half their workforce\u2019s outcomes and business productivity.\n\nThe problems plaguing women\n\nOf the respondents to Guardian\u2019s survey, 38% of caregivers said their family is living paycheck to paycheck; forty-two percent of single mothers said the same.\n\n\u201cMoney and finances, cost of living, mental health, paying off debt, saving for retirement and housing costs were all things that women particularly mentioned as being major stressors,\u201d Lanzoni highlighted.\n\nAnalysis showed that while men typically had $11,000 in emergency savings, women only had $6,500 in their emergency fund.\n\nResearchers also suggested that the double strain of being a caregiver \u2014 both emotional and financial \u2014 led to worse physical health. They highlighted, for example, that women were more likely than men to skip medical care due to cost.\n\n\u201cWhile both men and women face stress, uncertainty and even sometimes turmoil in their life, the impacts seem to be more profound for women,\u201d Lanzoni said.\n\nHow HR can help women workers thrive\n\nOutside of adjusting compensation and benefits packages for workers \u2014 especially in a year when HR\u2019s hands may be tied, financially \u2014 small, free, workplace culture tweaks are an option for improving women\u2019s health outcomes.\n\n\u201cNormalizing conversations around the topics that are often shrouded in silence can help make them less intimidating,\u201d Lanzoni said. \u201cWomen can [then] talk about things like fertility challenges, postpartum depression, menopause, elderly caregiving, [and] being a single working mom.\u201d\n\nErasing the stigma around these conversations is a key starting point, Lanzoni said.\n\nAnother workplace culture tweak is championing flexibility. \u201cThere are so many great learnings that we have from the pandemic in terms of what employers were doing \u2014 and in some cases, forced to do,\u201d Lanzoni said.\n\nOutside of Guardian\u2019s report, research has continually supported this. A 2022 report from Care.com and Mother Honestly indicated that women benefit greatly from flexibility. Conversely, a Lean In executive told HR Dive that men benefit disproportionately from on-site work due to gendered norms.\n\nIncreasing total rewards, such as fertility or menopause benefits, could help combat women\u2019s attrition from the workforce, Lanzoni said.\n\nBased on the report\u2019s findings about women\u2019s financial stressors, Lanzoni additionally suggested supplemental health insurance policies to aid with out-of-pocket costs, medical care-related lodging expenses, accidents and critical illness to retain women. Touching on the mental health aspect of the report, he also spotlighted employee assistance programs.\n\nMainly, the most concrete way to help women saddled with caregiving responsibilities would be to provide paid leave, Lanzoni suggested.\n\n\u201cPolicies like paid leave become really important, because we have federal laws like the FMLA [but] that\u2019s really for job protection,\u201d Lanzoni said, adding that some states are trying to fill in that gap.\n\n\u201cSo many employers, in states where there is no law for paid family and medical leave, are implementing policies to allow for parental bonding leave and family caregiving leave,\u201d he said, adding that it would be a dealbreaker for certain groups, such as Gen Z, to not offer such a benefit.\n\nOverall, in offering best practices for HR to address the problems facing women workers, Lanzoni expressed concern around the downward data trend for women\u2019s well-being. \u201cThat's something I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all like to see reverse,\u201d he said.",

Only 35% of women rated their mental health as \"very good\" or \"excellent,\" with this figure dropping to 15% for those aged 18-29. Financial management also lags, with just 29% of women rating themselves as \"very good\" or \"excellent,\" compared to 37% of men. Caregivers and single mothers are particularly affected, with 38% and 42% respectively living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n**Why it matters:** This decline in women's well-being is linked to issues like financial strain and caregiving responsibilities, impacting business productivity. Financial health is highlighted as having an \"outsized impact\" on overall well-being. The findings suggest a need for employers to implement \"small, free, workplace culture tweaks\" and specific benefits beyond just compensation to retain women workers and improve outcomes. This challenges a consensus that financial well-being is solely an individual concern, positioning it as a critical factor for workforce stability and productivity.\n\n**The big picture:** Researchers indicate that the decline in women's well-being stems from excessive demands, particularly money-related issues and caregiving responsibilities. These financial challenges are especially pronounced for women who are caregivers, often leading to worse physical health and skipped medical care due to cost. The article suggests HR departments can help by adjusting compensation and benefits, implementing workplace culture tweaks, normalizing sensitive conversations, and championing flexibility.

A business may need to provide an exemption to a scheduling policy or a dress code, the commission has explained; and \u201c[i]f it would not pose an undue hardship, the employer must grant the accommodation.\u201d\n\nEEOC\u2019s Monday announcement also could shed some light on the agency\u2019s enforcement tactics under its newly confirmed chair.\n\nThe commission has long used pre-litigation conciliation, describing it as an \u201cefficient, effective, and inexpensive\u201d way to resolve discrimination claims, the agency said in a 2015 technical assistance document.\n\nThe conciliation process has sometimes been frustrating for employers, employer-side law firm Seyfarth Shaw wrote in a 2024 analysis of the agency. District office investigators \u201cfrequently refuse to explain the bases for their findings, decline to consider additional argument from employers, and remain vague about the relief they are seeking in order to resolve the charge,\u201d the firm wrote.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first administration, EEOC proposed a rule that would provide employers facing charges more information during the conciliation process. The rule took effect in early 2021, but was rescinded later that year following a Congressional joint resolution signed by former President Joe Biden. Then-Chair Charlotte Burrows said at the time the action would restore the Commission\u2019s \u201cflexibility to tailor the conciliation process to the facts and circumstances of each case, thus increasing the likelihood of a successful resolution.\u201d\n\nWhile certain elements of the conciliation process remain shrouded in secrecy, Seyfarth determined that employers who engage in the process can expect EEOC to decide its success or failure within three months of its kickoff. The median time spent in conciliation is 53 days, the firm said.\n\nIt is unusual for EEOC to broadcast the results of a conciliation process, as it did with The Teeth Doctors; one benefit of the process, Seyfarth noted, is being able to avoid \u201chaving the EEOC go public with its allegations.\u201d\n\nThe Teeth Doctors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Dental Company Pays $61K, Faces Public Scrutiny Over Discrimination Settlement\n\n**Key details:** The dental company, The Teeth Doctors, will pay $61,000 to resolve a religious discrimination charge. This settlement follows an employee being fired for requesting to wear a scrub skirt due to religious beliefs. The company also committed to increasing supervisor training, updating religious discrimination policies, and posting a worker notice. This resolution was reached through the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) pre-litigation conciliation process.\n\n**Why it matters:** This settlement could signal an intensified focus on religious bias claims by the EEOC under new leadership. The agency's decision to publicly announce this conciliation outcome is unusual, departing from its typical approach of keeping such results private. This new transparency might increase reputational risks for companies facing similar discrimination charges. It challenges the prior understanding that conciliation typically avoids public disclosure, potentially impacting how other employers approach such disputes.\n\n**The big picture:** Federal law mandates employers reasonably accommodate religious beliefs unless it causes undue burden. The EEOC has consistently pursued religious bias enforcement actions, particularly under the previous administration. The agency prefers pre-litigation conciliation as an \"efficient, effective, and inexpensive\" way to resolve claims. However, employers have found this process frustrating due to its perceived secrecy and vagueness from investigators.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$61,000:** Amount The Teeth Doctors will pay in settlement.\n*   **3 months:** Expected maximum time for EEOC to decide conciliation success or failure.\n*   **53 days:** Median time spent in the conciliation process.\n*   **2015:** Year EEOC described conciliation as \"efficient, effective, and inexpensive.\"\n*   **2021:** Year a rule to provide employers more information during conciliation took effect, then was rescinded.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):** Announced the settlement and handles religious discrimination enforcement actions.\n*   **The Teeth Doctors:** Dental company paying $61,000 to settle a religious discrimination charge.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President under whom EEOC pursued several religious bias enforcement actions.\n*   **Joe Biden:** Former President who signed a resolution rescinding a conciliation process rule.\n*   **Charlotte Burrows:** Then-Chair of the EEOC who commented on restoring conciliation process flexibility.\n*   **Seyfarth Shaw:** Employer-side law firm that analyzed the EEOC and conciliation process.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** EEOC publicly settled, signaling tougher, more transparent religious bias enforcement.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn the first half of the year, one word continued to appear in headlines surrounding broad economic and political change: \u201cuncertainty.\u201d Construction Dive\u2019s Uncertainty Series delves into how this lack of clarity is affecting contractors and what the future holds. Click on the links to read previous articles about interest rates and about tariffs.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided an Alabama elementary school construction site on July 23, WKRG5 reported, resulting in the arrest of 11 people.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the latest examples of ICE cracking down on jobsites believed to be employing immigrants unauthorized to work in the U.S.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump used heavy anti-immigration rhetoric, but it was tough to know how much the administration would follow through once in control in the White House. That lack of clarity has cleared somewhat, said Anirban Basu, chief economist for Associated Builders and Contractors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty, but relative to inauguration day, we know more than we did,\u201d said Basu. \u201cWe now know that the Trump administration is very serious about deportations, even among those who do not have misdemeanor or felony convictions.\u201d\n\nProlonged immigration crackdowns could extend project timelines for contractors of all sizes, as well as exacerbate the already high demand for labor, experts told Construction Dive. Nonetheless, industry insiders are optimistic that the administration may change course \u2014 pulling back on deportations or not targeting industries that rely on foreign labor, including agriculture or construction \u2014 before the midterm elections in November 2026.\n\nInitial impact of raids\n\nOnce Trump was elected, the Associated General Contractors of America informed members it would take about five months for the Trump administration to begin ramping up ICE raids, said Brian Turmail, vice president of public affairs and workforce. That did indeed begin to bear out in May and will likely ramp up even more now that ICE has received an infusion of funding, Turmail said.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law July 4, contained what ICE Director Todd Lyons called \u201cunprecedented funding\u201d for the agency.\n\n\u201cWe are warning our members they\u2019re likely to expect even more activity now that they\u2019re better funded and have more resources to use,\u201d Turmail told Construction Dive.\n\nSome action has garnered headlines, like the elementary school jobsite in Alabama. But there have been other immediate chilling effects.\n\nFor example, Turmail said he\u2019s heard of increased callouts or worker absences, perhaps out of employees\u2019 fear of targeted raids. Additionally, contractors have taken to hanging signs indicating no uninvited guests are welcome on the jobsite, or even signs specifically calling out that ICE must have a warrant to visit.\n\nContractors that maintain compliance through the use of I-9 and E-Verify systems have less to worry about, but even those tactics aren\u2019t foolproof, experts say.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that if you\u2019ve done E-Verify, you\u2019ve done I-9, you may still have undocumented workers on your jobsite,\u201d Turmail said. For example, unauthorized workers can use someone else\u2019s Social Security number or use a fabricated form of identification.\n\nAnd that impact is starting to show up for larger firms, according to George Carrillo, co-founder and CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit seeking to advance policy goals for Hispanic construction workers and companies.\n\n\u201cSome of the large general contractors that didn\u2019t necessarily have any sort of worries before, now have worries because some of their jobsites have been hit,\u201d Carrillo told Construction Dive. \u201cAnd so I think as it\u2019s starting to affect more people, it\u2019s starting to change people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Carrillo said he\u2019s heard of \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d wherein unauthorized workers who are not the target of an ICE raid will still find themselves deported when the agency comes to call. On the other hand, Turmail said the opposite, indicating often ICE agents don\u2019t arrest more than the alleged criminals they\u2019re tracking down. That only further adds to the murkiness.\n\nBroader economic impact\n\nThe total number of unfilled job openings rocketed from 7.2 million to 7.8 million in two months from January to March, Basu said.\n\n\u201cMy very strong sense is that that has a lot to do, not with just the strengthening economy, but rather employers increasingly seeking to replace undocumented workers with documented ones,\u201d he said. \u201cConstruction is one of the industries that has tended to utilize a significant fraction of undocumented worker capacity. That partial solution is now less accessible.\u201d\n\nFewer workers, or increased competition for a limited pool of workers, could lead to lengthened project timelines or even cancellations. Even current healthy backlog numbers could potentially be an indicator of a negative shift.\n\n\u201cI have a strong suspicion that the recent strength and backlog that has emerged among many contractors has a lot to do with the fact that it\u2019s taking them longer to complete projects,\u201d Basu said.\n\nTurmail said the worst case scenario would involve ICE detaining higher numbers of unauthorized workers without criminal records, \u201cwhich will probably lead to some construction projects getting halted because of lack of workers.\u201d\n\nThe road ahead\n\nIn contrast, Turmail said the best case scenario would simply be prolonged investment in workforce development for construction from multiple angles. That could include immigration reform.\n\n\u201cOur hope and what we\u2019re pushing for is that that\u2019s kind of where they pivot to,\u201d he said, adding that most legislators on Capitol Hill recognize the need for construction labor. \u201cLike Congress is eager to do something, but is kind of waiting for the Bat Signal from the president.\u201d\n\nCarrillo, too, has visited D.C. to pitch House members on methodology to turn unauthorized workers into documented citizens and create a better path for citizenship for tradesworkers and laborers.\n\nOn July 15, The Dignity Act of 2025, a bipartisan immigration bill, was introduced in the House. The law would update border security, overhaul the asylum program and make E-Verify mandatory for all U.S. employers, according to the National Immigration Forum.\n\nAdditionally, a program created by the Dignity Act would allow undocumented immigrants to earn legal status on the condition they pass a background check, pay any taxes owed and enroll in health coverage. The bill has only just been introduced, with no votes held yet.\n\nExperts told Construction Dive that because of its detrimental impact on the U.S. workforce, Trump\u2019s hardline anti-immigration policies may not last, as stakeholders continue to lobby the federal government to halt or change course.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to see in the quarters ahead,\u201d Basu said, indicating that prolonged economic impact may finally become clear in data around the midterm elections, which could potentially spur a pivot.\n\nBut, even if the policy softens, the damage to an industry in desperate need of workers may already be done.\n\n\u201cWith this immigration policy pushing back on immigration, whether undocumented or documented, that suggests given our nation\u2019s demographics, that if anything, the skilled worker shortage in construction is going to be exacerbated during the years ahead,\u201d Basu said.",

This follows \"unprecedented funding\" received by ICE on July 4, allowing for more resources. Contractors are now being warned to expect intensified activity, leading to worker absences and concerns even for compliant firms. This crackdown is beginning to affect large general contractors.\n\n**Why it matters:** Prolonged ICE crackdowns could extend project timelines for contractors of all sizes. This exacerbates the construction industry's already high demand for labor, as a partial solution via undocumented workers is now less accessible. Current healthy project backlog numbers may indicate longer completion times rather than just strong demand. This challenges the view that construction has a stable labor supply and could lead to project halts.\n\n**The big picture:** \"Uncertainty\" has been a key theme in the first half of the year regarding economic and political change. The Trump administration is now following through on previously uncertain anti-immigration rhetoric from the 2024 campaign. Unfilled job openings across industries surged from 7.2 million to 7.8 million in two months earlier this year. This rise is partly attributed to employers seeking to replace undocumented workers, impacting industries like construction.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   July 23: ICE agents raided an Alabama elementary school construction site.\n*   11 people: Arrested in the Alabama elementary school construction site raid.\n*   July 4: The \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" was signed into law, providing ICE with \"unprecedented funding.\"\n*   7.2 million to 7.8 million: Increase in unfilled job openings from January to March.\n*   July 15: The Dignity Act of 2025, a bipartisan immigration bill, was introduced in the House.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE): Agency increasing jobsite raids following \"unprecedented funding\" and administration directives.\n*   President Donald Trump: His administration is acting on anti-immigration rhetoric from the 2024 presidential campaign.\n*   Anirban Basu: Chief economist for Associated Builders and Contractors, noted increased clarity on serious deportation efforts.\n*   Associated General Contractors of America: Warned members of increased ICE activity following new agency funding.\n*   Brian Turmail: VP of public affairs for Associated General Contractors of America, discussed impacts and future scenarios.\n*   Todd Lyons: ICE Director, confirmed the agency received \"unprecedented funding\" on July 4.\n*   George Carrillo: Co-founder and CEO of Hispanic Construction Council, noted impacts on large general contractors.\n*   Hispanic Construction Council: Nonprofit seeking to advance policy goals for Hispanic construction workers and companies.\n*   National Immigration Forum: Provided details on The Dignity Act of 2025, a proposed bipartisan immigration bill.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Dignity Act of 2025, a bipartisan immigration bill, has been introduced in the House but no votes held yet.\n*   Data around the midterm elections in November 2026 could potentially spur a policy pivot.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** ICE crackdowns worsen construction labor shortages, threatening project timelines and backlogs.",

They require a lot of engagement, a lot of work, a lot of effort,\" said Daniel Maggin, associate dean of research, special education chair and professor of special education at the University of Illinois Chicago, during a session Wednesday.\n\nWhile the task to fill special education teaching vacancies is substantial, it's essential for supporting students with disabilities who need individualized academic and developmental supports, Maggin said.\n\nDistrict and state education systems should partner with universities to \"do the impossible, which is to develop more teachers, and develop more teachers who are of high quality,\" Maggin said.\n\nAccording to the Learning Policy Institute, 45 states reported special education teacher shortages in 2024-25 based on data reported to the Education Department. An LPI analysis shows that 48 states and the District of Columbia had 365,967 teachers who were not fully certified for their positions.\n\nTeacher preparation enrollment data is also discouraging for general and special education. Slightly more than half of states \u2014 27 \u2014 saw teacher preparation program enrollment declines of 5% or more between 2016-17 and 2020-21, according to LPI.\n\nSevere special educator teacher shortages in Illinois led the University of Illinois Chicago to develop two apprenticeship pathways for people to earn an educator license with a special education endorsement, said Maggin.\n\nThe first is for professionals \u2014 ideally with a bachelors degree \u2014 who want to earn their educator license, and the second, which is still in development, will be for those seeking both a degree and license. Developers hope to include high school students interested in the teaching profession in the second pathway.\n\nUnder both pathways, participants will receive coursework, fieldwork, student teaching experiences and mentoring specific to special education, said Chrissy Brown, a clinical assistant professor of special education at the University of Chicago Illinois.\n\nAspiring teachers can earn money by learning through on the job training, Brown said.\n\nFunding teacher preparation programs\n\nIncreasing access to early intervention, special education teaching and related services preparation programs is a goal of The DREAM Center, an OSEP-funded technical assistance center. The center \u2014 which stands for Delivering Resources, Education, and Access to Minority serving institutions \u2014 supports historically black colleges and universities, tribally controlled colleges and universities, and other minority serving institutions in seeking grants to help prepare special education professionals.\n\nThe center is a collaboration between Florida International University, Bowie State University and United Tribes Technical College.\n\nChauntea Cummings, assistant director of the center, said during a Tuesday session that there's a need to build the special education teacher pipeline from underrepresented communities. Nearly 80% of special education teachers in 2022 were White, despite an overall student population that is currently about 53% non-White, Cummings said.\n\nMinority serving institutions, while representing 21% of all educator preparation providers, struggle with developing and submitting grants to support educator preparation programs, she said. The challenges include lack of support for grant writing and lack of resources for course design and training for faculty.\n\n\"We'd love to have many, many scholars, but we have to do what to get them there? Support them financially,\" Cummings said. To best assist the colleges, the center has a tiered system of supports that includes intensive individualized assistance for institutions in need, she said.\n\nMaria Silva, project coordinator at the center, said at the same session that grant assistance for minority serving institutions involves mentorship from those who have experience in applying, securing and implementing grants.\n\nMentors, \"still have that passion, and they want to share that passion with other faculty members to continue this\" and expand minority serving institutions' financial opportunities, Silva said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nQuantum physics education at the high school level is often limited, if offered at all. To bridge this knowledge gap, a program in Texas has made quality quantum physics instruction more accessible to students and educators alike.\n\nQuantum for All is a national pilot led by the University of Texas at Arlington. It wrapped up its fifth annual camp in June, welcoming new and returning students and educators to learn and explore hands-on quantum physics.\n\nWhile the program has far exceeded expectations according to its principal investigator, its future is uncertain since the nearly $1 million National Science Foundation grant that funded it ended this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAccording to physics educators, learning about quantum physics exposes students to careers and fields they might not have otherwise considered and also helps them develop critical thinking skills they can apply beyond the classroom.\n\n\u201cIt's really important for our youth to have an appreciation for science, specifically quantum, and how it is applicable in their lives, how they can use it in the workforce, and what jobs they can get from it,\u201d said Karen Matsler, Quantum for All principal investigator and a professor at UT Arlington. \u201cWe need to stay ahead of the pack when it comes to other countries and technology and security. We don't have a choice, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe Quantum for All summer program serves around 40 teachers and 40 to 60 students in a typical year. Most of the students are in grades 9-10, and the teachers come not only from physics but other disciplines as well.\n\nThe first week of the two-week program is dedicated to professional learning, where teachers work through the quantum physics concepts and projects they will be teaching students the following week.\n\nStudents join the camp during the second week and educators work in small groups to co-present lessons. This helps split the workload and makes it less intimidating, Matsler explained. They're learning through watching other teachers and by watching the kids, she said.\n\nBecause of the prominence of quantum across several fields, teachers from different backgrounds such as art and math are encouraged to participate.\n\n\u201cThe program gave me the opportunity to try these lessons in a low-risk environment, and also gave me hands-on lessons that weren't just math driven,\u201d said Meghan DiBacco, an Advanced Placement physics teacher at Jordan High School in Texas. DiBacco added that the program helped her become a leader in her classroom.\n\nTo be mindful of educators' already heavy workload, Matsler focused on incorporating quantum physics education into curriculum areas that teachers are already covering. That way the professional learning helps them modify what they\u2019re doing \u2014 not add to it.\n\nThe program\u2019s format of professional learning followed by direct practice is what sets it apart from other professional learning resources, said Jaime Govea, the physics lead at Mesquite High School. Govea, who is participating in the program for a second year, said it provides a much needed resource for educators like him who otherwise had little guidance on how to meet state standards for science.\n\n\u201cI think what Dr. Matsler\u2019s program has done is fill in the gaps that the state has left behind,\u201d said Govea.\n\nThe program doesn't just forge confident teachers but also confident students, points out Robin Griffith-Yates, associate principal of the STEM Academy at Arlington\u2019s James Martin High School, which hosted the camp. Her favorite part of the program, she said, is the open house on the last day where parents see the projects students have been working on.\n\nGriffith-Yates said students are as excited to share what they\u2019ve learned with their parents as their parents are to get a glimpse of what their child has been working on. She noted that students become more confident in their knowledge and can easily explain topics in quantum that had intimidated them at the beginning of the week.\n\n\u201cIn order to teach something like this, bringing it to something that students use every day and are familiar with, I think, really does help to build that confidence and build that knowledge so that they are willing to try it and talk about it,\u201d said Griffith-Yates.\n\nMatsler said she and her team will start looking for private and philanthropic funders in hopes to continue the program next summer.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe books taught in secondary classrooms have largely not changed over the last 35 years , according to a new report from the National Council of Teachers of English.\n\nEven in the face of classroom censorship and uneven teacher autonomy and curriculum flexibility, the diversity of books taught has changed little since 1989, the study found, based on responses from 4,096 current secondary English language arts teachers in public schools.\n\nPrior to the NCTE study, there were only two other large-scale national studies of literature used in secondary English classrooms, in 1964 and 1989. The current researchers found a greater difference in the books on the top 10 list from 1964 to 1989 than they did between 1989 and 2024.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAccording to the NCTE study, 90% of teachers somewhat or strongly agreed that diverse literature should be required for all students.\n\nDiversity in literature matters because it makes reading more engaging and exposes students to realities beyond their own, said NCTE President Tonya Perry. Having diverse books in the classroom allows students to relate to what they read and puts some of the timeless themes of the classics into a more modern context, she said.\n\n\u201cIf your books don't reflect diversity in experiences, and you don't have a chance to think more about today's world, then it doesn't challenge you to bring yourself to the table and think more about how you can impact your own world and other spaces,\u201d said Perry.\n\nOf the books on the top 10 list for 2024, these were also on the 1989 top 10:, \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cOf Mice and Men,\u201d \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d and \u201cHamlet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMacbeth\u201d appeared across all three lists.\n\nThe authors on the 1964 list were all White and all men except for Mary Ann Evans, who used the pen name George Eliot to hide her gender, the NCTE report noted. The 1989 list of books also came from White male authors aside from one White woman, Harper Lee. The 2024 list included one other woman author, Mary Shelley.\n\n\u201cI don't think that having texts that are older is something that we can't have in our classroom, but I do believe that having diverse texts in the classroom actually enhances our instruction,\u201d said Perry. \u201cEven if we have texts that are listed here, they could be paired with more modern texts to really bring students in, to get that kind of thinking that we want from our students.\u201d\n\nWhile the classics remain in the top 10 of most-taught books, 93% of teachers reported using diverse literature in their classrooms, and 91% said they wanted to use more diverse literature.\n\nAccording to the NCTE report, various factors could contribute to the enduring prominence of classic texts in secondary English language arts classrooms. For one, while teachers are reportedly using diverse, contemporary literature, the sheer range of options can lead to those titles appearing on the top 10 list less frequently.\n\nThe level of autonomy teachers have over their curriculum can also impact the diversity in their curriculum. About 1 in 5 teachers reported having no autonomy in their text selection, while another 1 in 5 said they had complete autonomy.\n\nThe report also noted that censorship is having an effect. Teachers mentioned 1,359 unique titles that their schools, districts or libraries have censored.\n\n\u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\" is the only book that appeared on both the top 10 censored and top 10 taught books \u2014 it was the second most censored book but also the sixth most taught. Eight of the remaining nine books on the top 10 most frequently taught list also appeared in the censored book list.\n\nAccording to the survey, the four most mentioned sources of censorship were: parents, school boards, state law and the school district. Parents are a particularly influential part of the censorship process, the report said, as they were mentioned more than twice as often as state laws or school districts.\n\nAs educators grapple with being equipped to teach diverse texts and also deal with potential pushback, Perry emphasized the importance of continuous professional development opportunities.\n\nShe explained that professional development should prepare teachers to provide explanations and rationales to parents about why they are teaching specific books. Professional training should also help educators become more comfortable in teaching and advocating for diverse literature through conversations with other teachers.",

The last time such a case came before the Supreme Court was 1980\u2019s Stone v. Graham, in which the justices wrote in an unsigned ruling that a Kentucky statute \u2014 similar to the current Louisiana law \u2014 violated the establishment clause.\n\nIn more recent cases, however, the majority of the Supreme Court has been more sympathetic toward religion in public schools.\n\nIn 2022, for example, the Supreme Court ruled in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District that a Washington school district violated a football coach\u2019s First Amendment rights when it fired him for praying on the 50-yard line \u2014 at times including students \u2014 after his team\u2019s games.\n\nBut Brooks\u2019 order temporarily blocking the Arkansas law on Monday referred to Supreme Court decisions on religion in schools including Kennedy, saying that case \u201cdoes not alter the reasoning and outcome of Stone.\u201d In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court \u201cexplicitly acknowledged that state-mandated religious displays and practices in the public-school setting are subject to special treatment because public-school children are a captive audience.\u201d\n\nMore Republican-leaning states are also testing the boundaries of religion in schools through a growing number of likeminded bills, including Oklahoma, Utah, South Carolina, and North Dakota.\n\nLouisiana became the first state to enact a law requiring schools to display the religious directives in 2024. In June, however, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Rev. Roake v. Brumley that the state\u2019s mandate for Louisiana classrooms was unconstitutional.\n\nShortly after Texas enacted its own Ten Commandments requirements for schools in June, a lawsuit challenging the edict was filed in July by a group of 16 multi-faith and nonreligious families in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs are also seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the state from implementing the law as the case moves through the courts, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs alongside the ACLU of Texas, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.\n\nIn his Monday order on Arkansas\u2019 mandate, Brooks questioned the motives behind the recent wave of Ten Commandments laws in states nationwide, calling the state \"part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\"\n\n\u201cThese states view the past decade of rulings by the Supreme Court on religious displays in public spaces as a signal that the Court would be open to revisiting its precedent on religious displays in the public-school context,\u201d Brooks wrote.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 The U.S. Department of Education is working with school districts and states to expand school choice models for students with disabilities that will spur innovative and effective learning opportunities, a top federal special education official said during opening remarks Tuesday at the Office of Special Education Programs' annual conference.\n\n\"Our goal is to expand choices for students with special needs so that every family has options to find the best-fit school for their child and not have it be the other way around, where they have to force their child to be a fit in a school that may not be for them,\" Diana Diaz-Harrison, deputy assistant secretary of the department's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, told the 1,200 conference attendees.\n\nAt the same time the Education Department is striving to expand choice options beyond the traditional public school, Diaz-Harrison said, it will be honoring the nearly 50-year-old Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that guarantees educational rights to students with disabilities.\n\nIDEA, originally called the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, was signed into law on Nov. 29, 1975. Nearly 8 million students ages 3-21 were eligible for IDEA services in the fall of 2023. Some 462,847 young children ages 0-2 received IDEA services.\n\nAs a \"landmark civil rights law,\" Diaz-Harrison said, IDEA \"has transformed education and created so many opportunities for our most vulnerable children.\"\n\nShe asked education leaders across the nation \"to implement IDEA with innovation in mind\" and to \"uphold civil rights while embracing 21st century tools.\"\n\nIDEA practices must evolve, she said. \"Families are seeking choices, flexibility, innovation, high quality and specialization. The promise of IDEA must adapt to the current landscape of education options and to new options.\"\n\nThis includes giving states and districts more decision-making power and flexibility, Diaz-Harrison said.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Education Department's role is being shrunk. In the past few months, the department has slimmed its staff by half through layoffs and other moves. However, no OSEP employees were let go during a massive March 11 reduction in force, according to an April 28 letter from the Education Department to Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del.\n\nU.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon and President Donald Trump, however, want to move special education oversight out of the Education Department to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. No formal plan for that transition has yet been made public, but more than a dozen former federal special education leaders in July wrote to congressional leaders imploring them to reject such a change.\n\nPublic school advocates have pushed back on federal and state efforts to increase private school choice options, saying public schools would lose money and resources if taxpayer-supported funding is shared with private schools. They also worry about equitable access to high-quality education programs and accountability for private schools.\n\nAdditionally, school choice opponents point out that private schools can choose which students to enroll while public schools must educate all students, including those with disabilities. Private schools do not have to comply with IDEA.\n\nIn July, Congress passed the massive tax and spending \"big, beautiful\" bill with a provision to create a nationwide federally funded private school choice program. The new school choice tax incentive will generate funds for private school choice, homeschooling expenses and public and private school costs for education, such as tutoring, technology and transportation. States will need to opt into the program.\n\nDiaz-Harrison said her own struggles to find a right-fit school for her son with autism inspired her to found the Arizona Autism Charter Schools. Opened in 2014, the network now has five schools with more planned, she said.\n\n\"The power of IDEA was the foundation for our schools,\" Diaz-Harrison said. \"I knew that every student needed an individual education plan, because, as they say, when you meet one child with special needs, you met one child, and what every child needs is uniquely different.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Education Department Pushes School Choice for Students with Disabilities\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. Department of Education aims to expand school choice models for students with disabilities to help families find \"best-fit\" schools. This expansion will honor the nearly 50-year-old Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) while evolving its practices to include more state and district flexibility. A new federal tax bill includes a nationwide federally funded private school choice program, which states must opt into. The Education Department has reduced its staff by half and faces proposals to move special education oversight to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis initiative could fundamentally alter the delivery and funding of special education services. It challenges the traditional model by shifting resources and decision-making power towards expanded choices, including private options. The new federal funding for private choice programs challenges the current consensus of primary reliance on public schools for all students, as public school advocates worry about losing money and resources. Proposals to move special education oversight to HHS also suggest a potential reshaping of federal oversight.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), signed in 1975, is a \"landmark civil rights law\" guaranteeing educational rights for students with disabilities, serving millions. Families are increasingly seeking choices, flexibility, innovation, high quality, and specialization in education for their children. The Trump administration has been shrinking the Education Department's role and staff. This expansion of choice occurs amid pushback from public school advocates concerned about funding and equitable access if taxpayer money is shared with private schools.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   IDEA signed into law: Nov. 29, 1975\n*   Students eligible for IDEA services (Fall 2023): Nearly 8 million (ages 3-21)\n*   Young children receiving IDEA services: 462,847 (ages 0-2)\n*   Office of Special Education Programs conference attendees: 1,200\n*   Education Department staff reduction: Half\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Department of Education:** Working to expand school choice models for students with disabilities.\n*   **Diana Diaz-Harrison:** Deputy Assistant Secretary advocating for expanded special education choice and IDEA evolution.\n*   **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA):** Landmark civil rights law guaranteeing educational rights to students with disabilities.\n*   **Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester:** D-Del. Senator who received a letter about Education Department staff reductions.\n*   **Linda McMahon:** U.S. Education Secretary who wants to move special education oversight to HHS.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Wants to move special education oversight out of the Education Department.\n*   **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:** Proposed new department to oversee special education.\n*   **Congress:** Passed a tax and spending bill with a nationwide private school choice program provision.\n*   **Arizona Autism Charter Schools:** Network of five schools founded by Diaz-Harrison, inspired by her son.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Formal plan for special education oversight transition to HHS has not yet been made public.\n*   States will need to opt into the new nationwide federally funded private school choice program.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFederal push for special education choice reshapes traditional educational models.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Houston Independent School District, two years post-state takeover, had zero failing schools as of the 2024-25 school year, according to preliminary results released Tuesday.\n\nTexas\u2019 largest school district also more than doubled the number of schools earning an A or B rating, from 93 two years ago to 197 last school year \u2014 meaning almost three quarters of its 273 schools are now in those top tiers.\n\nThe improvements are especially concentrated among previously underperforming schools in historically underserved areas that enroll primarily low-income, Black and brown families, according to Houston ISD Superintendent Mike Miles. This means achievement gaps in the district are closing, Miles said.\n\n\"It makes the point that ZIP code doesn't have to be destiny,\" said Miles. \"It can be done if there's the will to do it.\"\n\nThe state takeover of Houston ISD, which was surrounded by controversy and resistance, is one of the most watched takeovers in the nation because of its large scale.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of school ratings from before and after Houston ISD's takeover shows significant improvements in the number of schools rated A or B. Permission granted by Houston Independent School District\n\nAfter Miles took the reins in the summer of 2023, the district designated about a third of its schools as \u201cNew Education Schools\u201d and targeted for wholesale, systemic reform rather than incremental changes sometimes seen in other state takeovers. The number of NES schools was expanded to 130 total by 2024-25.\n\n'That is doable in any district'\n\nHouston's improvements come as more districts nationwide are facing financial hardships, decreasing enrollments and possible state intervention.\n\nHouston's takeover, for example, was launched after the district invested its pandemic relief dollars in recurring expenses, which district finance experts had warned against given the likelihood of fiscal cliffs as federal aid dollars ended and districts' budget cuts ensued.\n\nMiles said the district is working toward systemic reform without any additional funding \u2014 and with a budget deficit, meaning it had to reprioritize before seeing gains. \"Every large urban or medium-sized urban district has the money to do what they prioritize,\" said Miles.\n\nFor districts seeking turnaround, Miles suggests prioritizing funding to boost the quality of instruction and school building leadership, including by:\n\nHaving the most effective teachers teach the lowest-performing kids.\n\nDeveloping teacher capacity and making sure principals are instructional leaders.\n\nCoaching principals to be able to coach teachers.\n\nHaving instructional executive directors who can train principals under their charge.\n\nHaving high-quality instruction that guides high-quality curriculum rather than the other way around.\n\n\"And so all of that is doable in any district, and it doesn't have to take that much money,\" said Miles. The biggest expense, he said, is for teacher salaries \u2014 which Houston ISD has in fact raised \u2014 and for teacher apprentices.\n\nThe exit plan\n\nAlthough Houston has shown success since its takeover, the district still has 18 D-rated schools. And the Texas Education Agency, which is expected to release the district's formal results on Aug. 15, announced in June that the takeover would be extended by two years.\n\nThe extension, Miles said, is partly to help ensure that the districtwide reforms don't revert after the state hands over leadership to an elected board, as has happened in other districts.\n\n\"It's like losing weight. Say you have to lose 40 pounds \u2014 the first 30 is probably easier than the last 10 to lose,\" said Miles. \"It's still hard work, you know, and we have to stay where we are.\"\n\nHowever, where Miles was previously uncomfortable calling Houston's improvement a \"trend,\" he acknowledged on Tuesday with the release of the preliminary results showing the district's performance is trending upward.\n\nNot only has the district improved its performance on state assessments, but it has also shown gains on other tests like the National Assessment of Educational Progress, NWEA MAP Growth, and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills.\n\n\"We feel confident that the data are accurate and really do tell the story of a Houston turnaround,\" Miles said.",

Between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, 40% of private schools reported an enrollment increase, the study found.\n\nSome 32% of private schools saw enrollment decrease and 28% reported no change, the Cato Institute said. Among schools with rising enrollment, 69% attribute the growth to \u201ca values alignment between the school and parents.\u201d Other top reasons cited include a better academic experience (44%) and parents\u2019 religious beliefs (43%).\n\nThough private schools have reported steady enrollment increases since the pandemic, the momentum appears to be slowing down, Cato said. The proportion of schools most recently reporting growth dropped by 15 percentage points from a peak of 55% between the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe slowing growth in private school enrollment over the past four years indicates the \u201cCOVID-19 increase is almost over\u201d or that other factors \u201cdriving net private school enrollment increases are waning,\u201d according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank and research organization.\n\nAt the same time, enrollment has still continued to rise, fueled by \u201cdisputes over values\u201d such as gender identity, religion or access to books touching on sex, race or American history, said the Cato Institute. A combination of pandemic frustrations and conflicts over certain values in public schools seem to be driving a surge in school choice programs, which could also be spurring be private school enrollment, the report added.\n\nPrivate schools that reported a decrease in enrollment between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years were most likely to attribute the dip to financial issues (48%), competition (47%) and family demographics (29%).\n\nPrivate schools in the South saw the largest average enrollment increase, followed by those in the Midwest and then the West, the report found. The Northeast was the only region to show decreased average enrollment.\n\nOver 880 private schools responded to the Cato Institute's survey conducted between October and November 2024. About a third of the responding schools were nonsectarian, with the remaining having religious affiliations.\n\nAnother recent study points to a lingering negative impact from the pandemic on public school enrollment.\n\nEducation Next, in analyzing K-12 enrollment in Massachusetts, found sustained shifts from public schools to nonpublic alternatives in the past five years. The state\u2019s enrollment fell by 4.2% at public schools and 2.6% at private schools, while homeschooling jumped 51%. Though private school enrollment dropped, it still performed much better than researchers expected as they initially predicted a 16% drop in that time frame.\n\nThe Education Next researchers also wrote that their findings in Massachusetts could reflect a broader pattern given the state\u2019s 2024 data closely resembles national enrollment trends from 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, as researchers examine the lasting impacts from COVID, a new federal private school choice program is likely to add mounting pressure on the traditional public school model, which relies on student enrollment for funding. On top of that, states are increasingly offering their own universal private school choice programs.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMost clicked story of the week:\n\nA recent \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter sent to district and state leaders from the U.S. Department of Education provided guidance on using existing federal grants to integrate artificial intelligence in schools.\n\nThe letter, signed by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, said grantees may use federal funds to implement AI to enhance high-quality curriculum tools, high-impact tutoring, and college and career pathway advising. The department also outlined its principles for responsible AI use in schools, affirming that initiatives should be educator-led, ethical, accessible for those with disabilities, transparent in the way new tools are rolled out, and in compliance with federal data privacy laws.\n\nNumber of the week: $79 billion The proposed funding level for the Education Department in fiscal year 2026 by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee. The bipartisan proposal, approved in a 26-3 vote on Thursday, would prevent the executive branch from removing Title I and special education programs to agencies outside the Education Department. The bill also rejects several other funding reforms proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe still-shifting policy landscape for schools:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice released sweeping guidance Wednesday that limits the use of \u201cunlawful\u201d DEI practices in school district hiring and training practices, as well as the programming available to students. For example, districts could be exposed to legal liability by asking job applicants how their \u201ccultural background informs their teaching,\u201d using recruitment strategies targeting candidates from specific geographic areas or racial backgrounds, and asking job candidates to describe how they overcame obstacles, according to the memo from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday encouraged states to seek waivers from the requirements of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which it said can be \u201cburdensome.\u201d Waivers, the department said, would allow state leaders to spend money \u201dfree from bureaucratic red tape.\u201d Passed in 1965, ESEA is meant to address educational inequities and improve educational quality by holding states accountable to certain regulations and requirements.\n\nA new federal private school choice program approved in the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill\u201d is adding to existing pressure for public schools from state-led private school choice programs, shrinking enrollment and an array of funding concerns. According to FutureEd, the number of students using universal private school choice options ballooned 40% in just one year \u2014 from 584,000 students to 805,000 between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years. That\u2019s also up from just 64,022 students participating in 2022-23. We took an in-depth look at what a national private school choice program could mean for public schools .\n\nSchool operations in the spotlight:",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Federal Policy Shifts, Funding, and Private School Growth Reshape Education Landscape\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. Department of Education issued guidance allowing federal grants for integrating artificial intelligence in schools, including for curriculum tools and tutoring. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of Justice released sweeping guidance limiting certain \"unlawful\" DEI practices in school district hiring, training, and student programming. The Education Department also encouraged states to seek waivers from the \"burdensome\" requirements of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Furthermore, a new federal private school choice program, alongside existing state options, is significantly increasing pressure on public schools.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese federal actions create a complex, evolving landscape for education-focused investors. The guidance on AI integration signals a potential new market for technology providers, albeit within defined ethical and privacy boundaries. Restrictions on DEI practices could alter how districts allocate spending on related services and training. The push for ESEA waivers might provide states with greater funding flexibility, potentially changing procurement priorities for education service providers. Critically, the surging growth in private school choice programs directly pressures public school funding and enrollment, challenging the long-held view of a stable, public-school-dominated market and suggesting new growth opportunities in private education.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe broader context is a dynamic federal policy environment significantly impacting the education sector. Various U.S. government entities, including the Departments of Education and Justice, are issuing new guidance and proposals affecting how schools operate, fund programs, and hire staff. This includes ongoing legislative debates over federal funding levels and the rejection of certain funding reforms by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee. Concurrently, public schools face increasing competitive pressure and funding concerns due to a rapid expansion of private school choice programs nationwide.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$79 billion:** Proposed funding level for the Education Department in fiscal year 2026 by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.\n*   **26-3:** Vote count approving the bipartisan funding proposal in the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n*   **40%:** Increase in students utilizing universal private school choice options in one year.\n*   **584,000 to 805,000:** Students using universal private school choice options between 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years.\n*   **64,022:** Students participating in private school choice in 2022-23.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Department of Education:** Issued AI guidance and encouraged ESEA waivers for states.\n*   **Linda McMahon:** Education Secretary who signed guidance on federal AI grant usage.\n*   **U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee:** Approved proposed $79 billion funding for the Education Department.\n*   **Trump administration:** Proposed Education Department funding reforms that were rejected.\n*   **U.S. Department of Justice:** Issued guidance limiting \"unlawful\" DEI practices in school districts.\n*   **Pamela Bondi:** U.S. Attorney General who issued memo on school DEI practices.\n*   **FutureEd:** Provided data on significant increase in private school choice students.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFederal policy and funding shifts, alongside private school growth, are reshaping the education market.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSchool districts likely won't see a significant increase in lawsuits in the long term in the aftermath of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June that endorsed a lower burden of proof for claims of disability discrimination against school systems, legal experts say.\n\n\"For school districts, frankly, I think the general impression people have is going to be overblown,\" said Perry Zirkel, an expert in special education law. \"I don't see it having a major long-range effect for school district people or for parents.\"\n\nBut Zirkel and other education attorneys say school districts need to take several steps to ensure they don't become vulnerable to civil rights claims for monetary damages related to supports and services for students with disabilities. That includes preventing discriminatory practices through training sessions about disability-related policies and practices, as well as addressing problems as soon as they are known.\n\nFirst, school leaders should anticipate problematic situations and work to avoid those, said Jose Mart\u00edn, an attorney with Richards, Lindsay & Mart\u00edn in Austin, Texas, which represents school districts. Then, \"if some problem happens and staff persons act inappropriately, you respond.\"\n\nA high bar\n\nThe unanimous Supreme Court ruling in A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schools in June clarified that the \"deliberate indifference\" standard applied to education disability discrimination cases should apply universally, replacing the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' higher standard of \"bad faith or gross misjudgment,\" said Mart\u00edn.\n\nThe case centered on a Minnesota student with epilepsy whose request for classes that started later in the school day and went into the evening hours was rejected by Osseo Area Schools. The student and her family filed a complaint under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act claiming a denial of a free, appropriate public education.\n\nAn administrative law judge found that the district had violated IDEA and awarded additional services to the student. A federal district court also ruled in the student's favor.\n\nThe student and family then sued the school district under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, seeking to permanently secure the student's right to a full school day on the amended schedule, as well as \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d The same federal district court ruled against the student and in favor of the school district, saying the district\u2019s actions didn\u2019t meet the bad faith and gross misjudgment standard. The 8th Circuit upheld that ruling.\n\n\"A good legal question for people like me is, \u2018What's the difference between a serious IDEA violation and deliberate indifference?\u2019 Well, definitely, deliberate indifference is worse. It's higher, and you knew you were screwing up, and you didn't fix it.\" Jose Mart\u00edn Attorney with Richards, Lindsay & Mart\u00edn\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court ruling, students and families making education discrimination claims through ADA and Section 504 in states under the jurisdiction of the 8th Circuit and four additional appellate circuits that used the higher standard had to prove that schools acted in bad faith or gross misjudgment.\n\nStudents and families in the jurisdictions of other circuit courts and others outside education settings who claimed disability discrimination under ADA and Section 504 and were seeking monetary damages, had to only show that a school, workplace or other entity acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d\n\nThe high court ruling defined deliberate indifference as requiring a plaintiff to prove that \u201cthe defendant disregarded a \u2018strong likelihood\u2019 that the challenged action would \u2018result in a violation of federally protected rights.\u2019\u201d\n\nDisability rights advocates celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling at the time, calling it a victory.\n\n\"Students with disabilities and their families bringing civil rights claims against their school districts for disability discrimination will no longer have to meet the uniquely high and burdensome standard of proving that school officials acted with bad faith or gross misjudgment,\" said Selene Almazan, legal director at the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, in a July 28 email.\n\nCOPAA, which supports the legal rights of students with disabilities, had filed an amicus brief in A.J.T. v. Osseo siding with the family plaintiffs.\n\nZirkel and Mart\u00edn say the deliberate indifference standard is also hard to meet.\n\n\n\nMart\u00edn said he views the deliberate indifference standard as having to show that a school system intentionally discriminated against a student by having a \"completely unreasonable response to the problem, or an utter disregard.\"\n\n\"I like to explain it [deliberate indifference] to people by saying, 'There's a big legal problem over here, and a kid is getting damaged, and the way that I'm going to handle it is by looking the other way,'\" Mart\u00edn said.\n\nHe adds, \"A good legal question for people like me is, \u2018What's the difference between a serious IDEA violation and deliberate indifference?\u2019 Well, definitely, deliberate indifference is worse. It's higher, and you knew you were screwing up, and you didn't fix it,\" Mart\u00edn said.\n\nZirkel noted that parent plaintiffs have not prevailed in a majority of the court decisions under the deliberate indifference standard. \"The odds are still against parents who bring those kinds of cases for money damages,\" Zirkel said.\n\nZirkel and Mart\u00edn both predict that school systems may initially see an uptick in disability discrimination claims as parents test the waters under the recent Supreme Court decision.\n\nSome people might have the impression that the removal of the bad faith and gross misjudgment standard \"will open the floodgates\" of litigation against districts, Zirkel said. \"But it won't open the floodgates, because all you'll have is a different bar or standard or control for the floodgate, which is still quite high.\"\n\nJulie Weatherly, founder of Resolutions in Special Education, a consulting and legal services firm that advises school districts and other agencies on educating students with disabilities, said she's received many inquiries from school leaders wondering if the A.J.T. v Osseo decision means they will need to comply with every accommodation a student or parent seeks.\n\nShe hesitated to predict the future regarding the impact the ruling will have on litigation against districts nationwide. But she did point out that the Supreme Court had ruled on a narrow and specific question and did not award monetary damages to the plaintiffs or rule that the plaintiffs proved the school district violated Section 504.\n\n\"The court did not say it's now easier for parents to sue school districts or recover money damages for violations of the IDEA by using 504 as a gateway to litigation,\" Weatherly said.\n\n\"A lot is unsettled\" regarding the interaction between IDEA and Section 504 when it comes to schools providing supports and services for students with disabilities, she added.\n\nAn awareness of Section 504\n\nWhen there's a dispute under IDEA for special education students, prevailing parties can receive awards for attorneys' fees, and school systems can promise to compensate students and families by providing additional services or even private school tuition.\n\nBut victories in IDEA claims do not provide monetary damages. Prevailing claims under ADA and Section 504 can, however.\n\nThat's why the A.J.T. v Osseo case was closely watched by school officials and attorneys. Section 504 and ADA claims can be filed by families of IDEA-eligible students and non-IDEA students, including those who only have a Section 504 plan. Zirkel said leading examples of disability discrimination claims brought by Section 504-only students for money damages involve bullying, suicide and physical abuse by staff members.\n\nAbout 14% of K-12 students nationwide qualified for IDEA services in the 2020-21 school year, according to the most recent Civil Rights Data Collection. To qualify for IDEA services, a student needs to have a disability, and that disability must be limiting the student from making educational progress.\n\nAnother 3% were served under Section 504 only, the CRDC found. Section 504-only students have a disability that may require accommodations, such as extended time on tests or supports for managing diabetes.\n\nSome students can qualify for both IDEA and Section 504 services.\n\n\"Students with disabilities and their families bringing civil rights claims against their school districts for disability discrimination will no longer have to meet the uniquely high and burdensome standard of proving that school officials acted with bad faith or gross misjudgment.\" Selene Almazan Legal director at the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates\n\nResearch by Zirkel and Gina Gullo, assistant director of educational services at the Pennsylvania State Education Association, published in the Education Law Reporter in July 2025, shows the state-level percentages of Section 504-only students continuing to climb between 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. States that had the highest percentages of Section 504-only students in 2021-22 include New Hampshire (7.8%), Texas (7.6%), and Connecticut (7%), according to the latest available data from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nDistrict-level data from 2021-22 analyzed by Zirkel and scheduled for publication in Education Law Reporter in August shows pockets of high rates of Section 504-only students, such as in Texas' Pottsboro Independent School District (17.4%), Texas' Gatesville Independent School District (16.9%), and Connecticut's Westport School District (16.8%).\n\nThose districts and states with high percentages of Section 504-only students may be more susceptible to disability discrimination claims, Zirkel said.\n\nMart\u00edn says it's important that school systems conduct trainings about Section 504 awareness and implementation. These trainings and resources are especially critical now as school systems struggle with shortages of special educators, related service providers, counselors and psychologists, he said.\n\nBut Mart\u00edn, who conducts professional development sessions on Section 504 for education administrators, said he has not altered his trainings in response to A.J.T. v Osseo.\n\n\"This idea that this is going to expand money damages claims in federal court against schools for educational harms \u2014 I don't see it.\u201d",

Osseo Area Schools clarified that the \"deliberate indifference\" standard applies universally to education disability discrimination cases. This decision replaced a higher \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard previously used by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and four other appellate circuits. This change means students and families seeking monetary damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 540 of the Rehabilitation Act now face a single, albeit still high, legal threshold.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhile disability rights advocates celebrated the ruling as a victory for students, legal experts predict it will not \"open the floodgates\" of litigation against school districts. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard, defined as disregarding a \"strong likelihood\" of violating federally protected rights, remains difficult to meet, with parent plaintiffs not prevailing in a majority of past cases. This challenges a potential consensus view that the lowered burden of proof would lead to a significant surge in successful claims for monetary damages, impacting school district finances. Schools are advised to prevent discriminatory practices through training and prompt problem resolution.\n\n**The big picture:**\nHistorically, claims under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) did not provide monetary damages, only additional services or tuition. However, successful claims under ADA and Section 504 can result in monetary damages, making the standard of proof critical. The A.J.T. v. Osseo case involved a Minnesota student seeking an amended schedule, who ultimately sued for compensatory damages under ADA and Section 504 after winning additional services under IDEA. The Supreme Court ruling aimed to unify the standard for such claims across different appellate circuits.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **14%**: K-12 students nationwide who qualified for IDEA services in the 2020-21 school year.\n*   **3%**: K-12 students served under Section 504 only in the 2020-21 school year.\n*   **7.8%**: New Hampshire's percentage of Section 504-only students in 2021-22, highest among states.\n*   **17.4%**: Texas' Pottsboro Independent School District's Section 504-only student rate in 2021-22, highest among mentioned districts.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Perry Zirkel:** Special education law expert, believes ruling's long-term effect on school districts will be \"overblown.\"\n*   **Jose Mart\u00edn:** Attorney with Richards, Lindsay & Mart\u00edn, advises school districts on preventing civil rights claims.\n*   **Osseo Area Schools:** School district involved in the Supreme Court case A.J.T. v.

The group of Democratic officials said it believed it was \u201ccritical to rebut [the prior letter\u2019s] assertions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the SEC and DOL to uphold their commitment to protecting the ability of fiduciaries to exercise their professional judgment in assessing long-term financial risks,\u201d the Feb. 19 letter said. \u201cEfforts to politicize investment management and restrict fiduciary discretion threaten the financial security of millions of retirees.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Democratic finance officials took particular issue with the Republican officials\u2019 letter relying heavily on a federal judge\u2019s ruling against American Airlines in a lawsuit over the management of its retirement plans. The Republican finance officials used U.S. District Court judge Reed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling as evidence that the incorporation of factors like ESG is being used to pursue non-pecuniary goals.\n\nThe officials included state auditors, treasurers, controllers and comptrollers from New York City, California, Illinois and 12 other states who said that such a characterization of the use of environmental, social and governance factors is \u201cincorrect and dangerously misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision in Spence v. American Airlines, which dismissed long-term financial interests as a \u2018mere pretext,\u2019 fails to reflect the fundamental reality of long-term investing,\u201d the Democratic officials wrote. \u201cFiduciaries are not speculators \u2014 they are stewards of trillions of dollars in assets that must sustain retirees for decades.\u201d\n\nOfficials from Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also signed onto the letter. They said that risks related to climate change, governance failures and systemic issues are \u201cpresent-day financial realities affecting market valuations, insurance costs, supply chains and infrastructure resilience.\"\n\nThe Republican officials had said in their Jan. 28 letter that they held \u201cserious concerns\u201d that funds were being used to advance ESG or DEI goals and asked for rulemaking to prohibit plans from using assets to \u201cadvance political or social goals.\u201d They also asked the Labor Department and SEC to issue comprehensive guidance explicitly saying that making investment decisions or proxy votes based on ESG or diversity, equity and inclusion objectives is \u201cinconsistent with fiduciary duties.\u201d\n\nConnecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell called the request a \u201cdangerous political proposal\u201d in emailed comments to ESG Dive Wednesday, while Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs went a step further, calling the approach \u201cOrwellian\u201d and \u201ca reckless attempt to put politics ahead of sound financial decision-making\u201d in comments Wednesday.\n\n\u201cForbidding investment managers from assessing real-world risks \u2014 whether they stem from supply chain disruptions, environmental instability, shifting consumer demand, or any other factor \u2014 would restrict their ability to fully analyze investment opportunities and inherently runs counter to that fiduciary responsibility,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe blue state fiduciaries warned that if utilizing ESG factors in investment decisions was banned for fiduciaries, it could cause weaker investment performance, create greater exposure to market volatility and increase financial vulnerability for retirees.\n\n\u201cAs stewards of public funds, we have a responsibility to ensure that our investments provide stable, long-term returns over periods of decades,\u201d Delaware State Treasurer Colleen Davis told ESG Dive. \u201cIt is morally reprehensible and financially negligent to play politics with the American people\u2019s retirement savings and investments.\u201d\n\nActing SEC Chair Mark Uyeda and Acting Labor Secretary Vince Micone are currently in charge of two agencies who are defending a pair of ESG-linked regulations in court. Uyeda said last week he would seek a delay in arguments in lawsuits about the SEC\u2019s climate-risk disclosure rule, indicating the agency as constructed is not inclined to defend the rule. A federal judge recently ruled in favor of the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department on its regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral benefits in the case of a tiebreaker.

Views are the authors\u2019 own.\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act governs calls and text messages sent by businesses to consumers. One such rule is that businesses must obtain express written consent prior to sending text messages to consumers, if they are using an automated telephone dialing system or making calls using an artificial or pre-recorded voice, including the use of AI bots.\n\nThe TCPA also provides that businesses may not call or text consumers on the federal Do Not Call List unless prior express consent is given. Even basic telemarketing calls and text messages require prior express consent. Violation of the statute can trigger liability for up to $1,500 per call or text message sent.\n\nAdditionally, many states have their own version of the TCPA, deemed \u201cmini-TCPAs,\u201d that require compliance for all businesses who make calls to consumer-residents in that state, regardless of where the business is domiciled.\n\nLead generation\n\nMany companies use lead generators which gather consumer consents for multiple businesses and then provide the companies with consent and contact information for those potential consumers. Lead generators who obtain proper written consent can be a very useful tool for companies. This was generally permissible under the TCPA.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Federal Communications Commission updated its TCPA rules requiring \u201cone-to-one consent\u201d which was to become effective Jan. 27, 2025.\n\nThe one-to-one consent rule provides that if a business uses an ATDS, artificial or prerecorded voice, the business must obtain prior express consent, one seller at a time.\n\nThus, it prevents lead generators from using a single consumer\u2019s consent for multiple businesses. Additionally, the one-to-one consent rule provides that the consent must be clear and conspicuous, and the calls and texts initiated pursuant to the consent must be logically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent. This rule applies to both text messages and phone calls.\n\nOrder delayed\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2025, the FCC postponed the 2023 order by a year, until Jan. 26, 2026. Later that same day the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the 2023 Order, thus eliminating the one-to-one consent rule.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the FCC exceeded its statutory authority under the TCPA because the 2023 Order\u2019s new consent restrictions impermissibly conflict[ed] with the ordinary statutory meaning of prior express consent.\u201d\n\nNotably, the court ruled that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority at the outset, when it created the one-to-one consent rule. The court held that the 2023 Order\u2019s one-to-one prior express consent restriction impermissibly conflicted with the ordinary statutory meaning of \u201cprior express consent.\u201d Thus, the Court vacated application of the 2023 Order, and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nAs a result, it is very likely that we will see other cases challenging TCPA regulations, especially as to the consent required before making a telemarketing call or text message using an ATDS.\n\nAbundance of caution\n\nIt is unclear whether the FCC will revise its 2023 Order to comply with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision. In order to be prepared for this rule to come into effect, and in an abundance of caution, businesses who use lead generators to source potential consumers\u2019 consent should ascertain that the lead generators are obtaining individual, one-to-one consent.\n\nBusinesses should also only contact consumers who provide this consent for telemarketing that is logically and topically associated with that which the consent was provided. Further, in addition to storing consumer contact information, businesses must retain the consent forms, information as to when consent was given, and through whom. Even businesses that do not use lead generators to obtain consent should continue to review their consent practices to ensure strict compliance with the TCPA and mini-TCPAs.\n\nThe TCPA requires prior express consent, and in many cases, prior express written consent, for calls and text messages made to prospective consumers. Regardless of any changes to the TCPA, the FTSA still requires that businesses obtain prior express written consent when making unsolicited telephone calls (including sending text messages) using an automated system. And lastly, to further protect your business, the consent form should have robust terms of service, including a class action waiver.\n\nWe continue to recommend that businesses ensure compliance with the TCPA, FTSA, and any other state regulations by always obtaining express written consent prior to contacting potential consumers via calls or text messages.",

        "summary": "**FCC's One-to-One Telemarketing Consent Rule Vacated by Appeals Court**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 2023 Order, which established a \"one-to-one consent\" rule for telemarketing. This rule would have mandated specific, individual consent for each seller when businesses used automated dialing systems or pre-recorded voices. The court determined the FCC exceeded its statutory authority, stating the new consent restrictions conflicted with the ordinary meaning of \"prior express consent.\" Consequently, the one-to-one consent rule, originally set for Jan. 27, 2025 (then postponed to Jan. 26, 2026), is now eliminated.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe FCC's one-to-one consent rule was set to significantly restrict how lead generators could provide consumer consent to multiple businesses. The court's decision to vacate this rule removes an impending and substantial compliance burden on companies utilizing lead generation for telemarketing efforts. This challenges the prior consensus that businesses would need to overhaul their consent acquisition strategies and potentially face higher marketing costs, impacting sales outreach.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) governs how businesses can call and text consumers, generally requiring express written consent for automated systems. Violation of the TCPA can result in significant penalties, and many states have similar \"mini-TCPAs.\" Companies widely use lead generators to gather consumer consents, a practice historically permissible under the TCPA. The FCC's 2023 Order aimed to alter this by requiring more granular, one-to-one consent, which has now been overturned.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Up to $1,500 per call or text message: Potential liability for TCPA violations.\n*   Jan. 27, 2025: Original effective date for the FCC's 2023 one-to-one consent order.\n*   Jan. 24, 2025: Date the FCC postponed the order by one year.\n*   Jan. 26, 2026: Postponed effective date, which is now void after the court's ruling.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Communications Commission (FCC):** Updated TCPA rules in 2023, postponed its order, and was found by the court to have exceeded its statutory authority.\n*   **Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals:** Vacated the FCC's 2023 Order, ruling the FCC exceeded its authority under the TCPA.\n*   **Senosiain (associate at Gunster):** Author of the views expressed in the article.\n*   **Rollins (shareholder at Gunster):** Author of the views expressed in the article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   It is unclear whether the FCC will revise its 2023 Order to comply with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision.\n*   It is very likely other cases challenging TCPA regulations will emerge, particularly regarding consent for telemarketing calls/texts using automated systems.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nKey telemarketing consent rule vacated, but regulatory uncertainty persists for businesses.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nPactiv Evergreen will pay $6.25 million to settle a lawsuit with the state of North Carolina over the May 2023 closure of its plant in Canton.\n\nto settle a lawsuit with the state of North Carolina over the May 2023 closure of its plant in Canton. That amount is about 52% of the $12 million in economic development grant funding Pactiv received in 2014 from the state\u2019s Department of Commerce, which included an agreement to keep the site open and retain at least 800 jobs through Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nPactiv also agreed to drop its legal attempts to get refunds for its 2023 and 2024 property tax payments, which could have resulted in the company receiving $4.5 million. Plus, Pactiv will not bill the city of Canton for any wastewater treatment services it provided from 1964 through last month, when it sold the shuttered mill to demolition and environmental remediation company Spirtas Worldwide.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe paper mill in Canton had been in operation for more than 100 years prior to then-owner Pactiv shutting it down in 2023, according to the state of North Carolina. Blue Ridge Paper Products operated the facility since 1999, and in 2007 that company became Evergreen Packaging through a merger. Pactiv Evergreen formed in 2020 through the combination of Evergreen Packaging and Pactiv, both of which were previously acquired by Reynolds Group Holdings.\n\nAt the time of the Canton mill\u2019s closure, many people expressed surprise at Pactiv Evergreen\u2019s decision. The company made the announcement in March 2023 along with other closure and restructuring disclosures, and CEO Mike King noted a \u201cchallenging market environment\u201d for Pactiv\u2019s beverage merchandising business. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement last week that the Canton closure came as a \u201cgut punch\" to the local and state economies.\n\nUpon introducing the lawsuit in May 2024, then-Attorney General Josh Stein noted that taxpayers \u201cinvested in Pactiv Evergreen to bolster our state\u2019s economy,\u201d but Pactiv didn\u2019t hold up its end of the bargain. He said at the time that his office had tried working with Pactiv for a year to address the company\u2019s obligations, but it had \u201cbecome clear that legal action was necessary to hold Pactiv accountable.\u201d The initial lawsuit sought repayment of the full $12 million in economic incentives that Pactiv had received.\n\nThe settlement should not be viewed as an admission to wrongdoing, according to the North Carolina Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cPactiv broke its promise to the state and the people of Canton, and today\u2019s settlement holds it accountable for violating its agreement,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who was elected in November and took office last month, said of the new settlement. \u201cThis settlement will allow the people of Canton and Haywood County to immediately put millions back into rebuilding their economy after the mill\u2019s closure, and it will shield them from future litigation from Pactiv.\u201d\n\nThe candidates for state attorney general repeatedly brought up the mill issues on the campaign trail prior to November\u2019s election. Both candidates expressed a desire to hold Pactiv accountable.\n\nPactiv had filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in July 2024. But a judge denied that motion in October, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have resolved with the State of North Carolina all outstanding matters relating to the closure and sale of our former Canton mill site. We thank our employees for their contributions to our company and wish the Canton community well in this next chapter for the Town,\u201d said Pactiv Evergreen Tuesday in an emailed statement.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Pactiv\u2019s first legal battle over the Canton site.\n\nIn autumn 2023, the company reached a settlement worth more than $2 million with the U.S. EPA over Clean Air Act violations at Canton. Earlier that year, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality said the site violated water quality requirements; the company denied the allegations. In 2021 and 2022, the mill faced state air quality violations.\n\nNovolex is in the process of acquiring Pactiv Evergreen for $6.7 billion. The deal, which would take Pactiv private, is expected to close during the first half of this year.",

The $6.25 million payment aims to assist Canton and Haywood County in rebuilding their economies following the mill's closure, which was described as a \"gut punch.\" While the initial lawsuit sought the full $12 million in incentives, the agreed-upon $6.25 million settlement may indicate a less severe financial outcome for Pactiv than initially demanded by the state. This outcome could challenge an investor's prior expectation of a larger financial penalty for the company stemming from the contractual breach.\n\n**The big picture:** The Canton paper mill, operational for over 100 years, was shut down by Pactiv Evergreen in May 2023, a decision that surprised many. Pactiv Evergreen, formed in 2020, cited a \"challenging market environment\" for its beverage merchandising business as a reason for the closure. North Carolina sued the company in May 2024, asserting Pactiv did not meet its obligations under a 2014 economic development grant.

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order that expands his authority over independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve.\n\nUnder the order signed Tuesday, independent agencies must submit for review \u201csignificant\u201d regulations to a unit within the Office of Management and Budget, led by Russ Vought. The order gives Vought power over independent agencies\u2019 budgets and enables him to draft \u201cperformance standards and management objectives\u201d for independent agency heads. It also prohibits agencies from taking legal positions that differ from those of Trump or Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nThe order applies to the Fed as it relates to \u201cconduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions,\u201d but the Fed board and the Federal Open Market Committee would maintain independence over monetary policy.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAgencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission \u2013 which Congress established as independent from the White House \u2013 would also be affected by the order.\n\nThe carve-out for the Fed on monetary policy \u201cseems directed toward preventing a negative market reaction to the order,\u201d said Jeff Naimon, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at law firm Orrick.\n\nThe agencies also have to employ a White House liaison, and consult regularly on policy and priorities with the OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council and the White House National Economic Council, according to the order. The OMB will \u201cadjust so-called independent agencies\u2019 apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely,\u201d according to a fact sheet that accompanied the executive order.\n\n\u201cThese regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,\u201d the order said. \u201cMoreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\u201d\n\nThe move to expand Trump\u2019s authority is the latest by an administration that\u2019s sought to concentrate power under the executive branch. It also reflects the influence of Vought, one of the architects of conservative blueprint Project 2025, and broadens his supervisory powers. In addition to leading OMB, Vought also is acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u201cFor the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people\u2019s elected President,\u201d the order continued.\n\nNaimon noted there was strong coordination between independent agencies and the White House during Trump\u2019s prior administration, but the executive order would now require that coordination.\n\nLegal challenges to the order are \u201calmost certain,\u201d Kathryn Judge, a Columbia University professor of law, said in an email.\n\nThe outcome of any litigation is less clear, however, since the judiciary has embraced a more unitary view of the executive branch and a more expansive view of executive authority, she added.\n\nThe order \u201crepresents the largest single assertion over executive power over the administrative state that I can recall, not only in my lifetime but through history,\u201d Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said in an email. \u201cSome aspects of this control represent departures from long-standing norms. Others are in apparent contravention of statute and will be challenged legally.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much of the modern independent regulatory system survives the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts at consolidation is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d Conti-Brown said, noting that the Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed skepticism of independent agencies. SCOTUS did, however, uphold the funding structure of the CFPB.\n\nBanks may welcome the development in the near term, since the Trump administration is widely expected to usher in an era of reduced regulatory burden. But \u201cthose shifts would be far less enduring than if implemented in other ways,\u201d Judge said.\n\n\u201cLonger term, the result may be a whipsaw in regulatory and supervisory expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will make it harder for banks to make operational and other decisions that are core to their business.\u201d",

These complaints included various charges such as employers' tolerance of deadnaming, misgendering, and harassment, with some alleging retaliation and wrongful termination.\n\n**Why it matters:** This development signals a significant shift in the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) enforcement priorities regarding gender identity discrimination. It challenges the prior understanding that employers must adhere to protections for gender identity under Title VII, as established by the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. For companies, this could potentially alter their legal obligations and risks related to transgender worker discrimination claims. The agency's stated rationale for dismissal cites a past presidential executive order and guidance, indicating a policy change that may reduce the consensus view of legal exposure in this area.\n\n**The big picture:** The lawsuits were originally filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This law was interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. case to include employment discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The EEOC's decision to dismiss these cases follows an announcement by Acting Chair Andrea Lucas to \"roll back the Biden administration\u2019s gender identity agenda.\" The agency's stated reasoning for dismissal is potential inconsistency with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201cgender ideology extremism\u201d and associated Office of Personnel Management guidance.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Nearly every lawsuit:** The number of transgender discrimination lawsuits filed by EEOC in the previous year being targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Less than one month:** Timeframe between Acting Chair Andrea Lucas's announcement and the dismissal requests.\n*   **At least six:** The number of specific pending lawsuits EEOC filed motions to dismiss.\n*   **2020:** Year of the U.S. Supreme Court's Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. decision.\n*   **1964:** Year of the Civil Rights Act, under which the lawsuits were filed.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):** Federal agency now requesting dismissal of transgender discrimination lawsuits it previously filed.\n*   **Andrea Lucas:** Acting Chair of EEOC, announced gender identity agenda rollback before lawsuit dismissals.\n*   **HR Dive:** Media outlet that viewed court filings, confirming EEOC would not comment on litigation.\n*   **Holiday Inn Express owner:** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel owner:** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Illinois hog farm:** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Pizzeria (Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport):** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Wendy\u2019s operator (southern Illinois):** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **Lush (California\u2019s Bay Area):** Entity facing an EEOC lawsuit, now among those targeted for dismissal.\n*   **U.S. Supreme Court:** Ruled in 2020 that Title VII includes gender identity discrimination.\n*   **Bostock v.

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nA federal judge ruled that the Labor Department\u2019s regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral factors as a tiebreaker does not violate the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to court documents.\n\nTexas Northern District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled in favor Friday of a Biden administration agency motion for summary judgment and found that the agency\u2019s guidance is still valid under the Loper Bright ruling issued last year, which overturned that judicial standard of deferring to agencies\u2019 interpretations of ambiguous statutes in laws .\n\nKacsmaryk initially dismissed the lawsuit brought by a number of Republican-led states in September 2023 in a ruling relying on the now-overturned Chevron doctrine . The case was heard on appeal after Chevron\u2019s demise and sent back to Kacsmaryk to determine whether the rule could stand in a post-Chevron world.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Labor Department rule in question, \u201cPrudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,\u201d was finalized in 2022 and has been in effect since January 2023. The rule was designed to overturn guidance the agency issued in 2020 under the first Trump administration that forbade fiduciaries from utilizing \u201cnon-pecuniary\u201d factors in investment decisions.\n\nThe 2022 rule was designed to overturn a \u201cchilling effect\u201d that the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department said was witnessed under the 2020 rule. The guidance revised the agency\u2019s tiebreaker standard to allow for consideration of collateral benefits like ESG in the event that two or more investments would equally serve the plan\u2019s best interests but it would be imprudent to invest in both or all options.\n\nThe DOL rule has been repeatedly challenged by a coalition of 26 Republican-led states, who argued it runs afoul of ERISA and exceeded the agency\u2019s statutory authority. However, Kacsmaryk disagreed in his Feb. 14 ruling and said such a reading of the law \u201cembodies the wooden textualism that courts should endeavor to avoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the rule, a fiduciary faced with choosing between investment options \u2014 that all equally serve the beneficiaries' financial interests \u2014 does not advance the interests of nonbeneficiaries nor act for a purpose other than their financial benefit when he chooses based on collateral factors,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cPlaintiffs' interpretation of ERISA would demand arbitrary randomness to choose between such investment options.\u201d\n\nThe Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo case \u2014 which determined the fate of the Chevron doctrine \u2014 was decided in the time between Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial dismissal of the case and when the plaintiffs and the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department argued before the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June 2024 overturned the Chevron doctrine, which previously directed courts to give agencies deference in their interpretations of ambiguous law statutes.\n\nWhile the parties had opposing views on how Chevron\u2019s demise affected the case at hand, the Fifth Circuit refused to rule on the case, but vacated the initial dismissal and asked Kacsmaryk whether the rule can be squared with ERISA or the Administrative Procedure Act in light of Loper Bright.\n\nKacsmaryk said Loper Bright \u201cdid not disturb how courts evaluate a rule under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard,\u201d in his ruling Friday. He said the overturn of the Chevron doctrine should change how courts should interpret statutes, but not how they review the reasonableness of agency decisions.\n\nThe judge said that the tiebreaker standard in the 2022 rule does not violate ERISA\u2019s duty of loyalty nor its requirement that fiduciaries act \u201csolely\u201d and for the \u201cexclusive\u201d benefit of the plan\u2019s financial interests. Kacsmaryk said ERISA defines \u201cwhose interest the fiduciary must protect\u201d and what their purpose is, but \u201csays nothing of what they may consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as a driver, duty-bound to choose the fastest route to his destination, may choose the most scenic of two routes that each bring him to his destination at the same time, so too can a fiduciary choose a preferable investment option between two that will equally satisfy his duty of loyalty,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThe coalition of Republican-led states were also joined in their lawsuit by public oilfield services company Liberty Energy, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright served as CEO at the time. The plaintiffs have previously signaled a willingness to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, but first it will return to the Fifth Circuit panel that initially heard the arguments.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration\u2019s Labor Department will handle the case. Experts have previously expressed concerns about the DOL\u2019s rule being one of the Biden administration\u2019s ESG-related regulations likely to be put on the chopping block under Trump.",

Further, she asserted, it would make the CFPB\u2019s Consumer Response database \u201cunavailable and/or unreliable, severely hamper \u2014 if not entirely take down \u2014 the Bureau\u2019s website, and likely result in the loss of mandatory public reporting the Bureau has previously done.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s order may represent a relief to CFPB employees, but it doesn\u2019t apply to bureau employees who have already been terminated. The agency last Tuesday terminated roughly 70 probationary employees, then Thursday fired another 70 to 100 term employees \u2013 those whose contracts have set limits between one and four years.\n\nAltogether, last week\u2019s firings cut roughly 10% of the CFPB's workforce, according to American Banker.\n\nThe CFPB was not the only banking regulator to see workforce reductions last week. Roughly 500 employees at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or about 8% of its workforce, accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration, Bloomberg Law reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the agency.\n\nThe FDIC then terminated probationary employees, the outlet reported Monday, though the number of employees affected remained unclear.\n\nAn FDIC spokesperson on Friday did not detail how deeply certain units of the regulator were affected.\n\n\u2018Fait accompli\u2019\n\nA lawyer representing the CFPB workers\u2019 union laid out the urgency of Friday\u2019s court action.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m asking that they don't fire the entire agency tonight,\u201d Deepak Gupta, a founding principal at Gupta Wessler, told the court, according to American Banker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the courthouse without some assurance that the mass layoff is not going to happen and then become a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 union asked Thursday for a temporary restraining order to stop the firings, but agreed to seek a preliminary injunction instead.\n\nThat mirrors a case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in which the city of Baltimore sued the CFPB, claiming Vought\u2019s move to return the agency\u2019s funding to the Fed would effectively shut down the bureau \u201cby fiat.\u201d\n\nThe government agreed Thursday that Vought would refrain from transferring money out of the CFPB\u2019s reserve fund or returning money to the Fed or Treasury until Feb. 28, or upon a \u201ccontrary order\u201d from the court, Bloomberg Law reported.\n\nStill, in the workers\u2019 union case, Brad Rosenberg, a Justice Department special counsel, objected to the request for a preliminary injunction.\n\n\"We don't think any preliminary relief is appropriate at this stage because we don't think the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits,\" he said, according to American Banker.\n\nAmong the employees the CFPB terminated Thursday is Julia Barnard, who served as the agency\u2019s student loan ombudsman since last February. Her position is mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\u201cThis work matters,\u201d Barnard said in a statement issued by the Student Borrower Protection Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for borrowers and a safeguard against a system that too often fails them. Dismantling this function is unconscionable and will cost real people real money.\u201d\n\nDelaying any further moves to slash the CFPB workforce would at least give employees time to plan and budget for their personal futures. Employees of the agency are entitled by law to 60 days\u2019 notice of job loss. But last week\u2019s firings came with no notice and with immediate effect.\n\nFurther, terminations for cause (probationary employees, for example, were notified that they were deemed \u201cnot fit for continued employment because [their] ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs\u201d) left those employees without access to severance, one lawyer with the CFPB told ABC News.\n\nIn Vought\u2019s first week as the CFPB\u2019s acting director, the bureau\u2019s headquarters were closed to employees, who were ordered to stop all bureau work. A tip line was also set up for people to report on employees who might be conducting work.",

        "summary_text": "The politicians, provocateurs and think tanks that in the past few years have worked to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion may not appreciate the full consequences of their efforts.\n\nThey\u2019ve used a variety of tactics, in the public and private sectors, including White House executive orders; lawsuits or the threat of lawsuits; shareholder proposals; and needling on social media. They\u2019ve notched high-profile wins, most notably the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling against affirmative action and capitulation at several companies, including retailers and brands that have ended or scaled back their DEI programs.\n\nThe successful challenges, inevitably, are forcing scrutiny of DEI practices. But they also provide an opportunity to reinforce DEI goals and execution, which David Glasgow, executive director of New York University\u2019s Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, sees as a silver lining.\n\nIndeed, the victories are hardly universal. Because diversity, equity and inclusion are good for business for a variety of reasons, most companies are not abandoning DEI. So far in 2025, Target, Nike and Costco are among those that have defended at least some aspects of their policies (in Costco\u2019s case, vociferously). As the Heritage Foundation, a major DEI foe, noted in November, most Fortune 500 companies continue to publicly commit to DEI.\n\n\u201cIt is a time for companies to refine and strengthen their inclusion efforts in ways that reduce the risk in the short term \u2014 because the risk is real, and we know that \u2014 and in ways that are sustainable in the long term,\u201d said Adrienne Pulido, vice president of inclusion insights at Kantar. \u201cSo it is looking at both ends of the spectrum, in terms of being very clear about what inclusion means to their business.\u201d\n\nWhat DEI is and isn\u2019t\n\nDEI is being pilloried as discriminatory and unfair, yet these systems are designed to create a business that is neither. That is, a business where employees have a variety of backgrounds and perspectives (diversity); hiring, promotion and other actions are executed fairly (equity); and the culture is comfortable and inviting to all who work there (inclusion).\n\n\u201cUnpacking what DEI is and what inclusion is, is part of this moment we're in and part of the conversation that companies need to have about their strategies,\u201d Pulido said by video conference. \u201cWhat does DEI mean to the business itself? What does it mean to the business and to the future business? Because the demographics of the country are changing, and our research shows that inclusion as a concept, as an idea, is very popular among Americans of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\nDEI goals for most companies are more important than ever because the markets for their products and services are more diverse than they were a decade or more ago, according to Effenus Henderson, who has worked in recruiting, staffing and succession planning at companies in the U.S. and abroad since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThis attack is amplified through the use of social media and technology and psychometrics, where emotions get aroused and reinforced,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cBut fundamental to all this is that DEI is not about creating systems that are discriminatory, or about quotas, or a focus on one thing at the exclusion of others. I don't think organizations have really done that. What they have been doing is really trying to expand participation because of the growing demographic change that we're seeing.\u201d\n\nThe need to develop DEI strategies that fit with and further business strategies dictates the involvement of leadership, according to Henderson. Too often, though, they are left to the human resources department, leaving companies at risk of adopting DEI programming that is ineffective and possibly indefensible.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are able to navigate this generally are the ones where leadership has spent the time talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about reacting to the George Floyd situation or to civil rights laws or litigation. It's really, \u2018How do we integrate this as a part of the DNA of who we are as an organization?\u2019 If your organization is more performative, then they don't really understand how it helps to shape business strategy and policy.\u201d\n\nDEI should be treated like any other strategic priority, according to Tim Heneveld, country director for Pergolux in North America. With DEI under the spotlight, it\u2019s a good moment to reassess whether hiring, workplace environment, leadership and operational strategies fit with broader aims.\n\n\u201cThat means setting measurable goals, using data to track impact, and holding leadership accountable,\u201d Heneveld said by email. \u201cSome organizations are feeling pressure to scale back DEI, but I think doing so would be shortsighted. Instead, companies should refine their DEI strategies, aligning them with long-term business goals rather than reacting to what they are seeing in the media or any other outside factors. I've experienced, firsthand, workplaces can attract top talent, strengthen their teams, and improve retention.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, companies are continuing with their DEI efforts, but changing the names of their initiatives or titles of their employees, experts said.\n\nCrafting DEI initiatives and training is always a work in progress because businesses, markets and demographics evolve, according to Henderson. For many companies, that may mean avoiding those three letters of the alphabet, or the words \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d But that, too, requires some thought, he said.\n\n\u201cIs continuing to refer to it under those banners still appropriate, and if I look at renaming it, am I doing that to help enhance our appeal to the markets of the customers and employees we serve? Are we doing it as a reactive, defensive thing for a short-term issue that's hot and heavy right now?\u201d he said. \u201cGet clarity around your objectives, the alignment with your strategies, and then decide whether how you are framing it today will work for you tomorrow and the day after. At some companies, it may mean one thing, and to others it may mean something else.\u201d\n\nThe legal concerns\n\nThe list of lawsuits against DEI programs tracked by the Meltzer Center is long, and getting longer.\n\nMost of these claims invoke civil rights laws intended to end or prevent unfair hiring practices or contracts. Frequently that includes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, barring discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin; Section 1981 of the federal code barring discrimination in contracts; and the U.S. Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, according to Glasgow. The Meltzer Center advises companies to avoid DEI practices that give preference to members of certain groups and involve a tangible benefit.\n\nEvaluating whether a company\u2019s DEI programs run afoul of the latest interpretations of these codes entails enlisting attorneys or other compliance experts.\n\n\u201cThis has become a thriving legal practice area,\u201d Glasgow said.\n\nAny business strategy should always be grounded in risk mitigation, and this is just another place for companies to check, according to Henderson. Companies may learn that, to avoid risk, certain aspects of their DEI programs should change.\n\nOthers may find that they pass muster. In its proxy statement urging shareholders to vote against a proposal that could have weakened its DEI programs, Costco\u2019s board of directors made clear that the retailer regularly evaluates its \u201cpractices concerning compliance with law, including evolving Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nIn describing how Costco obeys the law and does not discriminate in hiring, promotion and other practices, the board also provided a litany of protected statuses. This is a reminder that, while civil rights statutes are being leveraged to overturn DEI practices, they nevertheless do bar discrimination for a host of reasons. Moreover, any company that does business abroad will encounter antidiscrimination law that isn\u2019t being disrupted by political activism the way it is in the U.S., Henderson said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Canada, Europe, Asia and South America, there are regulations and laws that support and value diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo backing away from DEI may, in fact, create harm for your business strategies in other parts of the world. It's not a simple answer, and it just depends on who you are.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem like DEI programs are quickly getting scrapped in order to avoid controversy, most are simply under review, Glasgow and others said.\n\n\u201cI think it's prompting a much deeper reflection within companies, not just on what is strictly legal or illegal in what we're doing, but on what has been working and what has not been working,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cCould we be doing this work more effectively, in a way that actually helps us achieve our business goals, or helps us create the kind of culture that we want to create? Are there things that have been low impact, or maybe even have a negative impact, that we should get rid of, even if it's not for legal reasons? I think the moment that we're living in now could be a helpful reset moment for the field.\u201d",

Most companies are not abandoning DEI programs, defending them due to business benefits and changing demographics. Some companies are continuing DEI efforts by renaming initiatives or employee titles. Legal concerns are prompting companies to evaluate and refine DEI practices to mitigate risk and ensure compliance.\n\n**Why it matters:** DEI is considered good for business, aligning with changing market demographics and attracting top talent. Despite high-profile challenges and legal pressures, most companies are not abandoning DEI but are refining and strengthening their efforts. This challenges a potential consensus that DEI is universally being dismantled, showing many companies view it as a strategic business imperative. Companies also face international anti-discrimination laws, meaning backing away from DEI could harm global business strategies.\n\n**The big picture:** DEI initiatives have faced significant challenges from politicians, provocateurs, and think tanks using tactics like lawsuits and executive orders. These challenges have led to high-profile wins, including the Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action. Despite this, most Fortune 500 companies continue to publicly commit to DEI. DEI is defined as creating diverse employees, fair practices, and inclusive cultures, driven by changing country demographics and diverse markets.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2025:** Target, Nike, and Costco have defended DEI policies.\n*   **Most Fortune 500 companies:** Continue to publicly commit to DEI.\n*   **Since the 1970s:** Effenus Henderson has worked in recruiting and staffing.\n*   **A decade or more ago:** Markets for products and services are more diverse than previously.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Target, Nike, Costco:** Companies that have defended at least some aspects of their DEI policies in 2025.\n*   **Heritage Foundation:** A major DEI opponent, noted most Fortune 500 companies' continued public DEI commitment.\n*   **David Glasgow (NYU Meltzer Center):** Executive director who sees scrutiny of DEI as an opportunity to reinforce goals.\n*   **Adrienne Pulido (Kantar):** Vice president who suggests companies refine and strengthen inclusion efforts to reduce risk.\n*   **Effenus Henderson:** Expert who emphasizes DEI's importance for diverse markets and the need for leadership involvement.\n*   **Tim Heneveld (Pergolux):** Country director who advocates for aligning DEI with long-term business goals for talent and retention.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** DEI faces legal pressures, but companies are refining, not abandoning, for business gains.",

        "summary_text": "Acting Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mark Uyeda\u2019s decision last week to ask the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay arguments for the agency\u2019s climate risk disclosure rule did not come as a surprise to regulatory experts in the space.\n\nWhile the change is expected to have minimal immediate impact, it sets the stage for a shift in focus for the SEC under the Trump administration.\n\nThe SEC issued its long-awaited climate-risk disclosure rule last March, nearly two years after it was first proposed \u2014 and amid over 24,000 public comments. Uyeda was one of two commissioners to vote against the rule\u2019s approval. The rule was immediately met with multiple lawsuits that were later consolidated into the Eighth Circuit. The spate of legal challenges led the agency to stay the rule\u2019s implementation in April.\n\nGiven the agency\u2019s stay and the change in administration, Tom Willman, regulatory lead for artificial intelligence sustainability platform Clarity AI, said Uyeda\u2019s decision came \u201cas no great surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nevertheless disappointing that investors will be deprived of much-needed financially material information related to climate related risks,\u201d Willman said by email Wednesday.\n\nJulie Gorte, senior vice president of sustainable investing at Impax Asset Management was more blunt in an interview: \u201cThe only person on the planet who didn't see this coming was Rip Van Winkle,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\nUyeda\u2019s recommended pullback on defending the SEC climate rule follows his prior critiques of the rule. During the hearing on the final climate rule, in the weeks after it was finalized and in his Feb. 11 statement announcing the delay request, Uyeda maintained his belief that the SEC does not have the authority to promulgate the rule or require such disclosures.\n\nJenner & Block Partner Jennifer Lee, a former assistant director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said Uyeda\u2019s position is \u201cconsistent with the new, Republican-led SEC\u2019s shift back to focusing on \u2018bread and butter\u2019 investor disclosure issues.\u201d Lee, who now represents companies and financial institutions in regulatory investigations and litigation, told ESG Dive in emailed comments Thursday that she expects that focus to include an emphasis on materiality, while looking to avoid \u201coverly prescriptive disclosure requirements for public companies.\u201d\n\nThe change in SEC posture, however, is expected to have a minimal impact for companies or investors, according to Willman and Gorte.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this is going to be extraordinarily minimal, partly because it was never enforced in the first place,\u201d Gorte said Wednesday. \u201cSo we never had better climate reporting stimulated by U.S. regulatory postures to begin with. And for U.S. companies, or for any company really, a lot of the big ones are probably still going to have to be reporting on all the same things that were in that rule because of [other jurisdictions].\u201d\n\nWillman echoed that note and said that many U.S. companies already voluntarily report climate risks due to investor demand, in addition to growing regulatory requirements both overseas in jurisdictions like the European Union, and stateside in California. New York recently reintroduced its own version of California\u2019s climate disclosure laws.\n\nAdditionally, Stephen O\u2019Day, a partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, noted the intervenors in the case could continue the rule\u2019s defense, even though the SEC\u2019s announcement indicates this iteration of the agency is not inclined to defend the rules. In the case of the climate rule, 18 states and the District of Columbia have signed on as intervenors to support the agency\u2019s rule.\n\nO\u2019Day said a similar process happened after intervenors continued the defense for enforcement actions taken by the Clinton-era administration for violations of the Clean Air Act by coal-fired plants. Ultimately, the intervenors prevailed, and the Supreme Court upheld the actions.\n\n\u201cThe proceedings pending in the Eighth Circuit involve challenges filed by multiple parties and intervenors, any of which could seek to continue defense of the SEC rules,\u201d O\u2019Day said. \u201cSo, while the court may grant the requested 45-day pause, it remains to be seen whether any such pause will result in the end of the SEC\u2019s final rules.\u201d\n\nRegardless, sustainability programs and disclosures are expected to continue.\n\n\u201cRegulatory shifts don\u2019t change the fundamental reality: physical climate risk is already priced into markets,\u201d Lukky Ahmed, CEO of climate risk data and analytics platform Climate X, said by email Wednesday. Firms have a fiduciary responsibility to continue to assess, manage and disclose climate risks to their operations, Ahmed said.\n\n\u201cIntegrating climate resilience and adaptation strategies isn\u2019t just prudent \u2014 it\u2019s essential for maintaining business performance, driving shareholder returns, and protecting communities,\" Ahmed said.\n\nDespite the shifting federal policy stance, \u201cthere is a lot of faith that the drivers of sustainability remain in place no matter who is in anyone's White House,\u201d Gorte told ESG Dive.\n\n\u201cIf we don't solve the climate crisis, there are going to be \u2026 parts of the globe that are probably uninhabitable, or where people can't work outdoors in the summer. If we don't solve the biodiversity crisis, the prospects are even worse.\u201d Gorte said. \u201cSo there are things that we have to do in order to preserve what we think of as life as we know it, and those drivers are going to remain in place.\u201d",

Wells Fargo has denied that allegation.\n\nThe labor board wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union despite the vote, based on a 2023 precedent case. The 2023 Cemex ruling strengthened the NLRB's power to compel companies that violate labor laws to recognize unions.\n\nHowever, Republicans and business groups oppose the precedent. The acting general counsel of NLRB, William Cowen, or his permanent replacement, could withdraw, amend, or settle the Wells Fargo complaint.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Cowen acting general counsel this month, days after firing NLRB\u2019s previous chief lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo, a Biden appointee, and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox.\n\nThe email notifying Wilcox of her termination said she was being fired since she did not \u201cshare the objectives\u201d of the present administration. Wilcox\u2019s ouster has left the board with only two members coupled with existing vacancies and does not meet the minimum number of members needed to adjudicate routine cases.\n\nWilcox is suing Trump, alleging the president surpassed his authority in firing her and requesting that she be allowed to resume her work as an NLRB member.\n\nThe NLRB complaint does not signify a complete investigation or a full adjudication of the allegations; rather, the regional office found that the allegations may be sufficient to go to a hearing to consider all evidence and make credibility determinations, a Wells Fargo spokesperson noted.\n\nEmployees at the Atwater branch voted 3-1 to reject unionization in January 2024. The branch manager allegedly told staff she knew about organizing discussions and warned about camera surveillance. She also reportedly told workers that Wells Fargo would apply stricter work conditions and would make union supporters stay longer hours.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank trains its managers to respect the rights of its employees to freely associate and join or support a union, or to bargain collectively with a representative of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWe train our managers to comply with labor law and respect the rights of our employees,\u201d the spokesperson told Banking Dive via email. \u201cIn this case, the majority of eligible employees freely voted against a union in a Board supervised secret ballot election and the facts do not support allegations to the contrary.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo is cooperating with the investigation but believes these allegations are unfounded and plans to defend the company and employees, the spokesperson added.\n\nAn NLRB hearing before a judge is scheduled for October, and Wells Fargo, if ordered to collectively bargain, can appeal to NLRB members in Washington, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRecently, unionized Wells Fargo employees hit a new challenge in organizing. The bank's conduct management intake team won its union vote 21-16 in December, making it the first non-branch unit at Wells Fargo to unionize.\n\nThe team, which handles customer and employee complaints across various locations, has now filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB through Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA. The complaint alleges that the bank illegally refuses to engage in collective bargaining following the certified union vote, American Banker reported. However, the bank contends it\u2019s waiting for the outcome of the NLRB\u2019s review and claims there were procedural flaws in the handling of the vote.\n\nCWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year, with around 200 employees being organized.\n\nWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf pushed back on employee unionization efforts last April, saying it\u2019s important to \u201cmake clear that we continue to believe that our employees are best served by working directly with Wells Fargo and our leadership team.\u201d",

        "summary": "Here is the summary of the provided article in the Smart Brevity style:\n\n**Headline:** Wells Fargo faces NLRB union-busting claims amid leadership shifts.\n\n**Key details:**\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has accused Wells Fargo of illegally threatening and coercing employees to prevent fair union votes at a California branch. Most employees at the Atwater branch, despite signing union cards, later voted against unionization. The NLRB wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union, citing the 2023 Cemex precedent. Wells Fargo denies the allegations, stating employees freely voted against unionization and the bank is cooperating. Separately, Wells Fargo\u2019s recently unionized conduct management team also filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging the bank refuses to bargain.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis matters because the NLRB's use of the Cemex precedent could compel Wells Fargo to bargain with a union, challenging the bank's assertion that employees freely rejected unionization. This could create a new, forced path for labor organizing within financial institutions, potentially impacting Wells Fargo's operational flexibility and labor costs. The recent firings and appointments within NLRB leadership, alongside a lawsuit against President Trump, add a layer of political uncertainty to the complaint's outcome. These developments highlight a growing push for unionization within the banking sector, challenging the traditional non-union status quo.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe NLRB's complaint follows a strengthening of its power through the 2023 Cemex ruling, which allows it to compel union recognition after labor law violations; this precedent is opposed by Republicans and business groups. Recent leadership changes at the NLRB include President Trump appointing William Cowen as acting general counsel after firing Biden appointee Jennifer Abruzzo and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox. Wilcox is suing Trump, alleging overreach, and her ouster has left the NLRB with insufficient members to adjudicate routine cases. CWA has successfully unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches with approximately 200 employees, demonstrating broader unionization efforts within the bank.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Atwater branch employees voted 3-1 to reject unionization in January 2024.\n*   The NLRB complaint against Wells Fargo was filed on February 11.\n*   Wells Fargo's conduct management intake team unionized with a 21-16 vote in December.\n*   CWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year, organizing around 200 employees.\n*   The NLRB board has only two members after Wilcox's ouster, lacking the minimum for routine cases.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):** Accused Wells Fargo of illegally threatening and coercing employees regarding unionization.\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Denies NLRB allegations of labor law violations, stating employees freely voted against unionization.\n*   **William Cowen:** Trump-appointed acting general counsel of the NLRB, could influence the Wells Fargo complaint.\n*   **Jennifer Abruzzo:** Former NLRB chief lawyer, a Biden appointee, fired by President Trump this month.\n*   **Gwynne Wilcox:** Democratic NLRB board member, fired by President Trump, now suing him over alleged overreach.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Appointed Cowen and fired Abruzzo and Wilcox, who is now suing him.\n*   **CWA:** Unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches and represents the newly unionized conduct management team.\n*   **Charlie Scharf:** Wells Fargo CEO, stated last April employees are best served working directly with the bank.\n*   **Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA:** Filed an unfair labor practice charge for the newly unionized conduct management team.\n*   **Republicans and business groups:** Oppose the 2023 Cemex precedent, which strengthened NLRB's power.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   An NLRB hearing before a judge regarding the Atwater branch allegations is scheduled for October.\n*   Wells Fargo is awaiting the outcome of the NLRB's review regarding the conduct management team's union vote.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWells Fargo faces escalating union challenges amidst a politically charged labor landscape.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCaterpillar is bracing for tariff headwinds between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for the year despite mitigation and cost control efforts, CFO Andrew Bonfield said during a second quarter earnings call Tuesday.\n\nThe construction and mining equipment maker saw a nearly $350 million tariff impact in Q2, and is expecting higher trade-related costs in Q3 and Q4, Bonfield said. The Trump administration\u2019s country-specific tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 7 , barring any extensions.\n\nCaterpillar generated total Q2 sales and revenue of $16.6 billion , down 1% from last year. This was driven by declines in the company\u2019s construction and mining segments, and buoyed by positive energy and transportation results.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAlthough affected by tariffs, Caterpillar saw solid demand for its products as lower manufacturing costs offset volume gains in the quarter. The company is seeing robust activity from its power generation business, supported by growing demand for AI data centers. The company\u2019s Q2 net profit fell 19% to $2.2 billion from last year.\n\nFor the construction business, Caterpillar reported unfavorable pricing and lower sales volumes related to dealer inventory changes in North America and Latin America. Meanwhile, sales increased in the Asia Pacific and Europe-Africa-Middle East regions. The construction unit made a Q2 profit of $1.2 billion, down 29% from a year ago.\n\nUnfavorable pricing also weighed on Caterpillar\u2019s resource industries business, responsible for mining and quarry customers. The segment made a profit of $537 million, down 25% year-over-year. The company cited tariffs, lower sales volumes and unfavorable manufacturing costs as factors in the decline.\n\n\u201cWhile we have taken initial mitigating actions to reduce the impact, tariff and trade negotiations continue to be fluid,\u201d CEO Joseph Creed said during the call. \u201cWe will remain flexible and we intend to implement longer-term actions once there is sufficient certainty. We are considering all options to further reduce the impact of tariffs going forward.\u201d\n\nAs heavy machinery sales slipped, Caterpillar had robust order activity in the energy and transportation segment. Power generation, for example, saw quarterly sales grow 19% from a year ago, due to demand for reciprocating engines for data centers, Creed said.\n\n\u201cWe continue to stay close to our largest data center customers and receive regular feedback on their long-term demand,\u201d Creed added.\n\nThe energy and transportation segment posted a Q2 profit of $1.6 billion, up 4% YoY. Caterpillar also saw its financial products segment profit grow 4% to $1 billion over the same period.\n\nLooking ahead, Creed said Caterpillar is forecasting Q3 sales to grow moderately versus last year, with higher volumes across all three of the company\u2019s major segments. However, tariffs will squeeze profit margins lower than last year, he said. Creed also forecasted full-year sales and revenue to be up slightly over 2024.\n\nCaterpillar is implementing a number of quick, easily reversible actions to mitigate the tariffs impact. It\u2019s cutting discretionary spending and leaning into limited dual-sourcing where beneficial, Creed said. The company is also working on making more goods compliant under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, he added.\n\n\u201cThe net impact of tariffs was around the top end of our estimated range for the quarter and is likely to be a more significant headwind to profitability in the second half of 2025,\u201d Creed said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Caterpillar Profits Squeezed by Tariffs Amid Mixed Segment Performance\n\n**Key details:**\nCaterpillar forecasts $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in tariff headwinds for the year, with a nearly $350 million impact in Q2. Total Q2 sales and revenue declined 1% to $16.6 billion, leading to a 19% drop in net profit to $2.2 billion. This was driven by declines in construction and mining segments, despite positive energy and transportation results. The company is implementing quick mitigation actions like cutting discretionary spending and dual-sourcing. Tariffs are expected to be a more significant headwind to profitability in the second half of 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nCaterpillar's significant tariff headwinds, expected to reach up to $1.5 billion for the year, are squeezing profit margins lower. Despite solid demand for its products and mitigation efforts, Q2 net profit fell 19% and key segments saw steep profit declines. This suggests that current company actions are not fully offsetting tariff impacts, which are forecasted to be a \"more significant headwind to profitability in the second half of 2025.\" This might challenge a consensus view assuming effective tariff mitigation or stable profit growth, given the broad impact on earnings despite positive segment performance.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCaterpillar, a major construction and mining equipment maker, is grappling with the ongoing impact of the Trump administration\u2019s country-specific tariffs. These tariffs, which created a nearly $350 million impact in Q2, are generating significant cost pressures for the company. While Caterpillar is implementing quick, reversible mitigation actions like cutting discretionary spending and limited dual-sourcing, trade negotiations remain fluid. This fluidity prevents the company from implementing longer-term actions until there is sufficient certainty regarding trade policies.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$1.3 billion - $1.5 billion:** Anticipated full-year tariff headwinds.\n*   **$350 million:** Nearly this amount for Q2 tariff impact.\n*   **$16.6 billion:** Total Q2 sales and revenue, down 1%.\n*   **$2.2 billion:** Q2 net profit, a 19% decline.\n*   **$1.2 billion:** Construction unit Q2 profit, down 29%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Caterpillar:** Global construction and mining equipment maker facing significant tariff headwinds and profit declines.\n*   **Andrew Bonfield:** CFO detailing tariff impacts and Q2 financial results during earnings call.\n*   **Joseph Creed:** CEO discussing fluid trade negotiations, mitigation efforts, and segment performance.\n*   **Trump administration:** Its country-specific tariffs are directly impacting Caterpillar's costs and profitability.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Tariffs from the Trump administration are set to take effect August 7, barring extensions.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTariffs severely squeeze Caterpillar's profits, overshadowing mixed segment performance and mitigation efforts.",

The autonomous logistics operations demonstration involved a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, which flew more than 3,900 miles between military bases and airports across California and Nevada to deliver cargo, including aircraft parts and supplies.\n\nAdditionally, Joby showed that its platform can be modified to deliver longer ranges. Last July, the company showcased a hydrogen-electric air taxi that flew over 500 miles, generating water as the only by-product.\n\nJoby has been working with the U.S. Department of Defense since 2016 through its Defense Innovation Unit, the agency\u2019s research and development organization. The company worked with the DIU to advance Joby\u2019s aircraft for commercial and military use.\n\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Air Force awarded Joby a contract through its R&D wing, AFWERX Agility Prime, which focuses on accelerating the commercial market for advanced air mobility as well as creating a domestic supply chain. The agreement supported Joby\u2019s commercial business goals while also exploring various future uses for the government, according to the military branch\u2019s press release.\n\nThe Air Force has since extended Joby\u2019s contract three times. The latest extension was in 2023 for nine aircraft valued at $131 million. Joby delivered the second plane last year.\n\n\u201cWe have worked closely with the Department of Defense over the past decade to give them a front row seat to the development of our dual-purpose technologies, and we\u2019re now ready to demonstrate and deploy it,\u201d JoeBen Bevirt, Joby Aviation CEO, said in a statement.\n\nOther electric VTOL makers are partnering up with defense contractors and the U.S. military. Last August, Archer Aviation delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the Air Force under its AFWERX Agility Prime contract valued at up to $142 million.\n\nThen in December 2024, the plane manufacturer announced a partnership with defense startup Anduril Industries to develop a cost-effective hybrid VTOL aircraft in pursuit of an unnamed DOD program.",

After DuPont and Corteva recover the $150 million plus a fee, Chemours will claim 50% of its share of the insurance recoveries.\n\nDuPont has made several corporate restructuring moves in recent years. In 2017, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., DuPont\u2019s former formal company title and referred to as \u201cOld DuPont\u201d in court documents, merged with Dow Chemical Co. for $130 billion. The plan was to break up the conglomerate into three different businesses.\n\nTwo years later, the conglomerate was dissolved and broke into three separate entities: DuPont de Nemours, a specialty products business referred to as \u201cNew DuPont\u201d in court documents, Corteva, an agriculture business, and Dow, a materials science business. DuPont is once again planning to split the company into two separate, independent entities.\n\nIn March 2019, New Jersey\u2019s DEP issued a mandate to E.I. DuPont de Nemours, then conglomerate DowDuPont and Chemours \u2014 along with 3M and Solvay Specialty Polymers USA \u2014 to fund the state\u2019s PFAS assessment and cleanup efforts.\n\nThe state then sued the chemical manufacturers listed in the directive. Solvay reached a $392.7 million settlement with NJDEP in 2023. Its co-defendant in the lawsuit, Arkema, which previously owned the same site, agreed to settle its part of the alleged contamination, including paying $33.95 million for remediation and damages as well as committing $75 million for a reserve fund.\n\nIn May, 3M reached a proposed agreement with the state\u2019s environmental protection agency to pay up to $450 million to resolve all of its legacy PFAS-related claims in New Jersey.\n\nThe state is expected to recover more than $3 billion from the lawsuits, which will compensate New Jersey and mitigate the damage caused by PFAS and other pollutants, according to Platkin\u2019s press release.\n\n\u201cThis landmark settlement will advance New Jersey\u2019s nation-leading PFAS abatement efforts, improve drinking water quality, and restore injured natural resources,\u201d Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said in a statement. \u201cThis resolution embodies the steadfast commitment of the Department of Environmental Protection and our Attorney General to hold all PFAS polluters to account, and to protect public health, safety, and the environment from these harmful chemicals.\u201d\n\nDuPont\u2019s New Jersey settlement follows another agreement the company made recently. In June, the chemical manufacturer reached a $27 million agreement to settle a 2016 class-action lawsuit with the towns of Hoosick and Hoosick Falls, New York, to resolve alleged contamination with perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, according to the plantiff attorney\u2019s press release.\n\nDuPont was the last to settle in the New York case. 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell settled in 2021 for approximately $65.3 million.",

This deal is valued at over $2.5 billion, including an $875 million payment over 25 years. The agreement also establishes a remediation fund of up to $1.2 billion and a $475 million backup reserve fund for cleanup work. Chemours will contribute 50% (~$250M) of the settlement payments, with DuPont contributing 35.5% (~$177M) and Corteva 14.5% (~$72M). Additionally, DuPont and Corteva will pay $150 million to purchase specific insurance proceeds from Chemours.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis proposed agreement is designated by New Jersey as a \"groundbreaking environmental settlement\" aimed at advancing the state's PFAS abatement efforts and improving environmental quality. For investors, this large settlement explicitly resolves a major legacy PFAS liability for these specific companies in New Jersey, reducing uncertainty around these claims. The scale of this $2.5 billion settlement, following other significant agreements mentioned in the article, could challenge a prior consensus that PFAS-related liabilities might be smaller or more easily managed. It underscores the substantial financial commitment required from polluters to address widespread contamination, potentially setting a precedent for future environmental claims in the industry.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis settlement stems from New Jersey's March 2019 mandate and subsequent lawsuits against chemical manufacturers for PFAS assessment and cleanup. It follows a complex corporate restructuring history for DuPont, which merged with Dow in 2017 and later split into DuPont, Corteva, and Dow in 2019. This agreement is part of broader state efforts, as New Jersey expects to recover over $3 billion from various PFAS lawsuits. Other companies like Solvay, Arkema, and 3M have already reached significant settlements with New Jersey regarding similar claims.

        "summary_text": "As billions of dollars in promised funding flood the U.S. semiconductor industry, manufacturers are increasingly turning their attention to a key issue: Water usage.\n\nIn the U.S. \u2014 where domestic chip manufacturing capacity could triple by 2032\u2014 water sustainability isn\u2019t just a PR strategy. It\u2019s central to both success and survival.\n\n\u201cWater is actually the largest volume chemical used in semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d said Paul Westerhoff, a regents professor in Arizona State University\u2019s School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment.\n\nPrior research has found that semiconductor production can require up to 10 million gallons of ultrapure water per day, a grade of H2O that\u2019s virtually free of all impurities. This is more than the daily amount used by 33,000 households, according to the U.S. EPA. Residual salts and chemicals risk decreasing performance and power efficiencies, as well as the integrity of the wafer overall, said Westerhoff.\n\nFor chip manufacturers, the challenge lies in not just securing high volumes of ultrapure water, or UPW, but also in purifying it to a usable degree and recycling the wastewater within the manufacturer\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking parts-per-quadrillon-level purity,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, co-founder and COO of water treatment solutions provider Gradiant. \u201cTo put that in perspective, parts per quadrillon is like having one molecule of impurity in an entire Olympic swimming pool of water.\u201d\n\nTo address challenges in the quantity and high quality of UPW, manufacturers are reducing their water consumption, repurposing it within facilities, discharging it into the community and replacing other water resources with reclaimed water. But sources say much more is needed \u2014 and possible \u2014 to make semiconductor manufacturing\u2019s water use a sustainable enterprise.\n\nReducing water footprints inside and outside the fence\n\nDeveloping wastewater recycling and reclamation technologies is a long and challenging journey, particularly given the complexity of industrial wastewater, said a spokesperson for major chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nTSMC achieved 12% replacement of water resources with reclaimed water in 2023, the most recent data available, meeting its target of 5%. In 2022, the manufacturer also opened a new industrial reclaimed-water plant.\n\nHowever, the company missed its target of reducing unit water consumption by 2.7%; increasing it instead by 25.2% in 2023.\n\nThe stringent purity levels required by UPW pose a significant challenge for manufacturers aspiring for the highest levels of water stewardship, in part because they often draw on water from municipal utilities.\n\nAccording to Govindan, it\u2019s common to have 15 to 18 grades of wastewater, with different levels of contamination and different matrices of wastewater quality. UPW must be heavily filtered beyond what\u2019s mandated for drinking water.\n\n\u201cOne major challenge we faced was addressing one of the most critical but stubborn factors in wastewater treatment \u2014 small-molecule organic compounds such as urea from residential wastewater \u2014 which cannot be removed using membranes and require specialized techniques,\u201d said a spokesperson for TSMC. \u201cRemoving urea to meet the stringent water quality standards for semiconductor processes involved extensive collaboration across industry, academia, and research institutions.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, as with TSMC, manufacturers partner with water service providers early in the planning process to combat the purification process challenge, even planning them into the plant\u2019s setup, said Govindan.\n\nThen, manufacturers seek to reduce their water footprint both \u201coutside the fences of a manufacturing facility\u201d \u2014 which is more cost-effective, said Westerhoff \u2014 and \u201cinside the fence.\u201d\n\nOften, fabrication plant treatment standards go beyond the wastewater treatment requirements imposed by EPA regulations and local authorities. For instance, local sewer use ordinances in Chandler, Arizona, have set pollutant limits but not water restoration limits, enabling Intel\u2019s Phoenix-area fab to surpass both quality standards and restore more water than it consumes.\n\n\u201cWhat Intel and some other companies do is they purify things and then move it outside the fence, and that water is reused within the community. Some of them will purify it [so] it meets every drinking water limit, or recharge it into the groundwater. And then what some companies are doing is outside the fence \u2014 not downstream from the company, but actually upstream,\u201d said Westerhoff. All of those best practices can help a business qualify as \u201cnet water positive,\u201d he said.\n\nSome manufacturers also use up to 40% of their wastewater to control a fab\u2019s temperature via cooling towers, or in a scrubber machine, which sprays water and \u201cscrubs\u201d off gases and other chemical contaminants, said Westerhoff.\n\nMany manufacturers might also opt for \u201coutside the fence\u201d water sustainability strategies due to the sheer technical difficulties in recycling water into UPW.\n\nAccording to a June article in WE&T Magazine, usually \u201cthe recovered or reclaimed water is not recycled back into production systems to make UPW \u2014 some of the cleanest water in the world \u2014 but instead is used as makeup water for mechanical systems such as scrubbers and cooling towers, where water does not contact the wafer.\u201d\n\nGiven that an average of 76% of the water withdrawn by a fab is used for the manufacturing process, this means a significant amount of water used by fabs is still being drawn from local supplies.\n\n\u201c[What] they really haven't done yet is to take their industrial wastewater, clean it up and put it back into their ultrapure system to go around multiple times,\u201d said Westerhoff.\n\nNear-zero liquid discharge is a challenge that many water service service providers are helping to combat. Govindan said Gradiant achieved a 99% water recycling rate in one large $300 million water treatment facility for a semiconductor client, meaning that only 1% of the facility\u2019s water demand needed to be sourced from external freshwater supplies.\n\ntuk69tuk via Getty Images\n\nReducing pollution liability\n\nIn the long-term, Westerhoff expects that controlling facilities\u2019 wastewater streams could also be beneficial to \u201creducing long-term pollution liability\u201d and thinks manufacturers would be well served by purifying their wastewater to the highest level possible.\n\n\u201cAbout a decade ago, the semiconductor industry got an award from the EPA for phasing out one of these [PFAS] chemicals, and now the EPA regulates that chemical. So I think there\u2019s this secondary less-talked about benefit of treating your wastewater onsite. You reduce your liability, in the future, of contamination,\u201d he said.\n\nBy improving their purification processes, companies can also recover more valuable resources that can be used within the foundry, such as isopropyl alcohol and critical minerals.\n\n\u201cRecovering some of that copper really helps in terms of the economics of the water treatment,\u201d said Govindan. \u201cThe resource recovery really helps the circular economy, makes everything more sustainable and cheaper.\u201d\n\nBut the overarching challenge that manufacturers must address, according to experts, is reducing the amount of water that they procure from their local watershed.\n\nThe question of reducing water consumption is especially salient in places like TSMC\u2019s home country of Taiwan, because so much of the gross domestic product is tied up with the chip and high-end manufacturing industries and the \u201cwater sustainability of the country has shifted,\u201d said Govindan.\n\n\u201cThis might not happen at a national level for the U.S. or Germany, but locally, in states and cities, this definitely is a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless of their location, experts expect that fabs and their locales will need to think even more about water sustainability in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cAny of these companies that have complex supply chains are going to try to look towards their suppliers to help them reduce the water footprint of their products. That's really the next wave of this,\u201d said Westerhoff. \u201cEspecially if you want to be net water positive. You have to do something else in your supply chain or something else in your community.\u201d",

Chip manufacturing requires up to 10 million gallons of ultrapure water daily, crucial for wafer integrity and power efficiencies. This necessitates \"parts-per-quadrillon-level purity\" and presents major recycling challenges. Notably, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) increased its unit water consumption by 25.2% in 2023, missing its reduction target.\n\n**Why it matters:** Water sustainability is \"central to both success and survival\" for the semiconductor industry, impacting performance and wafer integrity.

There was a nearly two-month work stoppage last year due to about 33,000 Boeing employees of IAM District 751 and W24 striking at the company\u2019s commercial aircraft facilities in Washington, Oregon and California. The commercial plane strike significantly hurt Boeing\u2019s finances, contributing to an $11.8 billion loss in 2024.\n\nIf a strike occurs at its Missouri and Illinois facilities, the company will manage through it, since the numbers of employees there is significantly smaller than at its West Coast sites, Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a July 29 earnings call.\n\nComparatively, Boeing\u2019s defense, space and security business is also smaller than its commercial airplanes segment. Boeing\u2019s revenue for the first division was $6.6 billion in Q2 and $12.9 billion in H1, whereas Boeing\u2019s commercial division saw $10.9 billion in Q2 and $19 billion in the first half of 2025, according to an earnings release last week.\n\nStill, Boeing\u2019s BDS as well as its global services for the United States government will be disrupted, the company said in a recent second quarter securities filing. Additionally, the plane manufacturer stated that its financial position, as well as its operations and cash flow results, will be \u201cadversely impacted.\u201d\n\nBoeing also has major contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense. The agency awarded Boeing and Lockheed Martin a contract to develop a new fighter jet, the F-47, valued at $20 billion.\n\nThe last time IAM District 837 went on strike at the Missouri facilities was in 1996, lasting 99 days, when the site was operated under McDonnell Douglas, according to the union\u2019s May 2010 press release. The following year, McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing.",

The rejected proposal included a $5,000 bonus, which Boeing stated it would withdraw. These facilities assemble fighter jets, trainer aircraft, and unmanned refuelers under Boeing's defense segment. The strike follows the machinists' rejection of an initial contract proposal on July 27.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe strike will disrupt Boeing\u2019s defense, space and security business as well as its global services for the U.S. government. Boeing stated that its financial position, operations, and cash flow results will be \"adversely impacted.\" While Boeing's CEO previously commented on managing the strike due to smaller employee numbers than West Coast sites, the company's acknowledgment of adverse financial impact challenges any consensus that this strike is negligible.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis marks the second strike Boeing has experienced in less than a year.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAfter a pendulum swing toward shrinking the chemical footprint of packaging and other products, new government policies have prompted questions about what\u2019s in store for managing chemicals in the sector.\n\nPublic concern about the safety and sustainability of chemicals in packaging, and demand for products using safer alternatives, has prompted some companies to voluntarily eschew unnecessary chemicals or find different options. It\u2019s also spurred new regulatory efforts at the state, national and international levels over the past few years.\n\nSeveral states have adopted laws regulating chemicals in plastic packaging, including California, Maine, Minnesota and New York.\n\nMany are based on the Toxics in Packaging Clearinghouse\u2019s model legislation, which calls for reducing the use of four heavy metals \u2014 lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium \u2014 as well as PFAS and phthalates, for packaging or packaging-related materials sold or used within the state. The model legislation requires manufacturers and distributors to reduce levels of these \u201cincidentally introduced\u201d metals to 100 parts per million or less and to eliminate PFAS and phthalates.\n\nAt the federal level, while the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back some Biden-era PFAS regulations, it also has issued warnings about certain chemicals. With Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now helming the Department of Health and Human Services, the White House\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report cautioned of the impact of some substances on children\u2019s health.\n\nAt the international level, the UN Global Framework on Chemicals, whose implementation was discussed late last month in Uruguay, and a proposed global plastics treaty are adding to an increasingly complex policy landscape. In Europe, the EU adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, which will require companies to increase their use of sustainable packaging, part of the bloc\u2019s efforts to transition to a \u201ccircular and competitive\u201d economy for packaging.\n\nMixed signals\n\nAmid a recent corporate trend of adjusting, delaying or walking away from some ESG and packaging sustainability targets, some companies have also eased elective chemical footprint commitments.\n\nBut after years of corporate investment in reducing targeted chemicals or finding alternatives \u2014 and seeing the marketing advantages of doing so \u2014 some advocates are hopeful that companies won\u2019t completely abandon their chemical footprint reduction efforts. \u201cI think sustainability goes in cycles over time,\u201d said Angela Pinilla, senior program manager for the Chemical Footprint Project at Clean Production Action, which documents companies\u2019 efforts to reduce and disclose their chemical use.\n\nRecent analyses from nonprofits Clean Production Action and Toxic-Free Future found that the packaging industry has made progress in tracking and addressing PFAS, PVC and other chemicals in its products and raw materials.\n\nThe companies whose progress is highlighted in the Chemical Footprint Project\u2019s most recent report, including Walmart, Whole Foods and Clorox, provide examples of the benefits of taking a proactive, transparent approach, she said. Whole Foods, for instance, set a policy favoring safer chemicals in its supply chain and provides financial incentives for senior managers to reduce the use of chemicals of high concern.\n\nCompanies that completed the CFP survey reduced their collective use of chemicals of high concern by 132.9 million pounds, according to the report. \u201cThose frontrunners are showing it\u2019s possible to do it,\u201d Pinilla said.\n\nEarlier this year, many companies also urged the U.S. EPA to maintain its capacity to review and verify safer chemical formulations under the agency\u2019s Safer Choice certification program, which includes chemical and ingredient standards for products as well as their packaging.\n\nOne voluntary industry-led initiative is the U.S. Plastics Pact\u2019s Problematic and Unnecessary Materials List. By 2030, Pact participants aim to eliminate certain items that contain hazardous chemicals, are not reusable, recyclable or compostable, or can be replaced with alternatives.\n\nBut there is a limit to what the industry can reasonably do to decrease its chemical footprint, said Dan Felton, president and CEO of the Flexible Packaging Association.\n\nAttention to chemicals in packaging has shifted toward harder-to-address chemicals such as additives, whether intentionally or unintentionally included, he said. That push has largely come from environmental advocacy groups, he added.\n\n\u201cThere are some who just would wish that plastics didn't exist at all,\u201d Felton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, public pressure and the industry\u2019s homegrown initiatives have inspired tough new state rules that may be difficult to comply with, Felton said. \u201cYou have states taking that problematic materials list and sort of codifying it into proposed statutory requirements, which is different than what the Plastics Pact\u2019s focus is,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd some chemicals just can\u2019t be avoided or replaced with a better option right now, industry officials and some advocates say.\n\n\u201cFinding safer alternatives is challenging,\u201d Pinilla said. \u201cEspecially for higher performance packaging applications. Safer chemicals need to perform well as well.\u201d\n\nAn eye to the future\n\nExperts in the chemicals space have differing views on how the packaging industry is likely to chart a course on chemical management in the coming years. While some suspect chemical footprint commitments will continue to waver, others note that many companies recognize that the long-term trend toward safer chemicals will persist, particularly in light of state action.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council said in a statement that \u201cpromoting the safe use of the essential products of chemistry is a shared responsibility of manufacturers, the government and the public\u201d and that decisions at any level of government \u201cshould be made using a robust, objective, risk-based approach\u201d based on \u201csound science, data and facts.\u201d\n\nPackaging industry representatives say they are keeping a watchful eye on new policy developments at all levels of government.\n\n\u201cI think we're sort of waiting to see what kinds of restrictions are put in place, whether that be at the state level, the potential for federal consideration or what's happening in Europe and around the world,\u201d Felton said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJamie Sychak, a third generation employee at a steel manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania called Butler Works, was looking forward to his facility decarbonizing with a federal grant awarded in March 2024.\n\nThe plant where Sychak has worked for 30 years was one of two owned by steel manufacturing giant Cleveland-Cliffs. Together, they were granted up to $575 million from the Department of Energy between facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania to decarbonize production and push forward industry-wide plans for what environmental groups call \u201cgreen steel,\u201d or steel manufactured with lowered greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe most popular pathway for green steel involves electrifying the process with hydrogen created with renewable energy, also known as green hydrogen. The projects would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated one million tons annually by installing a hydrogen-ready blast furnace and two electric melting furnaces.\n\n\u201cOur workforce was incredibly happy to have this modernization of our facility,\u201d said Sychak, who\u2019s now president of United Automobile Workers Local 3303 after decades as a maintenance technician. \u201cIt\u2019s a step into the future and it makes us more secure in our jobs.\u201d\n\nWhile President Donald Trump pushes for increased domestic steel production, including approval for the $14 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese steelmaker Nippon in June, projects that could have reduced the industry\u2019s reliance on coal for electricity and steel production are now in doubt. The Trump administration has moved to cut grants awarded during the Biden administration and the shifting regulatory environment has led companies to rethink their plans.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs, for example, previously touted its role as the first steel producer to conduct hydrogen trials in the Americas but recently said it no longer plans to pursue a hydrogen project at its Middletown, Ohio, location.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to agree that we need to grow domestic manufacturing and we believe it\u2019s here that those investments need to happen,\u201d said Amanda Woodrum, co-director of Reimagine Appalachia, a coalition of nonprofits working to vitalize the region\u2019s economy through greener industries. \u201cGrowing those domestic industries like Cleveland-Cliffs that are already local should be a priority. It would be a travesty if those investments get undone.\u201d\n\nUpdating an old industry\n\nWhile the industrial world has progressed on the promise of steel production, the building materials used in skyscrapers, cars, and windmills come at a price: steel is the single largest industrial emitter on the planet, accounting for about 10% of global carbon annually, when including indirect electricity emissions from production.\n\nU.S. iron and steel demand is projected to rise 40% by 2050 percent, according to DOE. While the industry has moved toward adopting cleaner steel-making technology, emissions have continued to rise over the last decade. The global steel industry won\u2019t reach net zero emissions by mid-century unless it goes through a serious overhaul, according to a 2024 Breakthrough Report by the International Energy Agency.\n\nDOE\u2019s Industrial Demonstrations Program, meant to decarbonize high-polluting industries, awarded $1.5 billion across six projects last year in an effort to mitigate steel\u2019s environmental side effects. The bulk of that funding was awarded to Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 Butler Works in Butler County, Pennsylvania and Middletown Works in Butler County, Ohio, where Vice President J.D. Vance grew up.\n\nSychak\u2019s Butler Works plant was granted $75 million for an induction reheat furnace, an all-electric furnace that could replace the natural gas forced-air furnaces the plant currently uses. Along with lowering, if not eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, the electric furnace would provide more uniform, controlled heat that would produce a better steel product, Sychak said. He said no jobs would be lost and the new heating process can increase the yield in the steel by 4%.\n\n\u201cWe heard our grant was on the list for review, not necessarily to be cut,\u201d Sychak said in late June, who sent a letter of support for the grant to the Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with no news being good news.\u201d\n\nCleveland-Cliffs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company said during a May earnings call that part of its investments, including replacing a coal-fired blast furnace with a new unit running on hydrogen and natural gas at Middletown Works, could change \u201cto better align with the administration\u2019s energy priorities.\u201d In a July 21 earnings call, CEO Lourenco Goncalves confirmed the company \u201cinformed the DOE that we would not be pursuing that project\u201d because \u201cwe will not have availability of hydrogen.\u201d He said discussions were ongoing with the agency about rethinking the project to use fossil fuels such as coal.\n\nMeanwhile, the company announced in June that it had opened $150 million project at a Coshocton, Ohio, steel facility that replaces an acid-based system with a 100% hydrogen-based annealing line that can reduce emissions.\n\nThe company\u2019s change at Middletown reflects an overall flatlining of green steel projects in the U.S. While announcements for new near-zero steel projects more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, according to the 2023 IEA report, those projects did not increase by 2024. While about 10 million metric tons of near-zero emission projects remained in the global pipeline, more than 100 million metric tons were needed by 2030 to stay on a net zero pathway, according to the 2024 report.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hurdles to go through to make green steel,\u201d said Kathy Hipple, a research fellow who studies the advancement of green steel in Appalachia at the Ohio River Valley Institute, an economic research firm. \u201cThe cost of making green hydrogen is significantly higher than other forms of electricity so without a tax subsidy or incentive or some kind of support it\u2019s going to be very difficult. Even if companies are willing to pay a premium for green steel, it still isn\u2019t enough at the moment to justify the cost.\u201d\n\nCleveland-Cliffs recently confirmed it will not pursue a hydrogen furnace project in Middletown, Ohio, and is instead talking to the U.S. Department of Energy about fossil-based options. Courtesy of Cleveland-Cliffs\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAppalachia\u2019s Ohio River Valley has historically been the epicenter of the U.S. coal and steel industries. Green steel could boost production in the region, according to researchers, while lowering negative health impacts and high carbon emissions that have increased the frequency and severity of some natural disasters under climate change.\n\nPollution from steel production can lead to increases in particulate matter and ozone, both of which can cause shortness of breath, respiratory infections and worsen asthma conditions. Particulate matter can lodge in the bloodstream, decreasing lung function or causing premature death for people with heart or lung disease, according to the U.S. EPA.\n\nButler County, Ohio, where the Middletown plants are located, received an F grade for ozone and particulate matter in the air in the American Lung Associations 2025 State of the Air report. Butler County, Pennsylvania, where Butler Works is located, was not part of the 2025 analysis because data was not available.\n\nIn its 2024 sustainability report, Cleveland-Cliffs reported 15,499 metric tons of particulate matter emissions across all of its operations. The company stated that it had lower a GHG emissions intensity than the global average of integrated steel mills, and lower than the averages in Europe and China. Specific emissions for the U.S. were not included in the chart for comparison. The company has a long-term goal to reduce its GHG emissions to \u201cnear net zero\u201d by 2050, with interim targets along the way.\n\nNippon Steel also has a goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But its recent acquisition of U.S. Steel means those goals now have to align with the Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels. The transaction includes a \u201cgolden share\u201d that gives the U.S. government more control over the future of the company, including the ability to appoint one independent director and grant the president or a designee consent rights over reductions in capital investments, and moving or closing facilities.\n\nPrior to the sale, U.S. Steel was moving ahead with projects to lower or eliminate carbon emissions. A partnership between U.S. Steel, Molten Industries, and CFPD Software aimed to build a pilot project to eliminate carbon emissions from iron production by using hydrogen.\n\n\u201cSome of the hopes for green steel adoption have dimmed under the Trump administration,\u201d Hipple said, while noting other economic powerhouses like China and Europe haven\u2019t stopped. \u201cThe world will move forward. Do you want to be focused on industries that will ultimately be part of the future or on industries that look backward?\u201d",

        "summary_text": "As the price of Super Bowl ads rises \u2014 with 30-second spots reportedly going for more than $8 million earlier this year \u2014 brands continue to find new ways to tap into attention around the big game without paying to be in it, including by focusing on the post-game Monday.\n\nFast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. this year iterated on a Free Burger Day concept from 2024 by offering free Hangover Burgers on a day it rechristened National Hangover Day. Key to Carl\u2019s Jr.\u2019s Super Bowl-adjacent campaign was social media star Alix Earle, who starred in a spot that nodded to the racy ads the chain was known for in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nThe partnership was one of the top-performing campaigns that ran in the days leading up to the Super Bowl, with an Instagram post that notched a 47% engagement rate and helped the brand secure a 91% increase in followers, per Metricool social data shared with Marketing Dive.\n\n\u201cWe didn't have a spot in the Super Bowl, but we had so much buzz on social media, between the free giveaway and the campaign itself,\u201d said Kara Gasbarro, vice president of creative strategy at Carl\u2019s Jr. parent CKE Restaurants. \u201cIt was a nice fit for us to reintroduce Carl's Jr. to a younger audience.\u201d\n\nCarl\u2019s Jr. turned a Los Angeles location into a one-night-only after-hours party. Courtesy of Carl's Jr.\n\nCarl\u2019s Jr. has worked to build on the success of the National Hangover Day campaign by iterating on its partnership with Earle, an influencer with 7.5 million TikTok followers who has also linked with brands like Poppi, Pantene and Hawaiian Tropic for a series of efforts. Beyond her reach and increased profile, Earle presented an opportunity for the chain to pair with an ambassador as bold and audacious as its menu offerings.\n\n\u201cWe met Alix where she was, as far as being authentic,\u201d Gasbarro said. \u201cThat was really important to us with audiences, especially a very social-forward, young audience \u2026 you want the content to feel fun and buzz-worthy, but you want it to feel real\u2026 what she would say, and how she would say it.\u201d\n\nCheesy nostalgia\n\nThe chain in May hosted Club Carl's, turning a Los Angeles location into a one-night-only after-hours party (an opportunity for the brand to capture content) featuring Earle, a DJ and a chance to craft a personalized Build Your Own Bag value offering. Earlier this month, Carl\u2019s Jr. teamed with Earle again as part of a \u201cKay So?\u201d campaign that promotes a Queso Crunch Burger that features cheese sauce and tortilla strips.\n\nIn the spot, Earle enjoys a night at a club where everything she sees \u2014 from shot glasses, to going-out tops, to lip gloss \u2014 is made of queso. Eventually, Earle heads to a drive-thru to satisfy her craving, and as she takes a bite of the burger, Paris Hilton pulls up in a Bentley and updates her signature catchphrase to match the campaign\u2019s play on words: \u201cKay, so that\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\nAdding Hilton to the mix allowed Carl\u2019s Jr. to tap into nostalgia, a ubiquitous part of cultural marketing for the past few years. Hilton starred in an infamous 2005 ad that was typical of the chain\u2019s advertising, which can be best summarized as blondes in bikinis eating burgers. Earle\u2019s efforts for the brand have shared that tone, which Carl\u2019s Jr. had not set out to mimic.\n\n\u201cFrom a strategy perspective, it really was trying to find that authentic fit versus going back and recreate what we did before,\u201d Gasbarro said. \u201cI don't think it was intentional\u2026 this is what an audience today would react to.\u201d\n\nWhile Earle and Hilton have featured in traditional TV ads for the brand, Carl\u2019s Jr. has worked to extend the campaigns in other paid and owned channels, as well as those of their brand ambassadors. Like other fast-food and QSR chains, loyalty is also a key part of its multichannel strategy; customers using the chain\u2019s app unlock more options for the Build Your Own Bag offering.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to something like a loyalty platform, how can we make it unique and different and reward that behavior?\u201d Gasbarro said. \u201cHow can we grow those platforms to make them more interesting and unique for the consumers?\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Carl's Jr. ditches costly Super Bowl ads for influencer-led social buzz.\n\n**Key details:** Carl's Jr. launched \"Super Bowl-adjacent\" campaigns, including a \"National Hangover Day\" promotion featuring social media star Alix Earle. This initiative generated significant social media buzz, avoiding the high cost of traditional Super Bowl ad spots. The chain also collaborated with Earle for a \"Club Carl's\" event and a \"Kay So?\" campaign, which additionally featured Paris Hilton. These efforts aim to reintroduce Carl's Jr. to a younger audience.\n\n**Why it matters:** Carl's Jr. achieved substantial social media engagement and follower growth without purchasing a Super Bowl ad, reportedly costing over $8 million. This directly challenges the consensus view that expensive, prime-time advertising is essential for major event attention. The strategy demonstrates that brands can effectively reach new demographics and generate buzz through targeted influencer partnerships and social media campaigns, offering a more cost-effective alternative to traditional advertising.\n\n**The big picture:** Brands are increasingly seeking alternative methods to capture attention around major events as traditional advertising costs escalate. Carl's Jr. is leveraging social media influencers like Alix Earle and nostalgic appeals with Paris Hilton to engage a new, younger consumer base. This approach prioritizes authenticity and buzz-worthy content, extending campaigns across multichannel strategies, including loyalty platforms.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Super Bowl ad 30-second spots: reportedly >$8 million\n*   Carl's Jr. Instagram post engagement rate (National Hangover Day campaign): 47%\n*   Carl's Jr. brand follower increase (related to campaign): 91%\n*   Alix Earle's TikTok followers: 7.5 million\n*   Paris Hilton's infamous Carl's Jr. ad year: 2005\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Carl's Jr.:** Fast-food chain that shifted its marketing focus from traditional Super Bowl ads to influencer-led social campaigns.\n*   **CKE Restaurants:** Parent company of Carl's Jr., overseeing the new marketing strategy and brand partnerships.\n*   **Alix Earle:** Social media star and influencer prominently featured in Carl's Jr.'s successful Super Bowl-adjacent and \"Kay So?\" campaigns.\n*   **Paris Hilton:** Starred in a 2005 Carl's Jr. ad and recently joined Alix Earle in the \"Kay So?\" campaign to tap into nostalgia.\n*   **Metricool:** Social data provider that reported the high engagement rates of Carl's Jr.'s recent marketing efforts.\n*   **Kara Gasbarro:** Vice president of creative strategy at CKE Restaurants, who provided insights on the new marketing approach.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Carl's Jr. proves influencer marketing can beat costly Super Bowl ads.",

        "summary_text": "Kellanova has teamed with the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) to become the Official Snack of U.S. Soccer, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The partnership is Kellanova North America\u2019s first partnership in sports for its entire snack portfolio, which includes Pringles, Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts, and comes as the company has more than doubled its sports marketing spend since 2018.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest in sports because we see the value it brings \u2014 not only in growing fan engagement and cultural relevance, but also in delivering strong returns on our brand-building efforts,\u201d said Julie Bowerman, chief marketing officer of Kellanova North America, in a statement.\n\nThe partnership comes as the U.S. prepares to host the 2026 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup, as well as the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Soccer fandom has exploded, with first-time fans up more than 400% year-over-year, and it is a \u201ctransformative\u201d time for the sport, said Dan Gaiman, senior vice president of partnership development and strategy at the USSF.\n\n\u201cWe're really focused on finding those brands that are as excited as we are about this moment ahead, and really want to lean in,\u201d Gaiman said. \u201cFrom the shelves to the stadiums, Kellanova can create these joyful moments that connect our fans with the game.\u201d\n\nBrand halo\n\nThe partnership, with the shared tagline \u201cIt Takes a Pack,\u201d will see Kellanova\u2019s brands appear in national advertising, digital and social content and assets feature the company\u2019s brand mascots. The effort also includes retail activations, packaging, in-store displays and purpose-driven events.\n\n\u201cNext year is going to be one of the biggest cultural moments that we're going to see, and it's all around soccer,\u201d said Maggie Gilliam Hoy, senior director of omni capabilities and center of excellence lead at Kellanova. \u201cThere are a lot of dimensions in our partnership that we're going to bring to light.\u201d\n\nThe USSF is the nonprofit governing body of American soccer at international, professional and amateur levels, including the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams, Major League Soccer, the National Women's Soccer League, youth organizations and beyond. Finding the right brand partners for the organization requires an alignment of values.\n\n\u201cBrand halo is really important. We want to work with brands that have a strong national presence [that] can help lift up the sport during such an important time and a commitment to really activating and engaging with our fans,\u201d Gaiman explained.\n\nA fraught playing field\n\nKellanova is the snack-focused business created when the Kellogg Company split off its North American cereal business as WK Kellogg Co in October 2023. Kellanova net sales were approximately $13 billion in 2024, per details from the company. Food giant Mars has made a $36 billion bid to acquire Kellanova but has hit regulatory snags in the EU.\n\nWith or without another corporate restructuring, Kellanova faces a CPG space dealing with changing consumer tastes, tariff-related issues and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amid all of that, the partnership around soccer requires lots of work to build out and activate.\n\n\u201cWe're just staying focused and true to what we're really good at, which is having super strong brands and bringing them to life and working with our retail partners,\u201d Gilliam Hoy said. \u201cWe're sticking to business as usual and driving strong business with our retail partners.\u201d\n\nThe partnership also comes at a time of heightened sensitivity around sociopolitical issues for brands that are sometimes exacerbated by input by President Trump (e.g. American Eagle\u2019s ongoing controversy around a campaign with Sydney Sweeney). The administration\u2019s travel bans and immigration crackdown have raised concerns about the fitness of the U.S. to host international sporting events, including the World Cup and the Olympics \u2014 controversy Kellanova would surely like to avoid.\n\n\u201cThe retail moment and tentpole moment that we're talking about [is bigger than World Cup],\u201d Gilliam Hoy said. \u201cWe're trying to get into that emotional, cultural side that everybody has. Everybody has an experience with soccer.\u201d",

The brand\u2019s first retail concept will open in Raleigh, North Carolina, in October.\n\nMaeve currently has dedicated retail space within Anthropologie\u2019s stores and has become the top-searched brand on Anthropologie\u2019s website over the past year. Its product assortment \u201cblends timeless silhouettes with modern details,\u201d features plus, petite, tall and adaptive options, and targets a \u201cmultigenerational audience,\u201d according to Anthropologie.\n\nTo kick off the launch, Anthropologie is rolling out a robust marketing strategy. This includes an ad campaign across digital and physical channels, a Maeve catalog that will be shipped to top customers, a Substack newsletter, and an in-person event in New York City featuring a mock store preview and product unveilings.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs an owned brand, Maeve became a growth driver and developed a loyal customer base, which sowed the seeds for this transition, according to Anthropologie. Over the past year, almost 2 million customers have shopped Maeve products and the brand has accumulated more than 10 million TikTok views, per the release.\n\n\u201cIts consistent performance, combined with our customers\u2019 emotional connection to the brand, made this the right moment to evolve Maeve into a stand-alone identity,\u201d Anu Narayanan, president of women\u2019s and home at Anthropologie Group, said in a statement. \u201cOur customers have helped shape Maeve into what it is today and shown us time and again that the label holds a special place in both their wardrobes and their lives.\u201d\n\nPrior to introducing Maeve as a stand-alone brand, Anthropologie has expanded in other ways. In January, the retailer unveiled resortwear line Celandine, complete with swimwear, cover-ups, dresses, accessories and beauty products. Two months later, Anthropologie partnered with Universal Standard to create a 13-piece collection, including shirts, jeans, a jumpsuit and dresses.\n\nThose efforts are paying off, according to Frank Conforti, COO and co-president of parent company Urban Outfitters Inc. On an earnings call with analysts in May, Conforti noted that both brick-and-mortar and digital channels drove growth for Anthropologie and praised the segment\u2019s product assortment.\n\n\u201cThe team at Anthropologie continues to do an excellent job with their strategy to expand their product offerings to fit their customers\u2019 full lifestyle,\u201d Conforti said, adding that the launch of Celandine had already \u201cexceeded our expectations. Alongside Celandine, Daily Practice and the expanded assortment of intimates and loungewear are also seeing impressive growth, and we believe these could become significant categories in the future.\u201d\n\nAnthropologie\u2019s net sales in the quarter rose 8.3% year over year, with comparable sales up 6.9%. Urban Outfitters Inc. reported a 10.7% jump in net sales for the quarter, to $1.3 billion.",

Available Aug. 12, the McDonaldland Meal features a special shake and collectible souvenirs.\n\nPublicis, Wieden+Kennedy, TMS, ProdCo, We Are Social, IMG and IMS collaborated on different elements of the campaign, which again sees the chain tapping into nostalgia for its brand to drive engagement and sales.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is making one of its most expansive plays around nostalgia with the return of McDonaldland, the brand\u2019s erstwhile advertising staple that includes brand characters Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Birdie, Hamburglar, Mayor McCheese and the Fry Friends. The last few years have seen the chain utilize specific brand characters in its marketing.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years we've seen how fans flock to our characters, everyone from Grimace to the Hamburglar. But many, especially the new generation, don't know that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's an entire magical world of McDonaldland filled with characters, places and lore,\u201d said Jennifer \u201cJJ\u201d Healan, the brand\u2019s vice president of U.S. marketing, brand, content and culture, in the press release.\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s has utilized Hamburglar, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey and Grimace (the latter of whom starred in what became a viral, sales-driving campaign), the new effort is the first time the entire crew of brand characters appears in the chain\u2019s marketing, including in a psychedelic commercial soundtracked by Toro y Moi that reimagines an ad from 1971.\n\nThe McDonaldland meal features a Quarter Pounder with Cheese or a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets along with fries, a Mt. McDonaldland Shake with a surprise flavor and a collectible souvenir that press materials say will \u201cunlock core memories.\u201d\n\nAs with its other nostalgia-fueled campaigns, the McDonaldland effort spans traditional, digital and retail channels. The brand will bring McDonaldland to life at ThriftCon, Breakaway Music Festival, Watkin\u2019s Glen International and the Daytona 500, tapping into consumer interest around fashion, music and sports. Digitally, McDonaldland will appear in Fortnite and a Snapchat AR experience that includes games, filters, lenses and a 3D map.\n\nIn addition, McDonald\u2019s has teamed with Pacsun on a clothing collection that includes t-shirts, hoodies, bucket hats, claw clips and more, and with Away on a collection of travel accessories including luggage tags and bag charms.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s recently utilized nostalgia in the campaign around its returning Snack Wraps menu item, which has ignited a new stage in the so-called chicken wars among QSR chains.\n\nThe McDonaldland campaign comes as the chain struggles amid continued consumer uncertainty.

The broad nature of this campaign suggests McDonald's is deploying a major strategy to reverse recent negative sales trends and challenge the perception of ongoing struggles.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMcDonaldland, a fantasy world from McDonald's marketing, debuted in 1971 but has been absent for over two decades. While specific characters like Grimace and Hamburglar have recently appeared, this campaign marks the first time the entire crew returns. The brand aims to leverage fan engagement with characters and introduce the full McDonaldland lore to a new generation. This follows other recent nostalgia-fueled campaigns, including the return of Snack Wraps, which impacted the \"chicken wars.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **1971:** McDonaldland fantasy world debuted in an ad.\n*   **20+ years:** How long McDonaldland has been absent from marketing.\n*   **August 12:** Date the McDonaldland Meal becomes available.\n*   **3.6%:** Decrease in McDonald's U.S. comparable sales in Q1 2025.\n*   **August 6:** Date for Q2 2025 earnings announcement.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **McDonald\u2019s:** The company launching an expansive McDonaldland campaign to boost sales and engagement.\n*   **Publicis:** One of several collaborators on different elements of the McDonaldland campaign.\n*   **Wieden+Kennedy:** Agency that collaborated on various elements of McDonald's new campaign.\n*   **TMS:** One of the agencies that collaborated on the McDonaldland campaign elements.\n*   **ProdCo:** Collaborated on different elements of McDonald's new McDonaldland marketing campaign.\n*   **We Are Social:** One of the agencies collaborating on various aspects of the McDonaldland campaign.\n*   **IMG:** Collaborated on different elements of the new McDonaldland multichannel campaign.\n*   **IMS:** Agency collaborating on various aspects of McDonald's expansive McDonaldland campaign.\n*   **Ronald McDonald:** A classic McDonaldland character returning as part of the new marketing effort.\n*   **Grimace:** McDonaldland character returning; previously starred in a viral, sales-driving campaign.\n*   **Birdie:** McDonaldland brand character featured in the new McDonald's marketing campaign.\n*   **Hamburglar:** McDonaldland character featured in new marketing; previously utilized by the chain.\n*   **Mayor McCheese:** A McDonaldland brand character appearing in the new integrated marketing campaign.\n*   **Fry Friends:** McDonaldland brand characters featured as part of the new extensive campaign.\n*   **Jennifer \u201cJJ\u201d Healan:** McDonald\u2019s VP of U.S. marketing, commented on character appeal to fans.\n*   **Toro y Moi:** Artist who soundtracked the psychedelic commercial for the new campaign.\n*   **Uncle O\u2019Grimacey:** Specific brand character that McDonald's has utilized in previous marketing efforts.\n*   **Pacsun:** Partnered with McDonald's for a clothing collection tied to the McDonaldland campaign.\n*   **Away:** Collaborated with McDonald's on a travel accessories collection for the campaign.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   McDonald's Q2 2025 earnings announcement on August 6.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMcDonald's bets big on nostalgia to reverse sales decline.",

        "summary_text": "The Kroger Company has been in the grocery business since 1883, and for the past several decades, has increased its footprint by merging with chains that have equally deep roots, including King Soopers, Fry\u2019s, Fred Meyer and Ralphs. To bring the family of brands closer together, Kroger in 2021 unveiled an enterprise logo, the citrus-inspired \u201cFresh Cart,\u201d that spans its brands.\n\nVisuals are only one part of Kroger\u2019s brand experience, especially in a grocery category where touch, taste and smell are equally potent. And earlier this year, the company added the fifth sense to its toolbox with a new sonic ecosystem that is now part of its external and internal brand experience.\n\n\u201cWe wanted [the sonic logo] to be more than just an advertising jingle \u2014 that was never the spirit. We wanted for it to act as a cue to the customer experience. We always intended from the beginning that we were going to use this in many different ways, beyond just traditional paid advertising,\u201d said Tom Duncan, the vice president and head of marketing at Kroger.\n\nKroger\u2019s sonic logo, a sunny, jazz-inspired melody, was designed to be emotionally warm while also distinctive and flexible, Duncan explained. As the Fresh Cart appears in paid advertising, owned channels and retail touchpoints, Kroger\u2019s new sonic identity will be deployed across multichannel advertising, retail environments, hold music, events and internal communications.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of research and science that shows that the more senses that you can engage, the better recall, attribution and emotional impact that you have in your experiences, both advertising and otherwise,\u201d the executive said.\n\nMaking the brand\n\nThe company responsible for taking that research and science and turning it into a sonic ecosystem for Kroger was Made Music Studio, a company founded in 1995. Despite all those years in the space, Made Music executives are still surprised when marketers don\u2019t understand the nuance of sonic branding.\n\n\u201cIt's surprising to some folks, that it's not just those little mnemonics that you hear at the end of a commercial or a jingle \u2014 it's actually a sonic system that we craft very strategically,\u201d said John Taite, executive vice president of global brand partnerships and development at Made Music. \u201cIt really has to make people feel a particular thing about a brand, product or experience.\u201d\n\nWhen crafting a sonic ecosystem, Made Music staff attempt to be \u201cmusical detectives\u201d or \u201cmusical method actors,\u201d considering what the brand means to consumers, its impact on culture, and how sound complements its visual branding. The studio keyed in on the idea of a brand with one foot in the past but one foot in the future that leans on history but has a modern place in consumers\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe instant feeling that you get [from the sonic logo] is something that's fresh, friendly, relatable. There's an inherent playfulness in it. it's very upbeat, it's got modern instrumentation in it. There's a hint of history with a little bit of jazz,\u201d Taite explained, noting that the riff also includes a musical blue note in a nod to Kroger\u2019s iconic brand color.\n\n\u201cWe try to get a sense of the brand essence, what it means to them. What is that brand truth, that unique feeling that sets it apart in their minds and in the minds of consumers? We're always trying to get to that point where we're uncovering the inevitable sound of a brand \u2014 a sound that just really couldn't sound like anybody else,\u201d the executive added.\n\nLike everything else developed and deployed by marketers, sonic branding must help a brand reach its goals and KPIs. Made Music worked with researchers at Sentient Decision Science and discovered that Kroger\u2019s sonic identity tested as one of the best the studio has ever tested with the firm. That finding gives Kroger and Made Music confidence as the sonic identity is rolled out in advertising and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe more you hear it, the more you'll love it, the more it will feel like it's always been in the market,\u201d Taite said. \u201cEvery piece of sound that somebody interacts with leaves an impression, whether it's intentional or not. Modern brands need to be prepared to meet those hard-to-reach audiences, certainly Gen Z customers, when they're consuming content.\u201d",

The stories are available for download on Wattpad, a site where users can independently publish works for public consumption.\n\nThe activation takes advantage of the #steamybooktok\u201d trend, which has garnered over 4.7 billion views, according to press materials. The \u201cBank Your Glow\u201d short stories take advantage of the growing popularity of romance novels and the online community fueling their popularity.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNeutrogena is leaning into sex appeal with its newest activation. Kerrigan, who has built her online presence around self-confidence, provides the campaign a sense of self-assured humor. Additionally, Kerrigan claims the short stories are based on her real life experiences, something her over 608,000 TikTok followers may find intriguing.\n\nIn one story \u2014 which Kerrigan partially reenacts on TikTok \u2014 a character is locked outside an apartment, half-clothed after a one-night stand. In the second, a woman bumps into her college crush during a weekend in the Hamptons. Both stories emphasize the \u201cglow\u201d each character feels afterward in a nod to the product\u2019s benefits.\n\nNeutrogena has tapped into TikTok trends in the past. In June, the brand turned to nostalgia with a campaign inspired by \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d and other \u201890s artifacts to connect with millennials.\n\nThe campaign leans into sexually suggestive advertising, an age-old tactic that is currently seeing a resurgence, albeit with mixed results. American Eagle is currently embroiled in a scandal surrounding an ad featuring Sydney Sweeney, while Hawaiian Tropic nodded to the \u201cKama Sutra\u201d with internet star Alix Earle and Doritos parodied retro adult films with Walton Goggins without the controversy.\n\nBrands have been embracing romance novels for years, especially as print sales of such books have more than doubled between 2020 and 2023. Smoothie King released a novel written with the help of ChatGPT about a watermelon smoothie in May. Way back in 2018, Wendy\u2019s used Wattpad to publish romance novels.\n\nKenvue, Neutrogena\u2019s parent company, had a Q1 revenue of $3.74 billion, a nearly 4% year-over-year dip, according to an earnings call. However, Neutrogena was a bright spot, with household penetration among Gen Z consumers growing 30 basis points. This was largely attributed to the launch of its \u201cBeauty to a Science\u201d brand positioning in Febuary, which generated significant social media buzz.",

Plus, the elimination game features a beheading animation in line with Liquid Death\u2019s grim style.\n\nThat style is on display in an online spot that shows three fantasy players who have their necks in guillotines while watching football at a sports bar. Two beheadings happen off-screen, although some blood splashes on a can of Liquid Death and a smartphone with Yahoo branding.\n\nLiquid Death this year has remained active with the type of earned media-spurring marketing stunts with which it has built its brand. The brand teamed with a then-pregnant Kylie Kelce to sell Liquid Death Mini Kegs, took on prebiotic soda with a \u201ctoilet taste test,\u201d and sold Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s DNA (a month before the musical icon\u2019s death).

This season marks the first time Yahoo Sports will offer guillotine league functionality.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis collaboration brings Liquid Death into the popular fantasy football world. It is billed as a way for Yahoo to engage its millions of fantasy users and attract the next generation of fans. Yahoo, an industry leader since 1999, has faced changes in sports gambling and competition from betting platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. This unique, edgy league format could challenge the consensus by differentiating Yahoo's offering in a competitive market.\n\n**The big picture:**\nYahoo staked out a leading position in fantasy football in 1999 and has remained an industry leader. Liquid Death is a canned water brand known for its edgy marketing, heavy metal branding, and \"murder your thirst\" tagline. The company has built its brand with earned media-spurring marketing stunts and ran its first national Super Bowl spot this year. Fantasy football boasts tens of millions of players in the U.S., providing a large market for this new venture.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   1999: Year Yahoo staked out a leading position in fantasy football.\n*   Tens of millions: Number of fantasy football players in the U.S.\n*   28th: Year of Yahoo Fantasy Football this season.\n*   28 Days of Fantasy: Name of Yahoo Sports' campaign introducing new features daily.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Yahoo Sports:** Will launch fantasy football guillotine leagues in collaboration with Liquid Death.\n*   **Liquid Death:** Canned water brand partnering with Yahoo Sports for its new guillotine league functionality.\n*   **Ryan Spoon:** President of Yahoo Media Group, expressed excitement about blending innovation and creativity.\n*   **DraftKings:** Betting platform mentioned as a competitor to Yahoo in the sports gambling space.\n*   **FanDuel:** Betting platform noted as competition for Yahoo in the sports gambling space.\n*   **Kylie Kelce:** Teamed with Liquid Death to sell Mini Kegs while she was pregnant.\n*   **Ozzy Osbourne:** Musical icon whose DNA was sold by Liquid Death a month before his death.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Yahoo Sports will roll out a new feature daily as part of its \"28 Days of Fantasy\" campaign.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nYahoo and Liquid Death team up for edgy fantasy football to attract new users.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is embracing grit and humor with a new multi-season ad campaign that arrives nearly a year after the outdoor apparel maker revamped its marketing leadership and agency roster, per news shared with Marketing Dive.\n\n\u201cEngineered for Whatever,\u201d part of Columbia\u2019s first brand platform relaunch in a decade, leverages dark humor to demonstrate the durability of its gear. The titular 30-second spot begins with a hiker stopping to smell the flowers before getting jumped by a snake, setting the tone for the narrative that shows people in peril.\n\nColumbia also enlisted real stunt performers to put its goods to the test in hairy situations, such as dangling above predator-infested waters. Beyond the video ads, the company is refreshing its visual identity with a new typeface, logo lockup, color palette and touch-ups for other assets appearing across retail, social and digital channels.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nColumbia is taking notes from \u201cJackass\u201d and \u201c127 Hours\u201d with a campaign that mixes laughs with a tough-as-nails attitude. The revamped messaging and visual identity follow the brand appointing new marketing leadership in October, with Matthew Sutton joining the outdoor company as head of marketing. Around the same the time, Columbia named Adam&eveDDB as its global agency of record following a competitive review.\n\n\u201cEngineered for Whatever\u201d aims to position 87-year-old Columbia as a disruptor in a category that tends to portray the great outdoors as \u201cpristine and perfect,\u201d executives said. The brand had seen a sales recovery in recent quarters after a period of flagging consumer demand but is now grappling with the impact of tariffs. One of its goals has been to bring product strategy and marketing closer together to raise awareness for proprietary technology innovations like its Omni-Heat, Omni-Max, Omni-Shade and Omni-Freeze offerings.\n\nThe new campaign puts that mandate into action with ads depicting heightened versions of the intense testing Columbia goods undergo. Those trials include: being chased by desert vultures and the literal Grim Reaper; enduring temperatures so cold they crack teeth; and face-planting in the mud on a trail run. A thrash metal cover of the usually dreamy \u201cBlue Skies\u201d serves as the soundtrack.\n\n\u201cSome people think nature is like this,\u201d an opening narration says over footage of a hiker stopping to appreciate the flowers on an idyllic trail. \u201cIt\u2019s actually like this,\u201d the narrator continues as a snake suddenly shoots out from the brush to bite the hiker.\n\nThe commercial features an appearance by mountaineer Aron Ralston, who again finds himself trapped between a canyon and a falling boulder, a situation that led him to cut off part of his right arm in 2003. The harrowing predicament inspired his autobiography, \u201cBetween a Rock and a Hard Place,\u201d which was later adapted into the feature film \u201c127 Hours.\u201d Henry-Alex Rubin directed \u201cEngineered for Whatever,\u201d with production by Smuggler.\n\n\u201cBy embracing the real and unexpected sides of adventure we\u2019re staying true to our legacy and breaking away from the sea of sameness in our industry,\u201d said Columbia marketing head Sutton in a statement.\n\nA separate video, releasing later in August, shows off the durability of Columbia\u2019s ROC pants by having a stunt performer dangle over waters teeming with alligators, his lifeline to a helicopter made up of multiple pairs of the pants tied together. Future stunt-oriented creative will show people strapped to a snowplow to promote Columbia\u2019s Omni-Heat Infinity technology and tumbling down a mountain slope in a snowball while keeping warm with the brand\u2019s puffer jackets.\n\nIn addition, Columbia is running out-of-home ads that carry the same throughline of punchy humor. Social, display, audio and connected TV elements round out the media plan.\n\nColumbia Sportswear's sales increased 6% in the second quarter, the company announced last week. However, sales were down 2% in the U.S., which was offset by growth in international markets. The company expects tariffs to put pressure on sales going forward.",

        "summary_text": "Domino\u2019s today (Aug. 4) launched a new campaign for its long-standing $6.99 Mix & Match deal, per details shared with Marketing Dive. Creative visualizes how pizzas stack up to similarly priced cheeseburgers by cutting the latter into comically small portions in an attempt to grab the attention of consumers who still think fast-food burger chains provide the best value.\n\nThe effort was created with agency partner WorkInProgress and demonstrates how Domino\u2019s is taking the fight over QSR value to fast-food chains. Two 30-second spots featuring real people bring that insight to life for kids at a bounce park and for practicing football players; the campaign also includes a 15-second product-focused ad. Creative will run across TV, linear, social and digital.\n\n\u201cEvery QSR brand and fast casual is trying to find their way into value, and I think they are realizing they need to apply more creative firepower to that, because it's so crucial right now,\u201d said Matt Talbot, co-founder and chief creative officer at WorkInProgress. \u201cWe talk a lot about value being not cheap, but being the best food for a good price\u2026 I think our position was less about targeting a specific brand, and more the categories or food types, just to make people think about it in a new way.\u201d\n\nThe value-focused push comes as the macroeconomic landscape remains unsettled by the effects of tariffs, inflation and other issues. QSR brands, especially fast-food chains that have long relied on low prices as a key part of their value propositions, have struggled to deliver on value as they previously had. The market has forced restaurants to turn to new marketing strategies, with chains including Chili\u2019s advertising about providing more value than fast food.\n\n\u201cOur approach to advertising is to combine a memorable brand action, craveable pizza and strong and consistent value. This combination allows for more breakthrough work that is also very attractive to customers [and] helps us break out of the sea of sameness you start to feel in the QSR space,\u201d said Kate Trumbull, executive vice president and global chief marketing officer at Domino\u2019s, in emailed comments.\n\nWhile Chili\u2019s illustrated the high cost of fast food with a high-concept pop-up, Domino\u2019s is using an effective visual metaphor that was first conceptualized by Domino\u2019s CEO Russell Weiner before being expanded upon by WorkInProgress. The creative process on the campaign illustrates the collaborative approach between brand and agency that has yielded other successful efforts, like its Emergency Pizza platform.\n\n\u201cThere's not any barrier between Domino\u2019s and us, as far as the way ideas flow back and forth, because we have such a tight relationship and we have a seat at the table,\u201d Talbot explained. \u201cWe know what's going on with the business, and we know what are the levers we can pull.\u201d\n\nThe focus on the $6.99 Mix & Match deal demonstrates how Domino\u2019s is finding new messages around old offers, especially with its previous \u201cBest Deal Ever\u201d promotion set to end on Aug. 3. The effort is backed by internal research that found consumers still view fast-food burger chains as having the best value, despite the reality in 2025.\n\n\u201cThis deal has existed for a very long time and is very popular with existing customers, but isn't used commonly by new customers,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cWe've never illustrated the value in this super clear way.\u201d\n\nDomino\u2019s last quarter saw U.S. same-store sales growth of 3.4%, per an earnings report. Executives on a call with investors discussed how having the largest ad budget within the pizza QSR gives the chain the ability to out-advertise the competition, especially in an environment where all of QSR faces headwinds.\n\n\u201cI think the important thing to understand right now is whether it's pizza or burgers or QSRs in general. There is pressure because consumers are looking for value,\u201d CEO Russell Weiner said on the call. \u201cThe big difference with Domino's is when we provide value, we're going on offense. We're doing it because we think we can grow, and I think other folks are doing it because they're on defense and a little bit treading water.\u201d",

The campaign visually compares pizzas to comically small fast-food burger portions to highlight value. It aims to grab the attention of consumers who still believe fast-food burger chains offer the best value. The effort was created with agency partner WorkInProgress and includes TV, social, and digital ads. This push demonstrates Domino's taking the QSR value fight directly to fast-food chains.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis campaign signifies Domino's proactive \"offense\" in the QSR value battle, contrasting with competitors \"on defense.\" It directly addresses internal research showing consumers still view fast-food burger chains as providing the best value, despite \"reality in 2025.\" The strategy aims to attract new customers to a long-standing deal not commonly used by them. This aggressive marketing challenge to the fast-food burger category's perceived value could shift consumer expectations across the QSR industry. The approach suggests Domino's believes it can grow through value marketing while others are merely \"treading water.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe value-focused push comes as the macroeconomic landscape remains unsettled by tariffs, inflation, and other issues. QSR brands, particularly fast-food chains, have struggled to deliver on their traditional low-price value propositions. The market has forced restaurants to turn to new marketing strategies, with chains like Chili\u2019s also advertising about value.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has moved to block Edwards Lifesciences\u2019 planned acquisition of JenaValve Technology, citing concerns that the deal threatens to reduce competition in the market for devices to treat aortic regurgitation.\n\nThe agency alleged that over two days in July 2024, Edwards signed agreements to acquire both JenaValve and JC Medical, the two leading companies competing to bring transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices to market to treat the potentially fatal heart condition. Edwards closed the acquisition of JC Medical in August 2024.\n\nThe FTC said Edwards\u2019 proposed $945 million acquisition of JenaValve would combine the only two companies conducting U.S. clinical trials for a TAVR aortic regurgitation, or TAVR-AR, device.\n\n\u201cThe deal threatens to reduce competition in the TAVR-AR market, likely resulting in reduced innovation, diminished product quality, and potentially increased prices for consumers,\u201d the agency stated in a federal court complaint.\n\nThe commission voted 3-0 to issue an administrative complaint and seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to halt the transaction pending an administrative proceeding. The complaint and injunction request were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nJenaValve is poised to become the first company to bring a TAVR-AR device, called Trilogy, to the U.S. market, the FTC said. Food and Drug Administration approval of a TAVR-AR device by another company besides Edwards and JenaValve is not expected in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe FTC is taking action to stop this anticompetitive deal and ensure that JenaValve and Edwards\u2019 JC Medical subsidiary continue competing to innovate, expand treatment eligibility, and keep down costs,\u201d Daniel Guarnera, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition, said in the agency\u2019s Wednesday statement.\n\nEdwards\u2019 stance\n\nEdwards said Wednesday that it disagrees with the FTC\u2019s decision and believes it will limit the treatment options for patients with aortic regurgitation. Edwards argued that the acquisition will actually \u201caccelerate the availability, adoption and continued innovation of a life-saving treatment for patients suffering from AR.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to continue to pursue regulatory approval for the deal and expects a final determination by the end of the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJenaValve also said that it remains committed to completing the transaction and is confident in the rationale for the merger and the value it will bring to patients. The company intends to join Edwards to defend the case in court.\n\nEdwards increased its forecast for 2025 adjusted earnings per share to the high end of a range of $2.45 to $2.55, up from the high end of a range of $2.40 to $2.50, to reflect the impact of the FTC\u2019s action. The company said there is no impact to revenue guidance.\n\nEdwards agreed to pay $1.2 billion combined in July 2024 to buy JenaValve and Endotronix, which makes an implantable heart failure sensor. With the Endotronix transaction completed, Edwards was expecting the JenaValve deal to close in the middle of this year.",

The market may have expected the deal to close, as Edwards had adjusted its earnings forecast reflecting the FTC's action.\n\n**The big picture:** Edwards Lifesciences previously acquired JC Medical and sought JenaValve, both leaders in transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices for aortic regurgitation (TAVR-AR). JenaValve's Trilogy device is poised to be the first TAVR-AR device to reach the U.S. market. The FTC claims the deal would combine the only two companies conducting U.S. clinical trials for TAVR-AR devices.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Edwards and JenaValve intend to defend the case in federal court.\n*   Edwards expects a final determination on the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** FTC blocks Edwards' acquisition, potentially limiting market growth and treatment options.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$945 million:** Edwards' proposed acquisition of JenaValve.\n*   **3-0:** FTC commission vote to issue administrative complaint.\n*   **$2.45 to $2.55:** New high end of Edwards' 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** Moved to block Edwards' acquisition, citing concerns about reduced competition.\n*   **Edwards Lifesciences:** Company attempting to acquire JenaValve, now facing FTC's legal challenge.\n*   **JenaValve Technology:** Acquisition target of Edwards, committed to completing the transaction.\n*   **JC Medical:** Company Edwards acquired, also a leader in TAVR-AR devices.\n*   **Daniel Guarnera:** FTC's Bureau of Competition director, stated action stops anticompetitive deal.",

        "summary_text": "Medical device companies advocated against future increases to user fees at a public hearing Monday for the next medical device user fee amendments. Meanwhile, Food and Drug Administration leaders, facing congressional budget cuts, made a case for more user fees, emphasizing the importance of the program.\n\nThe five-year agreement determines the amount the FDA can raise from the medtech industry to supplement congressional appropriations. In the current MDUFA program, which ends in September 2027, the FDA\u2019s device center negotiated a boost in user fee funding in exchange for meeting certain review timelines and staffing levels. The next agreement would take effect in October 2027 and run through 2032.\n\nMichelle Tarver, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the FDA \u201crequires sustained and increased investment by the medical device industry\u201d to meet its goals. The device leader added that \u201cholding steady does not lead to excellence \u2014 it leads to mediocrity.\u201d\n\nHowever, device industry lobbyists at the meeting indicated a preference for few changes.\n\n\u201cEach MDUFA cycle included significant resources and investments, including increasing the number of [full-time employees] to support the program,\u201d said Janet Trunzo, senior executive vice president of technology and regulatory affairs for AdvaMed. \u201cNow that we have approached nearly 25 years \u2026 of user fee programs for medical devices, we are now in a position of merely fine-tuning the current program.\u201d\n\nMark Leahey, CEO of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association, called for the process to return \u201cback to the basics\u201d in comments on Monday. Leahey said the funds from MDUFA should go to reviewers and medical officers, and added that the industry wants more visibility as to where the funds are going and \u201cwhere people are right now, realizing there's been some attrition over the last six months.\u201d\n\nCiting the latest user fee rates, Leahey said more than $427 million in fees were authorized for fiscal year 2026.\n\n\u201cWe have to realize the size and scope of the investments here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is not a sustainable pathway.\u201d\n\nThe meeting kicked off a process where the FDA will seek public comment through Sept. 4, before beginning negotiations with industry. When a final agreement is reached, the FDA will present it to Congress, which must approve the next MDUFA program.\n\nThe negotiations come during a period of uncertainty, where several leaders have left the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Trump administration\u2019s slashing of probationary FDA employees in February \u2014 followed by rehiring some staffers, and then more firings in April \u2014 raised questions about whether the FDA\u2019s user fees programs could be at risk.\n\nFDA Commissioner Marty Makary has suggested lowering user fees for prescription drugs; however, he has not indicated any major changes to medical device fees, referring to MDUFA as \u201cthe best of all the user fee arrangements\u201d during the meeting.\n\nPatient advocates call for more fees, transparency\n\nWhile industry pushed back against further fee increases, patient groups called for more fees to offset federal budget cuts to the FDA. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, said that given recent cuts in FDA staffing and the importance of speedy device reviews, \u201cit\u2019s inevitable that improving quality requires increasing the fees.\u201d\n\nZuckerman said that while she would like to see Congress provide enough appropriations for the FDA\u2019s device center, \u201cwe want to make sure that there's funding for everything that's needed, and, unfortunately, appropriations isn't making that possible.\u201d\n\nZuckerman also called for user fees to be used for postmarket device safety, as well as for more transparency during the negotiation process, positions that were supported by other patient advocates during the meeting.\n\nIn the past, user fee negotiations have been behind closed doors, and patients, consumers and health professionals have not been able to join or observe the meetings, Zuckerman said. In the last round of negotiations, the FDA also faced scrutiny for not publishing meeting minutes from its conversations with industry in a timely fashion.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we should have access to remotely watch those negotiations, instead of just depending on minutes that are often vague or very delayed so that stakeholders have no opportunity for meaningful input,\u201d said Tess Robertson-Neel, on behalf of the Patient, Consumer, & Public Health Coalition, a group of more than two dozen nonprofits.\n\nRobertson-Neel added that user fees should be increased, and the FDA should focus on being \u201cmore patient-centered and transparent and less cozy with industry.\u201d\n\nAlexander Naum, policy manager for Generation Patient, a nonprofit representing young adults living with chronic medical conditions, said that user fees must increase and the next MDUFA agreement should include clear postmarket device safety performance goals. He also asked for the FDA to commit funds to expanding its program for tracking medical device adverse events. Naum cited a statistic that the FDA receives more than 2 million reports annually of suspected device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths.\n\n\u201cSo many of us rely on medical devices for our survival,\u201d Naum said. \u201cMany of these devices present the potential of unexpected adverse events.\u201d",

        "summary": "**FDA and Medtech Industry Clash Over Future Medical Device User Fees**\n\n**Key details:**\nA public hearing commenced discussions for the next medical device user fee amendments (MDUFA), set to take effect from October 2027 through 2032. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking increased user fees from the medical device industry, citing the need for sustained investment to meet goals and offset congressional budget cuts. In contrast, medical device companies are advocating against further increases, preferring to \"fine-tune\" the existing program. Patient advocacy groups, however, are pushing for more fees to ensure funding for speedy device reviews and postmarket safety, also demanding greater transparency in negotiations.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis negotiation directly impacts the FDA's funding from the medtech industry, affecting the agency's ability to meet review timelines and staffing levels for device approvals. The industry's pushback on fee increases challenges the prior MDUFA cycle, which saw a boost in user fee funding, indicating a shift in consensus. Furthermore, the dispute over funding sustainability and transparency comes amidst a period of leadership uncertainty and staff changes at the FDA, raising questions about the user fee programs' overall stability.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe MDUFA program is a five-year agreement that determines the amount the FDA can collect from the medical technology industry to supplement its congressional appropriations. The current agreement concludes in September 2027, with the upcoming one covering 2027 to 2032. Past agreements involved the FDA's device center negotiating increased funding in exchange for meeting specific review timelines and staffing. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary referred to MDUFA as \u201cthe best of all the user fee arrangements\u201d at the meeting.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Current MDUFA program ends: September 2027\n*   Next MDUFA program takes effect: October 2027\n*   Next MDUFA program runs through: 2032\n*   User fees authorized for fiscal year 2026: More than $427 million\n*   FDA receives annually: More than 2 million reports of suspected device malfunctions, injuries or deaths\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Food and Drug Administration (FDA):** Seeks sustained and increased user fees from the medical device industry.\n*   **Michelle Tarver:** Director of FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, emphasized the need for increased industry investment.\n*   **AdvaMed:** Medical device industry association whose executive believes the program is in a \"fine-tuning\" phase.\n*   **Janet Trunzo:** Senior executive vice president for AdvaMed, stated the industry wants to fine-tune the current user fee program.\n*   **Medical Device Manufacturers Association:** Industry group whose CEO called for the process to return \u201cback to the basics.\u201d\n*   **Mark Leahey:** CEO of Medical Device Manufacturers Association, requested more visibility on how user funds are spent.\n*   **Robert F.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe first heart valve implanted in a patient using a new robotically assisted approach to valve replacement has been completed at the Cleveland Clinic .\n\nThe Perceval Plus artificial aortic valve, designed by Corcym, was implanted using technology from CardioPrecision, Corcym said Monday.\n\nThe valve was delivered to the patient\u2019s heart through a small incision at the base of the neck. Cleveland Clinic surgeon Marijan Koprivanac used robotic assistance for the procedure, called advanced videoscopic aortic valve surgery by transcervical approach, to implant the valve.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCorcym is working to develop a minimally invasive approach to valve surgery that can offer better outcomes for patients than transcatheter aortic valve replacement, CEO Christian Mazzi said in an interview.\n\nTAVR, in which a replacement valve is threaded through the arteries to the heart via a catheter, has gained in popularity because it is less invasive than open heart surgery, which requires splitting the patient\u2019s sternum. Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic lead the market for TAVR devices.\n\nTraditional valve surgery, however, still provides better long-term clinical results. \u201cUltimately, surgery is the best, most durable intervention you can do for a patient,\u201d said Mazzi. \u201cIt's been proven to last longer, do better in the long run.\u201d\n\nCorcym\u2019s transcervical approach allows the physician to remove diseased tissue during the procedure and aims to enable outcomes similar to traditional surgery, in addition to the benefits of TAVR, such as less pain, faster recovery and less scarring. CardioPrecision\u2019s CoreVista platform works with a robot to support the procedure.\n\n\u201cThat's the whole thing that we're trying to achieve through minimally invasive surgery,\u201d Mazzi said. \u201cThere are all the benefits of TAVR in terms of the short run, with all the benefits of surgery in the long run.\u201d\n\nCombining the artificial heart valve with the new surgical technology means patients should experience less pain and time in the hospital after heart surgery, Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Koprivanac said in a statement. \"In fact, we believe that this may be one of the least invasive surgical heart valve replacement options now available,\" Koprivanac said.",

Corcym's Perceval Plus artificial aortic valve was implanted with technology from CardioPrecision. This procedure, called advanced videoscopic aortic valve surgery by transcervical approach, involved a small incision at the base of the neck. Cleveland Clinic surgeon Marijan Koprivanac used robotic assistance for the implant.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis new minimally invasive approach seeks to offer better patient outcomes than current methods. It aims to combine the benefits of TAVR, such as less pain and faster recovery, with the durable long-term results of traditional surgery. This challenges the current consensus that TAVR is less invasive but traditional surgery provides superior durability. The procedure also allows the physician to remove diseased tissue, a capability not highlighted for TAVR.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has gained popularity because it is less invasive than open heart surgery. However, traditional valve surgery has proven to provide better and more durable long-term clinical results for patients. Corcym and CardioPrecision's transcervical approach aims to bridge this gap. It seeks to provide the short-run benefits of TAVR alongside the long-run advantages of surgery.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   First heart valve implanted in a patient using a new robotically assisted approach.\n*   Procedure performed at the Cleveland Clinic.\n*   Incision made at the base of the neck for valve delivery.\n*   New approach combines benefits of TAVR and traditional surgery.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Corcym:** Designed the Perceval Plus artificial aortic valve and is developing a minimally invasive approach.\n*   **CardioPrecision:** Provided the CoreVista platform and robotic technology used to support the new procedure.\n*   **Cleveland Clinic:** The medical institution where the first robotically assisted heart valve replacement was performed.\n*   **Marijan Koprivanac:** Cleveland Clinic surgeon who performed the robotically assisted valve implant procedure.\n*   **Christian Mazzi:** Corcym CEO, stated the company's goal is to develop a minimally invasive approach for better patient outcomes.\n*   **Edwards Lifesciences:** Leads the market for TAVR devices, a technology potentially challenged by the new approach.\n*   **Medtronic:** Also leads the market for TAVR devices, which the new surgical method aims to surpass.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew robotically assisted surgery seeks to redefine heart valve replacement standards.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Illumina settles $9.8M for software security flaws with federal agencies.\n\n**Key details:** The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a $9.8 million settlement with Illumina. This stems from allegations that Illumina sold genomic-sequencing systems with software vulnerabilities to federal agencies from 2016 to 2023. The government claimed Illumina lacked an adequate security program and knowingly failed to integrate cybersecurity into product design. Illumina denies knowingly selling defective products but settled to avoid litigation costs and distraction.\n\n**Why it matters:** This settlement highlights the DOJ's commitment to holding federal contractors accountable for cybersecurity standards. It underscores the critical importance of protecting sensitive genetic information from cyber threats. For investors, this could challenge any consensus view that dominant market players like Illumina (with 80% share) are immune from significant penalties for cybersecurity non-compliance, emphasizing heightened scrutiny for government suppliers.\n\n**The big picture:** The settlement is part of a broader DOJ effort to enforce cybersecurity compliance among companies supplying the federal government. This commitment aims to ensure protection against cybersecurity risks, particularly for sensitive data. Illumina is described as the dominant company in the global genomic-sequencing market, holding roughly an 80% share.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   $9.8 million: Settlement amount paid by Illumina.\n*   2016-2023: Period of alleged software sales with vulnerabilities.\n*   80%: Illumina's dominant share of the global market.\n*   $1.9 million: Amount received by whistleblower Erica Lenore from the settlement.\n*   2022-2024: Period Illumina claims software issues were successfully remediated.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Department of Justice (DOJ): Announced the settlement holding companies accountable for cybersecurity standards.\n*   Illumina: Settled for $9.8 million over allegations of selling vulnerable genomic-sequencing systems to federal agencies.\n*   Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate: Stated that companies selling to the federal government will be held accountable.\n*   Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Warned in 2023 about a vulnerability in Illumina software that could allow remote takeover.\n*   Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA): Warned in 2022 about a flaw in Illumina's Local Run Manager software.\n*   Erica Lenore: Former Illumina director and whistleblower who received $1.9 million from the settlement.\n*   Aero Turbine Inc.: Defense contractor that reached a $1.75 million settlement for failing cybersecurity standards.\n*   Galant Capital Partners: Private equity firm that reached a $1.75 million settlement related to cybersecurity claims.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Dominant government contractors face accountability for cybersecurity lapses and sensitive data protection.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nLos Angeles-based TruAmerica Multifamily recently announced a series of strategic leadership promotions across its Western U.S. operations aimed at bolstering the firm\u2019s growth trajectory and enhancing its regional management capabilities.\n\n\u201cOur leadership realignment reflects the depth of talent within our organization and our ongoing commitment to building a team that supports both current operations and future expansion,\u201d Mark Enfield, chief administrative officer at TruAmerica, told Multifamily Dive in an email. \u201cAs we scale across the U.S., it\u2019s crucial to place experienced professionals in roles where they can lead with confidence and clarity.\u201d\n\nMark Enfield Permission granted by TruAmerica\n\nAs part of the strategic promotions, Brandy Hildebrand was named senior director of asset management for the Pacific Northwest and Mountain region, where she will oversee nearly 5,000 units across Colorado and New Mexico. Since joining the company in 2020, she has successfully integrated the Colorado Springs and Albuquerque markets into the TruAmerica portfolio, according to a news release shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\nIn the Desert region, Michael Gold will take on a new role focusing on Northern California and organizationwide initiatives, while Erica Joseph will assume broader leadership of the Las Vegas and Phoenix markets, managing nearly 12,000 units. Additionally, Tim Prunotto has been promoted to asset manager, supporting the firm\u2019s portfolios in Las Vegas and Phoenix.\n\n\u201cOur expanded leadership team gives us greater reach and insight into regional opportunities,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWith strong teams in place in markets like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Denver, we\u2019re able to identify operational trends and potential acquisitions more efficiently. These leaders are empowered to act quickly, assess local dynamics and collaborate with our investment teams to pursue opportunities that fit our investment strategies.\u201d\n\nWith the strategic realignment, TruAmerica\u2019s leadership bench is now more integrated and more adaptive, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a team that understands the local nuances of each market and operates with a strong sense of firmwide accountability,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAs the platform grows in complexity, we\u2019re relying on leaders who can mentor others, uphold operational discipline and align with our strategic priorities across different geographies.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said that talent development and succession planning are essential to the company\u2019s regional strategy.\n\n\u201cAs we expand into new markets or deepen our presence in existing locations, we prioritize continuity \u2014 both in performance and in culture,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOur approach ensures that leadership transitions don\u2019t disrupt operations but instead bring fresh perspective with the right institutional grounding. This gives us consistency in execution and allows regional teams to scale alongside the platform.\u201d\n\nA careful transition\n\nBy developing a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d leadership team, TruAmerica believes it will help deliver better communities for residents and stronger results for partners, he said.\n\n\u201cInvesting in high-performing leaders results in better decision-making and more resilient property operations,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cResidents benefit from responsive management and thoughtful community enhancements, while partners see stronger asset performance and more consistent outcomes. A strong leadership team is essential to delivering on both fronts \u2014 improving the resident experience while executing on business plans.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s plan going forward is to transition carefully and support the team with mentorship, detailed onboarding and operational continuity. For instance, Hildebrand has led several onboarding efforts and is now helping integrate new markets into her region. Similarly, Prunotto\u2019s promotion followed a year of close collaboration with senior asset managers, ensuring a seamless shift.\n\n\u201cThese strategies help us maintain consistency in property performance and strengthen community engagement during periods of change,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nWith that in mind, TruAmerica will continue expanding its leadership development efforts by giving rising professionals more exposure to strategic initiatives and regional operations.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure that every market has both operational excellence and leadership stability,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAs we grow, we\u2019re also focused on deepening our investment capabilities and expanding into adjacent strategies like build-for-rent and affordable housing. These initiatives require strong internal talent, and we\u2019re committed to building a team that\u2019s prepared to lead at every level of the firm.\u201d",

Located on the site of a former hotel owned by New York City-based Kushner, the property will include 56 affordable units blended across both buildings.\n\nThe two-building development, designed by Vienna, Virginia-based Lessard Design, will feature a mix of one-bedroom, one-bedroom-plus-den, two-bedroom and two-bedroom-plus-den units. The project is expected to be complete in 2027, according to a news release shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\nLivana Livingston is part of Kushner\u2019s Livana brand, a multifamily concept launched in 2024 to meet the increasing demand for what the company calls \u201csophisticated rental options and aspirational lifestyle living,\u201d according to the release. The brand already includes Livana Fair Lawn and Livana East Hanover, both of which transformed former office sites into rental communities, with several other Livana developments in the pipeline.\n\nEach building at Livana Livingston will offer tailored amenities for residents. The 55-plus collection will promote relaxation and wellness, according to the release, with a fitness center, private men\u2019s and women\u2019s sauna and steam rooms and a coworking mezzanine.\n\nSocial and recreational spaces will include a club room with lounge seating and card tables, a private dining room, a game room with billiards and a golf simulator and a rooftop terrace. Additional spaces for entertainment and relaxation will include dedicated pickleball courts, a pet spa and a community garden lawn.\n\nThe neighboring building will provide all-ages amenities, including a fitness center, a party room, a card and poker room and a hidden speakeasy lounge and movie room. For younger residents, there will be a kids\u2019 playroom and a teen arcade lounge, while outdoor offerings will include a rooftop deck with grilling stations and firepits, a resort-style pool and covered dining and lawn areas for relaxation and entertaining. A coworking mezzanine and pet spa will round out the amenity offerings.\n\n\u201cLivana was envisioned with the goal of providing refined rental communities that speak to how people want to live today,\u201d said Nicole Kushner Meyer, president of Kushner. \u201cFrom young professionals and growing families to 55 and better residents seeking community and convenience, we\u2019re focused on creating residences that combine exceptional design, well-curated amenities and a strong sense of place. Livana Livingston will be a perfect example of that mission brought to life.\u201d\n\nKushner has a growing portfolio of mixed-use and multifamily projects across New Jersey. In addition to Livana Livingston, the firm is currently:\n\nDeveloping 360 rental residences across 15 buildings in Colts Neck\n\nExecuting the large-scale redevelopment of the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown into Monmouth Square, a new town center with 1,000 residential units and 990,000 square feet of retail and restaurants as well as expansive open space.\n\nRevitalizing the Lower Broadway corridor in Long Branch with a 299-unit residential and retail project that will include a SuperFresh grocery market and cafe while enhancing the connection between downtown and Kushner\u2019s oceanfront Pier Village community\n\nIn Northern New Jersey, Kushner is also leasing in Jersey City at The Journal, a nearly $1 billion, 1,723-unit mixed-use development adjacent to the Journal Square PATH train station.

However, in Southern California, COVID-19-era eviction moratoriums and general economic softness related to the national economic picture muted growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all experienced a lot of the noise with public policy and the lack of clarity there. And so I do think companies have been more reticent in hiring and investing, which of course impacts our overall growth,\u201d CEO Angela Kleiman said on the REIT\u2019s earnings call in late July.\n\nUnlike the other major apartment REITs, Essex\u2019s portfolio is exclusively located on the West Coast, which insulates it from some of the concerns faced by national Sun Belt-focused REITs.\n\n\u201cIn the end, ESS' 2Q25 results may not look that bad when the rest of the group's results are in, given DC job/demand risk and Sun Belt peers facing supply headwinds,\u201d wrote Haendel St. Juste, managing director of REITs for investment bank Mizuho Securities, in a note shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\nHere is a look at the regional trends affecting Essex\u2019s performance.\n\nLA issues\n\nThe laws of supply and demand would dictate that apartment owners should have seen a boost in occupancy rates in Q2 after fires ravaged homes in Southern California last January.\n\n\u201cWe didn't expect LA to just suddenly take off,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cBut we did expect that on the occupancy side it would run a little tighter, which is what we had forecasted. And what we are experiencing is that overall macroeconomy softness.\u201d\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not what happened in Q2 for Essex, as net operating income only grew 0.5% from the first quarter. Kleiman said that \u201coverall macro economy softness,\u201d and the lingering effects of eviction moratoriums hampered its performance in Southern California, which constitutes 40% of its portfolio, in the first half of the year..\n\n\u201cWe're five years since COVID,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cThat was 2020, but LA was shut down for three years. The eviction moratorium lasted three years. So we're only in the back half of the second year of this recovery.\u201d\n\nApartment supply was also a challenge in the first half for Essex, along with softening demand. \u201cThe soft demand environment is actually not just in Los Angeles,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cIt's in Southern California as a whole. And I just want to remind everyone that Southern California mirrors the U.S. economy, and the U.S. economy has been soft.\u201d\n\nEven with the lingering problems in Southern California, Kleiman sees declining supply and incoming capital expenditures boosting the region\u2019s rental market.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot going for LA,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cIt is the largest economy by county, with over $1 trillion of GDP, and the infrastructure investment that's earmarked for LA for the World Cup and the Olympics \u2026 is over $80 billion.\u201d\n\nNorthern region strength\n\nFortunately for Essex, 60% of its portfolio lies in its northern West Coast regions, including the Bay Area in California and Seattle.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a steady demand in Northern California and Seattle, and we've not seen any softness \u2026 whether it's traffic or otherwise,\u201d Kleiman said.\n\nThe sharp decline in rents that occurred during and directly after the pandemic is also benefiting Essex.\n\n\u201cEspecially in Northern California, we are still sitting in one of the best affordability positions that we have been in for the history of the company, because rents are just starting to recover and income has grown consistently over the past five years,\u201d Kleiman said.\n\nEssex\u2019s CEO also credits burgeoning job demand in technology and artificial intelligence as a driver for its performance in Northern California, where sequential NOI grew 2% in Q2.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS Category Q2 YOY Change Revenue $410.9 million 3.2% Net operating income $290.9 million 3.3% Operating expenses $120.1 million 2.9% Funds from operations $4.03 3.6% Average rent $2,690 2.4% Occupancy rate 96.2% 0 bps SOURCE: Essex\n\n\u201cWe track the job openings of the top 20 technology companies, and we have seen not an acceleration, but just a gradual, steady increase,\u201d Kleiman said.\n\nIn Seattle, demand remains steady, and sequential NOI increased by 8.5%. \u201cIt's a higher supply market,\u201d Kleiman said. \u201cTherefore, the demand is more influenced by the supply landscape than anything else. And what we're seeing is the demand pressure to shift in the second half, to our favor.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

        "summary_text": "After nearly a decade in development limbo, the 235-unit Prescott Station apartment property is opening its doors in Oakland, California, with the help of modular design.\n\nOriginally entitled in 2012, Prescott Station was paused for nearly a decade before Alameda, California-based MBH Architects was brought on board in 2021 to reinitiate design and guide the project through construction as both modular and site architect, according to Timothy Haley, the project\u2019s director at MBH.\n\nThe six-story project, located on the former site of one of Oakland\u2019s largest encampments of people experiencing homelessness, made use of off-site construction to help provide its income-restricted housing, according to MBH. The building consists of a five-story modular structure over a podium, with units composed of one or two volumetric models, ranging from studios to two-bedroom apartments.\n\nThe architect had worked previously with the project\u2019s builder, Vallejo, California-based Harbinger Homes \u2014 formerly known as Factory_OS \u2014 on other projects throughout California. \u201cThat familiarity with both the technology and their internal processes gave [Oakland-based developer Holliday Development] confidence that we could navigate the project\u2019s restart,\u201d Haley told Multifamily Dive.\n\nHere, Haley talks with Multifamily Dive about the benefits and challenges of modular construction and plans for future projects.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMULTIFAMILY DIVE: How did you accommodate the site\u2019s design and compliance needs within the modular framework?\n\nTIMOTHY HALEY: Fitting multiple unit types into a consistent modular grid required early and deliberate design coordination. Our grid aligned closely with conventional framing standards, but we had to be surgical in how we approached plan layouts, window placements and adjacencies.\n\nTo meet the private open space requirements, we designed prefabricated balconies that were fabricated offsite and attached during installation. These \u201cplug-in\u201d components allowed us to remain within the modular delivery model while ensuring zoning compliance. It's a great example of how modular doesn\u2019t mean inflexible \u2014 it means planning ahead to enable performance on all fronts.\n\nWhat benefits did modular construction provide to the project?\n\nModular gave us several significant advantages\u2014some predictable, and some uniquely valuable given the project\u2019s urban location.\n\nOnce modules were on site, the pace of construction was dramatically accelerated. Controlled factory conditions ensured consistency in detailing, finishes and building envelope. Both hard and soft costs came down thanks to tighter scheduling and minimized weather-related delays.\n\nThe project saw a reduction in carbon footprint and construction waste, with factory efficiencies making a meaningful impact. Because modules were delivered with gypsum board already installed, we reduced the on-site fire load \u2014 a major benefit in dense urban areas. Less time \u201copen\u201d on site meant lower exposure to theft, vandalism or environmental damage.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges you faced in this development?\n\nThe biggest hurdle was coordination \u2014 educating and aligning site contractors and subcontractors unfamiliar with modular methods. Unlike conventional builds, modular construction demands tight sequencing and discipline across trades. You need a team that understands the interdependencies between the factory-built components and site-built systems.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about assembling boxes \u2014 it\u2019s about planning every connection, every tolerance, every delivery window.\n\nDo you anticipate doing further modular projects?\n\nAbsolutely. MBH has completed over 2,200 modular units to date, and we have more in the pipeline. That said, we view modular as one tool in a broader toolkit.\n\nIt\u2019s ideal for certain project types \u2014 especially mid-rise multifamily housing where time, cost and logistics are critical factors. But it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe bigger issue is the housing crisis. We believe the industry needs to approach it from every possible angle \u2014 modular, conventional \u2014 all depending on the site, the budget, and the timeline.\n\nModular is a powerful strategy, but it's not magic. The real advantage of modular comes when you integrate it into the project strategy from day one \u2014 aligning design, budget, logistics and schedule early to maximize efficiency.",

MBH Architects reinitiated its design in 2021, guiding the project as modular and site architect. The six-story building utilizes off-site construction for income-restricted housing, consisting of a five-story modular structure over a podium. Units range from studios to two-bedroom apartments, composed of one or two volumetric models.\n\n**Why it matters:** Modular construction significantly accelerates project pace, ensuring consistent detailing and reducing both hard and soft costs through tighter scheduling. It also offers environmental benefits like reduced carbon footprint and waste, alongside safety advantages such as lower on-site fire load. However, the biggest challenge is coordinating contractors unfamiliar with modular methods, demanding precise sequencing. This approach demonstrates modular's potential to efficiently deliver income-restricted housing, challenging assumptions about traditional construction's pace and cost efficiency for specific project types. It suggests a more nuanced view, where modular isn't inflexible or a magic bullet, but a powerful tool when integrated early.\n\n**The big picture:** Prescott Station endured nearly a decade in development limbo after being entitled in 2012 before restarting in 2021. The project is located on the former site of one of Oakland\u2019s largest encampments of people experiencing homelessness.

The company did not respond to a request for comment from Multifamily Dive.\n\nThe portfolio\u2019s reported 2024 net cash flow was only marginally below issuance underwriting. It was 89% occupied as of December 2024, after sitting at 88% at loan issuance. The loan is not set to mature until July 2029.\n\nLast Fall, Falls Apartment Group faced foreclosure on two other Houston properties \u2014 Falls of Las Villas and the Falls of Alta Vista, according to The Real Deal.\n\nHouston has been a hot spot for multifamily loan issues for several years now. Dallas-based Applesway Investment Group defaulted on nearly $230 million in loans for 3,200 units in Houston in April 2023.\n\nEarlier this year, other Houston-area apartment properties went into servicing.

        "summary_text": "Single-family rent growth was on the rise in the first half of 2025, up to 1.7% year over year, according to a report from Rentometer. The current median rent for a three-bedroom home is $2,135, calculated based on rents in over 1,100 U.S. cities.\n\nAs of now, rent growth for single-family rental homes is trending below the historical 2%-4% range, below wage growth and inflation, according to the report. However, the market is coming off of several years of elevated rent growth in the post-pandemic period. Asking rents for single-family homes have risen 39.5% over the past five years, alongside only a 23% increase in the median household income nationwide, the report said.\n\nThis growth has placed increasing pressure on renters, according to the report, especially in coastal markets. In the most expensive cities, including San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts, renter households would require an annual income of $200,000 or higher to comfortably afford a three-bedroom single-family home \u2014 well over the median local income.\n\nRents rose most rapidly in the Midwest \u2014 up 6.1% across the entire region in the first half of the year \u2014 and the Northeast at 4.5%, followed by the Pacific at 3.1%, the Rocky Mountain region at 1.1% and the Southwest where rents remained flat.\n\nOut of the largest cities, Boston saw the highest annual rent growth at 12.5% YOY, up to $4,500 per month, followed by Staten Island, New York, at 9.4% YOY and Long Beach, California, at 9.0% YOY. The report attributes Boston\u2019s growth to its greater share of larger, higher-priced homes and a tight inventory.\n\nIn contrast, cities with the most affordable single-family rental homes include Toledo, Ohio, at $1,250 and Wichita, Kansas, at $1,350. Fort Wayne, Indiana, recorded the steepest year-over-year decline at -6.4%, followed by Dallas at -6.3%.\n\nDallas has had one of the most robust pipelines of new single-family rental home deliveries during the current construction boom. The city has received over 10,400 new units in the past five years \u2014 second only to the Phoenix metro area, according to the report.\n\nFor rent\n\nVacancies for single-family home rentals have risen to a record high in 2025, up to 6.3% in the first quarter \u2014 the highest level seen since 2016, according to the report. Rentometer attributes this trend to a record number of newly built single-family rental homes over the past several years, given investor interest in the sector.\n\nOver 39,000 new single-family rental homes were delivered in 2024, according to a report from Point2 Homes cited by Rentometer with 101,000 more in the pipeline for future construction. Most of these new units are in the Southeast and Southwest, where rent growth has been slowest.\n\nApartment vacancies came in slightly higher in the first quarter at 8.2%. Overall, this trend creates a greater variety of choices for renters, as well as more bargaining power, which creates a downward pressure on rents in oversupplied or cooling markets, according to the report.\n\n\u201cDespite rising vacancy rates, expanded rental options and declining home prices in some parts of the country, these trends appear to signal a transitional phase rather than a cause for concern,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWhile home prices have fallen in select markets, high mortgage rates and softer consumer confidence continue to keep many renters from entering the housing market. As a result, home purchase activity remains subdued, and renting continues to be the more practical option for a large share of households.\u201d",

Vacancies for single-family rentals hit a record high of 6.3% in Q1 2025, the highest level seen since 2016. This trend is attributed to 39,000 new single-family rental homes delivered in 2024, with 101,000 more in the pipeline. Rents rose fastest in the Midwest (6.1%) and Northeast (4.5%), but saw declines in Fort Wayne (-6.4%) and Dallas (-6.3%).\n\n**Why it matters:**\nRising vacancies and slowing rent growth create more choices and bargaining power for renters, leading to downward pressure on rents in some markets. However, the report suggests these trends indicate a \"transitional phase rather than a cause for concern.\" This challenges a potential consensus of alarm by indicating that while some markets cool, high mortgage rates and softer consumer confidence mean renting remains the practical option for many households. This sustained demand could mitigate severe downturns despite increased supply.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSingle-family rent growth is currently below historical ranges and wage growth, but follows several years of elevated post-pandemic increases.

        "summary_text": "Avoid Costly Shower Failures in Multifamily\n\nIn multifamily development, bathrooms pose one of the highest risks for costly failures, especially in projects with hundreds of units sharing stacked plumbing.\n\nWater intrusion, mold and shower system failures are an industry hazard. For developers planning to sell, these issues often surface during buyer inspections or at closing. For long-term owners, they drain net operating income.\n\nThe Hidden Risks Behind Wet Walls\n\nShowers are complex systems. They require multiple trades: framers, plumbers, tile installers, glaziers, electricians and painters. One mistake can create problems that stay hidden for months.\n\nConsider this: your installers skip the waterproofing membrane before tiling. At first, everything looks fine, but since the grout joints provide multiple points of entry, water seeps through the substrate, creating mold, mildew and wood rot in the wall cavity. By the time the damage is evident, you\u2019ll need to tear out the entire shower, driving costs sky high.\n\nA 2023 National Multifamily Housing Council report found that 70% of claims in multifamily properties involve water damage, making it a very common issue owners face. These claims don\u2019t just mean costly repairs, they often lead to higher insurance premiums and tenant displacement.\n\nWhy Tile and Grout Are Falling Out of Favor\n\nTile and grout dominated multifamily bathrooms for years, but the risks they bring are no longer acceptable.\n\nTile is durable and can last for many years when installed properly. However, grout is inherently porous. Over time, it absorbs moisture, soap residue and body oils, creating the perfect breeding ground for mold. Sealing helps, but protection typically fades within 6\u201312 months (or after a deep cleaning), far shorter than most lease cycles.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Mincey Marble\n\nIn rental units, residents rarely clean grout properly (if at all), leaving property managers to tackle stained, moldy surfaces during turnovers. Your restoration options include hiring a professional to: 1) deep-clean 2) re-grout, or 3) cover it up with an epoxy coating. All are costly and time-consuming. Plus, the coating only lasts 2\u20133 years before peeling with regular use.\n\nTiled shower floors add even more risk. Achieving the correct slope is critical to prevent standing water. In high-volume construction, this detail often gets missed. Pooled water accelerates grout deterioration, increases leak risks and creates hygiene and slip hazards.\n\nBy contrast, pre-fab shower pans feature a built-in slope and a textured surface to prevent standing water and reduce slip risks. These qualities make them ideal for large properties where safety and speed of installation are key.\n\nFiberglass Alternatives\u2014And Their Drawbacks\n\nTo avoid tile maintenance headaches, many developers switch to fiberglass or acrylic shower units. While these systems reduce grout lines, they bring their own issues.\n\nHollow fiberglass pans are designed to sit on a mortar bed, but improper installation can leave gaps beneath the surface. These hollow pockets allow the pan to flex underfoot and over time, this movement creates hairline cracks. Water then seeps unnoticed into the subfloor, leading to hidden damage and costly, professional repairs.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Mincey Marble\n\nFiberglass has a softer finish that\u2019s easily damaged by harsh cleaners, often requiring professional restoration to remove stains and reapply the protective layer. Many properties end up restoring fiberglass between tenants, adding cost and delays. It\u2019s also prone to damage from other trades during construction, with some developers reporting they\u2019ve had to repair 1 in 5 showers before occupancy.\n\nWhy Developers Are Choosing Cast Marble\n\nTo solve these challenges, developers increasingly turn to grout-free cast marble panels and pans. A standard in the hotel industry, this solid, non-porous material prevents moisture absorption and mold growth.\n\nThese systems use three-piece surrounds for fast installation and cast marble pans with built-in slopes that prevent pooling water. Because cast marble showers are groutless and permanently sealed, they don\u2019t require a waterproofing membrane.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Mincey Marble\n\nFor developers planning an exit, these showers cut down punch-list headaches and boost buyer confidence. For long-term owners, they slash maintenance costs, speed up turnovers and protect net operating income.\n\nNot only that, cast marble can create shower walls with geometric designs, exciting 3-dimensional textures and tile-like patterns. Fiberglass showers are much more limited in design, typically placed in properties with lower rental rates. And although both products are groutless, cast marble tile patterns can feature the indistinguishable look and feel of real grout.\n\nThe Stakes Are High\n\nWater damage repairs are some of the costliest in multifamily buildings. Insurance premiums can rise after major claims. Mold remediation adds more complexity, not just in cost, but in tenant health risks and legal liability.\n\nIn multifamily development, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Whether you plan to sell or hold, selecting durable, low-risk shower systems is not just a design choice, it\u2019s a smart risk management strategy.\n\nFor more information about cast marble showers, visit minceymarble.com.",

With high demand and over 400 people on the waitlist, the property faced mounting challenges managing access for residents, visitors and deliveries. Legacy systems\u2014mechanical locks and disconnected fob-based infrastructure\u2014created inefficiencies, increased costs and frustrated staff and residents alike.\n\nProperty Manager Sally Caron struggled with time-consuming tasks like issuing and deactivating fobs, replacing lost keys and juggling multiple systems. Residents, meanwhile, wanted the convenience of mobile credentials they\u2019d experienced elsewhere.\n\nTo solve these issues, Artisan partnered with Comfort Technologies, a Florida-based integrator specializing in multifamily access control. Comfort introduced Allegion, whose open architecture and responsive support made them the ideal technology partner.\n\nIn 2022, the team began upgrading all apartment doors with Schlage Control\u00ae smart locks and ENGAGE\u2122 access control. Residents received new fobs and the option to use Schlage Mobile Bluetooth\u00ae credentials, enabling keyless entry via smartphone. Over time, staff-only areas and retail storage spaces were also upgraded with Schlage NDE wireless locks, reducing the need for physical keys and streamlining access for employees and leaseholders.\n\nThe transformation continued in 2023 with the adoption of Zentra, Allegion\u2019s cloud-based software platform designed for multifamily properties. Zentra centralized access management across perimeter, amenity and unit doors, allowing staff to assign access, create fobs and manage schedules from a single dashboard. Comfort Technologies, the first Zentra Authorized Integrator, handled the upgrade seamlessly.\n\nResidents transitioned to Bluetooth mobile credentials via the Zentra app and in 2024, Artisan became one of the first properties to offer resident key in Apple Wallet. This allowed tenants to unlock doors with a simple tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch\u2014no app required. With Express Mode and Power Reserve, access remained available even when devices needed charging.\n\nThe impact was immediate. Residents appreciated the convenience and security, while staff saw major improvements in operational efficiency. Temporary access for deliveries and housekeeping could be granted instantly. Enrollment and move-out processes became smoother. And with fewer fobs to order and less need for additional personnel, the property saw significant cost savings and a boost in NOI.\n\nLooking ahead, Artisan plans to expand its access control system with additional Schlage devices, including the Schlage XE360 wireless locks and sleek MTB Series wall readers. The property is also preparing to support resident key in Google Wallet, further future-proofing its infrastructure.\n\nAs Caron puts it, \u201cZentra is a game changer. It\u2019s made my job easier in so many ways and our residents feel safer and more empowered.

Currently, 412 units in the portfolio are offline, according to a news release shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\n\u201cHurricane Ida came through the properties and money was not invested back into them,\u201d said Steven Landgraber, senior managing director at New York City-based merchant bank IslandDundon, which was hired to advise Crown Capital on its restructuring strategy. \u201cSome of those units have just been down for quite some time.\u201d\n\nChicago-based commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield and New Orleans-based brokerage firm Larry G.

There is one asset that is about 20% occupied.\u201d\n\nThe portfolio consists of:\n\nCarmel Brook, a 548-unit property, built in 1984\n\nCarmel Spring, a 400-unit property, built in 1983\n\nLaguna Creek, a 216-unit property built in 1981\n\nLaguna Reserve, a 348-unit multifamily community built in 1982\n\nThe portfolio is located within a 3-mile radius along Interstate 10 in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone. That area lost nearly 4,000 units after Hurricane Katrina, making these four properties one-third of the housing stock in the area, according to Schedler.\n\n\u201cThere's a shortage of affordable housing in metro New Orleans, like there is all over the country,\u201d Schedler said. \u201cThis creates a very interesting opportunity for someone. All of these properties have washer-dryer connections, so they would they would be a great candidate for good, solid workforce housing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Schedler said private buyers have shown interest in the portfolio. The right purchaser could potentially transform the entire area.\n\n\u201cIt's a real opportunity for someone to get in there who has the construction expertise to bring these units online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt they would have demand for these units, and I think some of the reverberations of this would certainly help with them trying to create more rooftops out there.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

Occupancy rates range from 20% for one asset to 40-50% for the others.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhy it matters: This portfolio represents a significant portion\u2014one-third\u2014of the housing stock in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone, an area that lost nearly 4,000 units after Hurricane Katrina. The sale offers a unique opportunity for an investor with construction expertise to address a critical shortage of affordable housing in metro New Orleans. This situation challenges a consensus that new development is the sole solution by highlighting the revitalization potential of existing, distressed assets to meet high demand.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe big picture: The properties were formerly owned by Crown Capital, whose principal was sentenced for wire fraud. These assets have been \"starved for capital\" and \"lacked leadership\" due to prior management's absence and legal issues. Significant damage from Hurricane Ida was not addressed with necessary investment. The properties are located in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone, an area critically short of housing.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   1,512 total units across four multifamily properties.\n*   412 units currently offline.\n*   Moshe \u201cMark\u201d Silber sentenced to 30 months in prison.\n*   Three properties are 40-50% occupied; one asset is about 20% occupied.\n*   The portfolio is one-third of the housing stock in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Crown Capital:** Former owner of the four multifamily properties now for sale.\n*   **Moshe \u201cMark\u201d Silber:** Principal at Crown Capital, sentenced for wire fraud conspiracy.\n*   **IslandDundon:** Merchant bank hired to advise Crown Capital on its restructuring strategy.\n*   **Steven Landgraber:** Senior managing director at IslandDundon, noted properties were starved for capital.\n*   **Cushman & Wakefield:** Commercial real estate services firm leading the portfolio's sales effort.\n*   **Larry G. Schedler & Associates:** Brokerage firm leading sales alongside Cushman & Wakefield.\n*   **Larry Schedler:** Principal of Larry G. Schedler & Associates, discussed property needs and market opportunity.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Offers for the properties are due September 10.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDistressed New Orleans properties offer significant revitalization opportunity for investors.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe European Union will delay by six months the implementation of its countermeasures to U.S. tariffs that were meant to go into effect Thursday, according to Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade.\n\nThe commission plans to adopt the necessary measures to implement the pause on Tuesday, per Gill.\n\nLast month, the commission approved a regulation that would have installed levies of up to 30% on a swath of U.S. goods on Aug. 7. Steel and aluminum products were among the affected categories, partially in response to the U.S. re-upping a series of Section 232 tariffs on those products. Countermeasure amounts vary across categories, topping out at 25%.\n\nThe EU also countered the United States\u2019 separate 25% duties on aluminum cans and canned beer, announced in April, with its own 25% duty. And it countered U.S. tariffs on scrap iron, steel and aluminum with a ban on those products starting Sept. 7.\n\nThe initial measure detailing EU counter tariffs passed days before European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland for trade negotiations. Those discussions led to a framework deal in which the U.S. agreed to lower planned tariffs on imports from the bloc from 30% to 15%. Under the pact, the bloc agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy exports and make a $600 billion investment in the country. However, the agreement did not cover steel and aluminum imports, which currently face a 50% U.S. tariff globally.\n\n\u201cThis deal provides a framework from which we will further reduce tariffs on more products, address non-tariff barriers and cooperate on economic security, because when the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible on both sides,\u201d von der Leyen said after the two leaders announced the agreement, adding that \u201cdetails have to be sorted out.\u201d\n\nDays later, Trump signed an executive order placing country-specific reciprocal duties on over 60 trading partners, including a 15% rate for imports from the EU, effective Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cThe EU continues to work with the US to finalise a Joint Statement, as agreed on 27 July,\u201d Gill said.\n\nThe EU has now delayed its countermeasures to U.S. tariffs three times, first announcing its intention in May to levy tariffs on 95 billion euros (roughly $107 billion at the time of announcement) of U.S. goods.\n\nThe bloc was also readying additional countermeasures covering 72 billion euros (roughly $84 billion) of U.S. imports, Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said on July 13.\n\nKatie Pyzyk contributed reporting to this article.",

The European Commission plans to formalize this pause on Tuesday. These levies, previously approved by the commission, would have imposed duties of up to 30% on various U.S. goods, including steel and aluminum products, starting August 7. This action was largely a response to renewed U.S. Section 232 tariffs and other duties on products like aluminum cans.\n\n**Why it matters:** This delay postpones a direct trade escalation between the European Union and the United States, which had been preparing to implement new levies. While a framework deal was previously announced, it explicitly did not resolve disputes over steel and aluminum imports, which still face significant U.S. tariffs. This pause suggests a potential shift from escalating trade tensions, despite the U.S. implementing new reciprocal duties and the EU having readied further countermeasures. It may challenge a view of continued, unchallenged trade conflict.\n\n**The big picture:** The EU's initial counter-tariffs were passed ahead of a meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. This meeting resulted in a framework deal where the U.S. agreed to reduce planned tariffs on EU imports to 15%, while the EU agreed to substantial U.S. energy purchases and investments. However, this pact explicitly did not resolve issues regarding steel and aluminum imports, which still face 50% U.S. tariffs globally. This latest delay marks the third time the EU has postponed its countermeasures.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   EU countermeasures would have imposed levies up to 30% on U.S. goods.\n*   The U.S. agreed to lower planned tariffs on EU imports from 30% to 15% in a framework deal.\n*   Under that pact, the EU agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy exports.\n*   Steel and aluminum imports currently face a 50% U.S. tariff globally.\n*   The EU was readying additional countermeasures covering 72 billion euros (roughly $84 billion) of U.S. imports.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Olof Gill:** European Commission spokesperson for trade, announced the EU's six-month delay of countermeasures.\n*   **Ursula von der Leyen:** European Commission President, discussed trade negotiations and framework deal with U.S. President.\n*   **Donald Trump:** U.S. President, negotiated trade deal with EU and signed executive order on reciprocal duties.\n*   **Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d:** Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, stated the EU was readying additional import countermeasures.\n*   **Katie Pyzyk:** Contributed reporting to the news article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The European Commission plans to adopt necessary measures to implement the pause on Tuesday.\n*   The EU continues working with the U.S. to finalize a Joint Statement agreed on July 27.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** EU's six-month delay pauses tariff escalation, opening door for further U.S. trade talks.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors filed a lawsuit last week challenging the law establishing Oregon\u2019s now-active extended producer responsibility for packaging program.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Oregon\u2019s program is \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d citing nondelegation doctrine, federal dormant commerce clause, federal unconstitutional conditions doctrine and federal and state due process. NAW believes the law inhibits interstate commerce and also disputes aspects of how the selected producer responsibility organization is operating, among other issues.\n\ndoctrine, federal dormant commerce clause, federal unconstitutional conditions doctrine and federal and state due process. believes the law inhibits interstate commerce and also disputes aspects of how the selected producer responsibility organization is operating, among other issues. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Environmental Commission and Oregon\u2019s attorney general were named as defendants in the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOregon passed the Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act in 2021, the second packaging EPR law in the United States. Oregon had the distinction this year of becoming the first U.S. state to have its program go live.\n\nEPR programs in different industries have long existed in other countries. While many packaging industry stakeholders were skeptical of EPR in the U.S., some groups have come to support recently passed legislation in states including Minnesota, Washington and Maryland. To date, seven states in total have passed these types of laws, each with slightly different parameters. Oregon\u2019s law allows for multiple producer responsibility organizations, but so far only one is active: Circular Action Alliance.\n\nNAW previously wrote to Oregon DEQ on June 4 asking for a one-year delay to the effective date or enforcement of the Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act. NAW says it represents some 30,000 firms, with its membership including line of trade associations as well as distribution companies.\n\n\u201cWhile NAW supports the goal of a circular economy, the Oregon EPR law as enacted is unconstitutional,\u201d said NAW President and CEO Eric Hoplin in a statement. \u201cOregon chose to shift the burden to the parts of the supply chain that have little to no control over decisions to design, reduce, reuse or recycle a product.\u201d The complaint asserts that \u201cthere has never been an EPR program like this.\u201d\n\nLooking beyond Oregon, NAW is \u201creviewing all of the various proposals to implement EPR programs wherever they are being discussed,\u201d according to a spokesperson. In Colorado, for example, NAW sent a letter to the Department of Public Health and Environment on July 23 requesting a one-year delay to the July 31 reporting deadline for the state\u2019s packaging EPR program.",

The complaint alleges the law is \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d citing federal dormant commerce clause and due process, among other doctrines. NAW believes the law inhibits interstate commerce and disputes the selected producer responsibility organization's operation. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Environmental Commission, and Oregon\u2019s attorney general were named as defendants.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis lawsuit challenges the Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act, which made Oregon the first U.S. state to have its EPR program go live. It matters for investors because NAW, representing 30,000 firms, alleges the law unconstitutionally shifts burden to parts of the supply chain with little control. This could challenge the growing consensus among some stakeholders who have come to support EPR legislation in other states. The complaint asserts \u201cthere has never been an EPR program like this,\u201d highlighting a potential unique legal hurdle for similar initiatives.\n\n**The big picture:**\nOregon passed its Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act in 2021, the second packaging EPR law in the United States. EPR programs have long existed in other countries, and seven U.S. states now have similar laws with varying parameters. While initially skeptical, some packaging industry stakeholders now support legislation in states including Minnesota, Washington, and Maryland. NAW is also actively reviewing other EPR proposals across the country, having previously sought delays for programs in Oregon and Colorado.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2021:** Year Oregon passed its Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act.\n*   **2:** Oregon was the second U.S. state to pass a packaging EPR law.\n*   **7:** Total number of U.S. states that have passed packaging EPR laws.\n*   **30,000:** Number of firms represented by the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.\n*   **June 4:** Date NAW previously requested a one-year delay for Oregon\u2019s law.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW):** Filed a lawsuit challenging Oregon's EPR program, representing 30,000 firms.\n*   **Oregon Department of Environmental Quality:** Named as a defendant in the lawsuit challenging the state's EPR program.\n*   **Oregon Environmental Commission:** Named as a defendant in the lawsuit challenging the state's EPR program.\n*   **Oregon's attorney general:** Named as a defendant in the lawsuit challenging the state's EPR program.\n*   **Eric Hoplin:** NAW President and CEO, stated the Oregon EPR law is unconstitutional.\n*   **Circular Action Alliance:** The only active producer responsibility organization in Oregon's EPR program.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWholesalers' lawsuit challenges Oregon's EPR, potentially altering future state recycling programs.",

However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

Graphic Packaging International (GPI), a major recovered fiber user and North America's largest paper cup producer, called it a \"major milestone.\" The move challenges previous difficulties with recycling paper cups due to coatings, as newer packaging designs and technological advances now make fiber recovery more efficient. GPI has designed its new Waco, Texas, mill to utilize up to 15 million paper cups daily, tapping into this \"high-quality, underutilized fiber source\" that often ends up in landfills.

They offered few additional details and didn\u2019t say when it was purchased, but presumably in the past three months.\n\n\u201cWe recently acquired Everlink, a leading provider of integrated payment solutions to Canadian financial institutions, further executing on our international expansion strategy,\u201d FIS CEO and President Stephanie Ferris said during the call.\n\nStephanie Ferris Courtesy of FIS\n\nA spokesperson for the company didn\u2019t immediately have a comment regarding how much was paid for the business, and how many employees may be absorbed in the merger.\n\nEverlink, based in Ontario near Toronto, provides its integrated payments services to financial institutions and reaches about 90,000 Canadian merchants, handling about 2.62 billion transactions annually, according to the company\u2019s website. It also has about 2,300 ATMs under its management and has issued about 5.5 million debit cards.\n\nThe acquisition will add about $20 million in annual revenue, FIS Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe told analysts on the earnings call. While it\u2019s not clear how much was paid, the company made no disclosures about the acquisition in its quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission so presumably it was immaterial.\n\nDuring the call, Ferris pointed to the Everlink acquisition, as well as the April agreement to purchase an issuer business from Global Payments, as key merger-and-acquisition components driving international expansion. Also in April, FIS said it would sell its minority stake in its merchant business Worldpay to Global Payments.\n\nFerris also suggested there are more acquisitions coming soon. \u201cWe have a robust pipeline of M&A opportunities across our key growth sectors, with additional acquisitions expected shortly,\u201d Ferris said on the earnings call Tuesday.\n\nFIS is very familiar with Everlink because it bought out the company\u2019s former majority owner, Metavante Technologies, back in 2009. Then, FIS sold a majority interest in Everlink to CO-OP Financial Services in 2015.\n\nMark Ripplinger, who was Everlink\u2019s president at the time of the 2009 transaction, still holds that role today and has added the CEO post, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nEverlink was founded in 2004 by a group of payments executives behind New York Cash Exchange, or NYCE, and a Calgary credit union-owned entity called Celero Solutions, according to its website. The company was created to provide \u201cgrowing demand in the Canadian credit union marketplace for a new debit switching alternative,\u201d according to its website.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Ferris explained why FIS purchased Everlink. \u201cWe think it fits very nicely into our payments portfolio, and they're also very excited to be part of the FIS umbrella,\u201d Ferris said during the call to discuss the second-quarter earnings report. \u201cWe think we can really add distribution and scale for them.\u201d\n\nAside from the acquisition, FIS executives discussed a second-quarter downturn for the company\u2019s capital markets solutions business segment, which provides its technology and software services to trading firms, brokers and investment. It\u2019s the smaller of two key FIS business segments, with the other larger banking solutions segment focused on providing technology and software to banks and credit unions.\n\n\u201cWe did see some softness, temporary softness, in our lending business, largely tied to the slowdown in large financial institutions\u2019 loan syndication activity in the second quarter, specifically related to some macroeconomic uncertainty,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cThe good news is, in July and into August, we've been seeing a very nice rebound in that syndication activity.\u201d\n\nSecond-quarter revenue for the capital markets segment still increased 6% to $765 million while revenue for the company\u2019s banking segment also rose 6% to $1.8 billion, according to the quarterly report.\n\nFIS\u2019s second-quarter gross profit inched up less than 1% to $952 million, according to the quarterly filing. Meanwhile, accounting related to the transactions with Global Payments resulted in a net loss of $469 million, compared to net income of $238 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, second-quarter revenue climbed 5% to $2.62 billion.",

No deal has been finalized, according to the Journal. Goldman Sachs holds about $20 billion in Apple Card balances, the newspaper reported.\n\nSpokespeople for Goldman Sachs, Apple and JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nApple\u2019s annual revenue from its card business amounts to $50 million, according to analysts at Baird.

Consultants suggest JPMorgan's interest extends beyond the credit card business itself. The banking giant is reportedly looking to make inroads in servicing other Apple products and marketing to Apple Card users. Access to demographic data on millions of users is a key driver for this potential acquisition.\n\n**Why it matters:** JPMorgan acquiring the Apple Card portfolio could significantly expand its digitally-inclined customer base, challenging the current consensus that the Apple Card is a minor revenue stream for Apple. This move suggests a strategic play by JPMorgan to gain access to Apple's vast digital ecosystem and user data. It could allow JPMorgan to cross-sell myriad banking products to a new target market and potentially provide a \"back door\" into the lucrative Apple Pay digital wallet, shifting the competitive landscape from Goldman Sachs.\n\n**The big picture:** JPMorgan Chase is the nation's largest bank, seeking to integrate with tech platforms like Apple. Apple, a tech behemoth, currently partners with Goldman Sachs for its credit card, which serves a younger millennial target market. The potential acquisition highlights an increasing trend for banks to expand their reach through strategic partnerships offering access to large, digitally native customer bases.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Goldman Sachs holds about $20 billion in Apple Card balances.\n*   Apple\u2019s annual revenue from its card business amounts to $50 million.\n*   JPMorgan\u2019s annual revenue was $177.56 billion for 2024.\n*   Apple had 12 million Apple Card users in January 2024.\n*   Apple Pay had an estimated 65.6 million users in the U.S. and 616 million globally in 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **JPMorgan Chase:** Nation's largest bank, in advanced talks to take over Apple's credit card portfolio.\n*   **Apple:** Tech behemoth, considering a new credit card partner for its Apple Card.\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** Current holder of Apple's credit card portfolio, with $20 billion in balances.\n*   **Tom Bell:** Senior advisor at AlixPartners, sees an opportunity for a compelling digital bank solution.\n*   **David True:** Partner at PayGility, believes JPMorgan would gain a much bigger customer base.\n*   **Richard Crone:** CEO of Crone Consulting, suggests the deal offers a \"back door to Apple Pay's wallet rails.\"\n*   **Baird:** Analysts who estimated Apple's annual card business revenue.\n*   **Capital One:** Research cited for Apple Pay user estimates.\n*   **Wall Street Journal:** Reported on July 29 about the advanced negotiation talks.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The finalization of the credit card partnership deal between JPMorgan Chase and Apple.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** JPMorgan eyes Apple Card for wider customer access beyond just credit.",

        "summary_text": "Today\u2019s finance chiefs are steadily assuming a rising host of responsibilities outside of finance \u2014 an evolution that is also shining a spotlight on the critical, interconnected role of the finance function.\n\nFor newly-minted Finzly CFO Adam Carson, \u201cfinance is not a passive or backseat function at all,\u201d he told CFO Dive, but rather, \u201ca driving partnership with the business.\u201d\n\nThe first-ever finance chief for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, Carson\u2019s appointment earlier this month comes as Finzly seeks to further expand its operations and market reach, according to a July 17 press release announcing the move. Alongside Carson, Finzly also appointed Robert Coakley as head of partnerships, according to the release. The company provides payments infrastructure to financial institutions and supports payment rails including ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT and instant payments.\n\nIn his first few months as finance chief, Carson is focusing on ensuring the finance function is well-positioned to help Finzly\u2019s strategic goals of expansion. For any finance chief coming into a new situation \u2014 whether the company\u2019s first CFO or otherwise \u2014 the focus is on determining if the business is set up effectively for where it needs to go in the future, \u201cand you want to assess that around the people, the technology and the partnerships and processes that you have in place,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWhat you're looking for is ultimately, alignment on how you get from where you are today to where you think the business strategically needs to be in the future, and how does finance contribute to that growth rate?\u201d Carson said.\n\nA culture of connectivity\n\nA veteran of the software industry, Carson was attracted to the top financial seat at Finzly due to the combination of its previous success \u2014 the business\u2019 clients include financial entities such as Arvest, Banc of California, and Everbank \u2014 and its future growth potential. His background and the ambitions of Finzly\u2019s founder and CEO, Booshan Rengachari, also \u201clined up well in terms of where the company was going,\u201d he said of taking the seat.\n\nCarson\u2019s past roles in the software space include stints at Intuit, Barracuda Networks and Cyence, and he most recently served as CFO for private equity-backed software-as-a-service firm Movista, according to his LinkedIn profile. As VP, finance and investor relations for Barracuda, Carson helped to facilitate the cybersecurity provider\u2019s initial public offering in 2013, before the company was sold to Thoma Bravo for $1.6 billion in 2017, according to reports at the time from Reuters and Dark Reading.\n\nIn assuming the CFO seat for Finzly, Carson\u2019s priority is to help the business continue to \u201cevolve, grow and scale,\u201d he said, noting the company\u2019s processes and customer focus are \u201crock solid.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, \u201ca few things I want to enhance\u201d surrounding the company\u2019s ability to deliver insights at speed and scale, Carson said. That means taking a close look at how the company\u2019s teams communicate \u2014 and ensuring they have the details they need from finance to effectively achieve their goals.\n\nAs finance chief, \u201cI get to work with every single person in the company, directly or indirectly, because what they do, day in, day out, how they're delivering for our customers and the decisions that they're making, ultimately reflect on the financials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to create a culture where that cohesion and connectivity is really embedded in everything that we do, because that's already how people are operating, and I just want to help them with the financial information so that they can see it even more transparently,\u201d Carson said.\n\nPreparing for the long haul\n\nCarson is joining the bank payments infrastructure provider as it plans for further expansion \u2014 the strategic priorities remain largely on striving to become \u201cone of the critical platforms for banks going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong other recent steps, Finzly helped to aid its client banks with the shift to the new ISO 20022 standard \u2014 an international protocol for exchanging electronic messages between financial institutions \u2014 put in place by the Federal Reserve ahead of its July 14 deadline, according to a company press release.\n\nIn past years, the company has also reported rapid growth, noting a surge in payment platform volume and a doubling of revenue from 2022 to 2023, according to a company release. In 2023, the company also raised $10 million, led by TZP Group, Banking Dive reported at the time.\n\nThe company\u2019s liquidity isn\u2019t necessarily something Carson is worried about at the moment, he said, noting funding and liquidity are always dependent on company strategy. Presently, the finance chief plans to ensure the company is continuing to successfully deliver its offerings to its customers, which means achieving the careful balance that is the constant challenge for those in the CFO role: setting up the company to meet long-term goals while, \u201cat the same exact time you're working to minimize execution risk on those things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you balance those two, what you have to do is, you have to become incredibly clear on, \u2018why are we doing something, what is in it for us over the long haul, and also, how are we going to be able to better serve our employees and our customers?\u2019\u201d Carson said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nStablecoins have drawn headlines following President Donald Trump\u2019s signing of the Genius Act last month.\n\nUse of digital assets, including stablecoins, have grown steadily for cross-border transactions due to lower costs, less friction and faster settlements, with transaction volume of nearly $28 trillion last year, more than the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard, according to a June 2025 digital payments report from industry consulting firm The Strawhecker Group.\n\nUnlike some other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, stablecoins are typically tied to the value of a fiat currency, like the dollar, to reduce their price volatility.\n\nThey\u2019ve evolved from \u201ca niche digital currency\u201d the Strawhecker report said, as \u201cstablecoins power a growing share of global crypto trading, enable low-cost remittances, streamline merchant payouts, support underbanked countries, and offer a way for people in regions with volatile currencies to preserve value in dollars.\u201d\n\nStablecoins\u2019 acceleration into the mainstream is likely to quicken as U.S. regulators begin implementing the Genius law\u2019s policy framework, counteracting stricter crypto policies during the Biden administration.\n\nFor example, PayPal Holdings touted a new \u201cPay with Crypto\u201d tool on July 28 that allows \u201cinstant crypto to stablecoin or fiat conversion\u201d and supports \u201c100+ crypto currencies and wallets,\u201d according to a press release. The company debuted its dollar-denominated stablecoin, PayPal USD, two years ago.\n\nThe earliest use cases for stablecoin have been to settle cross-border transactions, facilitate lower-cost remittances and to store value for people in nations afflicted with severe inflation.\n\nBut most of these stablecoin transactions occur far from the daily lives of ordinary consumers in America, many of whom are perhaps puzzled about digital currencies. That raises the question: Will stablecoins become a payment choice at local shops and gas stations for millions of smartphone-carrying U.S. consumers?\n\nPayments Dive asked payments and digital asset industry professionals for their thoughts on how, and when, stablecoins might filter down to consumer-level payments.\n\nComments have been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nAlexandra \u2018Lexy\u2019 Prodromos\n\nNeochordia Consulting\n\nPayments, product and emerging technology consultant\n\n(Former Discover Financial Services innovation and strategic product manager)\n\nWhat the Genius Act does, especially with the permitted payment stablecoin issuer registration, it allows there to be a more level playing field for companies or banks and payment networks if they want to issue their own stable points. There's this standardization across the board, which I think will make them more easy to regulate, and I think allow greater access.\n\nIf you're able to use stablecoins and basically extend the value of the U.S. dollar to other markets in the world, and for consumers especially to be able to have this other option where they can basically use the same technology that makes cryptocurrencies interesting, but then have the price stability of the U.S. dollar, I think that opens up so many more avenues for smaller merchants and the ability for them to conduct their businesses with consumers overseas. So, I think that this is something that is really going to explode.\n\n\n\nKirill Gertman\n\nConduit Technology\n\nCEO, Founder\n\nFor stablecoins to be an actual daily payment method, you need a convergence from both sides. From the consumer side, where we\u2019re not there yet, we\u2019re getting there step by step by step. We\u2019re getting payroll now, we're getting e-commerce. And then from the merchant side, the economics just make sense. So, we will probably see at least the largest ones issue their own coins.\n\nFor large merchants doing a lot of these cross-border (transactions), those are extremely expensive. And they can make money on this. If they\u2019re issuing a stablecoin \u2026 they\u2019re actually making money on (holding) the underlying Treasuries, the short-term stuff. And so now, on one hand, they can save money. On the other hand, if they\u2019re big enough, they can actually make money. So, as a large enough merchant, why wouldn\u2019t you? I think the merchants will want this.\n\nWhat I think is going to happen and maybe create a problem here is that, imagine a scenario where every freaking merchant has its own stablecoin. Amazon has a coin. Walmart has a coin and Starbucks has a coin. And now as a consumer you\u2019re walking into Starbucks, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh sh\u2013, I have Amazon coin in my mobile wallet, I don\u2019t have Starbucks coin. What am I going to do with this?\u2019 That\u2019s going to create a problem, that\u2019s going to create friction, essentially there will be a need for a clearing house. Like we have the clearing house on fiat transactions, we\u2019re going to need to have something like that on stablecoins as well. And then if it works really well, and if it\u2019s really seamless, the consumer doesn\u2019t notice it. They pay with a Starbucks coin for Amazon or the Walmart coin for whatever, then it\u2019ll work. If it\u2019s not seamless enough, it's not going to work. So that\u2019s the opportunity, but that\u2019s also the challenge.\u201d\n\nCorey Frayer\n\nConsumer Federation of America\n\nDirector of Investor Protection\n\n(Former Securities and Exchange Commission crypto policy advisor under Biden)\n\nYou\u2019ll see mainstream adoption of stablecoins not because people want them but because companies want to give them to their customers. You\u2019re seeing forced adoption and regulatory favoritism as the impetus for adoption of crypto, not some value in the underlying technology.\n\nWhen you deregulate something as large as the payments ecosystem, you can guarantee that the money will start flowing through it almost instantly. My prediction is that within 18 months it\u2019s going to be relatively common for people to be moved into what is being described as stablecoin payment systems. Because the functional difference between a stablecoin and a current digital payment is minute. And the deregulatory benefit is enormous, and so we\u2019ll see people move to that quickly.\n\nAmanda Fischer\n\nBetter Markets\n\nPolicy Director, Chief Operating Officer\n\n(Former SEC chief of staff under Biden administration)\n\nI think that [stablecoins] may become an emerging form of payments, but I don't think that that\u2019s because they offer a superior payments experience. I think it's more because of the favorable provisions in legislation and the lobbying and the hype and the marketing, rather than their actual use case.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly risky and it\u2019s bad for consumers and the financial system. But for [merchants, they] get out of interchange, they get people to keep their money in your ecosystem. The more money they keep in their ecosystem, the more interest that they can earn for basically free.\n\nBen Weiss\n\nCoinFlip\n\nCEO\n\nWe, as a company, already see a bunch of people in countries outside the U.S. buying stablecoins because they want access to the dollar. So stablecoins also basically dollarize the world.\n\nWe think stablecoins solve a lot of international payments issues, but could also solve payment issues in the U.S. I know many merchants aren't happy about the interchange fee they're paying [for acceptance of cards]. That being said, nothing happens overnight, right? There are people in the U.S. who still write checks.",

Its current CFO, Chad Noble, will become the company\u2019s chief information officer, the company announced July 23.\n\nKoenninger previously served as CFO of the company from November 2021 to November 2022, according to her LinkedIn page. \u201cHer return reflects our commitment to sharpening our financial strategy and execution,\u201d Central Payments CEO Nikkee Rhody said in the release.

Finzly recently was instrumental in aiding banks with their shift to the new ISO 20022 international standard.\n\nWhile several fintech firms have sought new CFOs to manage their finances and strategy, others have tapped seasoned professionals as the cryptocurrency industry adapts to its new regulatory outlook prompted by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump issued an executive order calling for the establishment of a digital asset market working group to recommend policy changes to his administration. This month, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, widely known as the Genius Act, into law, introducing new regulations for the digital asset sector.\n\nAmid the regulatory changes impacting the cryptocurrency industry, payments veterans are shaking up their leadership as they enter the digital asset market.\n\nBastion, the digital asset and stablecoin infrastructure provider, hired Jared Klee as its head of revenue, placing him in charge of the company\u2019s end-to-end revenue strategy and increasing profitability, according to a July 9 press release.\n\nKlee brings prior experience from previous venture capital, tech and digital asset companies, including IBM, the insurance firm Vouch and the blockchain company Triple Point Liquidity. Klee\u2019s appointment was the fourth leadership change the company made in six months, sparked by \u201cstrong tailwinds across the digital assets industry and rising demand for enterprise-grade cryptocurrency products,\u201d the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Depot, the Atlanta-based Bitcoin ATM operator and fintech firm, named Philip Brown as its chief compliance officer, the company announced July 21. Bitcoin Depot allows customers to buy cryptocurrencies at its 8,800 kiosks in North America. As the company plots its expansion, Brown will be in charge of anti-money laundering, know-your-customer protocols, transaction monitoring and state compliance strategies.\n\nFintech firms are preparing to expand their reach as the use of digital payments grows in the coming years. In a March report, the payments processor Worldpay predicted digital payment methods, including digital wallets, buy now, pay later services and account-to-account payments, will exceed $33.5 trillion by 2030.\n\nAnother type of kiosk operator that converts coins to other forms of currency, Coinstar, appointed Brandon Thompson as its new chief commercial officer, where he will work to drive growth in the U.S. and abroad. Thompson brings more than 20 years of prior experience at various companies, including Netspend and Green Dot, per his LinkedIn page.\n\nAs part of his new role, Thompson will be tasked with expanding the reach of its digital wallet service, per the July 30 announcement.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMastercard CEO Michael Miebach expects the open banking trend to keep gaining ground, and seems to prefer that over banks charging for consumer data.\n\nThe card network chief gave his view on the recent controversial practice of banks charging for consumer data Thursday after an analyst asked about it during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.\n\nIt has emerged as an issue after JPMorgan Chase said last month it would begin charging fintechs that seek to aggregate and use consumer data that JPMorgan Chase has collected. Other banks could follow suit as fintechs seek to amass data from many financial institutions.\n\nThe decision by JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, followed a pullback by the Trump administration on open banking, also known as open finance, which allows consumers to more easily shift their data between companies.\n\nThe administration reversed course by saying in May that it would scrap the open banking rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. The rule was aimed at giving consumers more control over their data and a smoother path for switching from one financial services provider to another.\n\nLast week, the administration softened its position on open banking rule, telling a federal judge overseeing litigation related to the opening banking rule that the agency would seek to revise the regulation.\n\nIn touching on the U.S. developments, Miebach noted open banking has taken hold in Europe and Australia, calling it an \u201cimportant topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur fundamental belief [is that] consumer consented data and their ability to share that is very important, and that will be a winning proposition over time,\u201d he said\n\nHe also showed that he believes open banking is generally a positive phenomenon. \u201cThis whole idea that a consumer can use their data footprint to avail [themselves] of better services in the finance space\u2026I think it\u2019s a good notion and it generally resonates and will not go away,\u201d Miebach said.\n\nIn 2020, Mastercard acquired data-sharing startup Finicity for $825 million to advance its ability to provide services related to the use of consumer data by fintechs, banks and other lenders. That\u2019s particularly an advantage in an open banking environment that has given rise to fintechs competing to offer services, often via new customer apps. Banks have been keen to fend off competition from those nascent firms.\n\nMastercard, which ostensibly could be subject to paying banks for data, hasn\u2019t engaged in conversations about such fees, Miebach suggested, noting the company will monitor the situation. He also emphasized that banks, which issue cards, are critical partners for the company.\n\n\u201cWe don't really have full visibility here on what is being specifically considered by a number of banks,\u201d Miebach said during the call, referring to banks as \u201cfantastic partners of ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cVarious economic considerations are out there that are being discussed in the [news] coverage that will have to be figured out, but it's not something that we have been engaged in at this point.\u201d\n\nOn a related front, Miebach pointed to the rising importance of safeguarding such data with cybersecurity tools, including artificial intelligence defenses, as fraud threats mount.\n\n\u201cWe've also been incredibly focused on leveraging our data to drive better engagement solutions for our customers,\u201d Miebach said. \u201cSo, if you think in a more digital world your cyber risks will go up, that's why cybersecurity is at the focus of what we're doing.\u201d\n\nLast year, Mastercard also made a big acquisition on the cybersecurity front, buying Recorded Future for $2.65 billion.\n\n\u201cOn the cybersecurity side, the stakes are getting higher and higher \u2013 the fraudsters are using the latest technology, using artificial intelligence \u2013 generative AI \u2013 to power their solutions,\u201d Miebach explained. \u201cOn the cybersecurity side, we're doing exactly the same.\u201d\n\nAlso during the call, Mastercard executives fielded questions about the impact on the company of bank card issuer Capital One shifting some debit card business from Mastercard to Discover Financial. Following Cap One\u2019s completion of its acquisition of Discover in May, that conversion for card holders is happening now, but it will be a gradual process, said Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra.\n\n\u201cWe expect this year the net revenue impact to be minimal to our overall company's net revenues,\u201d Mehra said. \u201cThe vast majority of the impact we expect to feel will be next year.\u201d\n\nMiebach noted that the company still expects to continue its credit card ties to Capital One.\n\nWith respect to its second-quarter results, Mastercard reported net income rose 14% to $3.7 billion for the quarter, over the year-earlier period, as revenue climbed 17% to $8.1 billion, according to a company presentation.",

JPMorgan Chase began charging fintechs for consumer data, and other banks could follow suit. Miebach stated Mastercard has not engaged in conversations about paying such fees and will monitor the situation. He also emphasized rising cybersecurity risks, including those from AI-powered fraud. Mastercard expects minimal net revenue impact this year from Capital One shifting some debit card business to Discover Financial.\n\n**Why it matters:** Miebach's preference for consumer-consented data sharing signals Mastercard's strategic alignment with open banking principles. Banks charging for data could challenge the prevailing consensus of free data flow for fintech innovation and data aggregation. This new practice might impact the business models of data aggregators, including Mastercard's acquired Finicity. The Capital One shift represents a direct, though gradual, revenue impact to Mastercard starting next year.\n\n**The big picture:** Open banking allows consumers to easily shift their data between companies, but has faced U.S. regulatory shifts, including a reversed and then softened stance by the administration. Mastercard acquired Finicity in 2020 to advance its ability to provide services related to consumer data in an open banking environment.

This is the suburban Chicago-based company\u2019s second acquisition announcement this month, after saying last week that it would buy the cloud-based payments player LedgerPay.\n\nBuying BlueSnap, which also provides accounts receivables automation, will allow the combined entity to process card-not-present, electronic check and other payments in 47 countries and some 100 different currencies, according to a Friday press release about the transaction. It will also allow for use of embedded invoicing as well as subscription billing and automated reconciliation with real-time dashboards, the release said.\n\nA spokesperson for Tinley Park, Illinois-based Payroc didn\u2019t respond to a question about the purchase price for BlueSnap. The company said it expects the deal to close in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cIntegrating BlueSnap\u2019s orchestration layer with Payroc\u2019s direct-connect network transforms our ability to serve merchants and [independent sales vendors] at scale,\u201d Payroc CEO Jim Oberman said in the release. \u201cThis transaction dramatically expands our global footprint and the breadth of capabilities we can bring to our customers and partners.\u201d\n\nBlueSnap, based in the Boston area, had raised at least $80 million, and at one point had about 200 employees.

It has recently added hundreds of smaller community banks to its network.\n\nExecutives from EWS and the owner banks have appeared before Senate committee panels to explain what the service is doing to prevent fraud, congressional investigations have found that Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams and news outlets have reported that the payment service allowed fraud to proliferate.\n\nMore than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud, an Early Warning Services spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201dThe fact is scams don\u2019t start on Zelle, they start with criminals manipulating people long before dollars move,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe real threat isn\u2019t the payment method. It\u2019s the criminals \u2013 both in the U.S. and increasingly in foreign countries \u2013 exploiting American through texts, DMs and online marketplace scams.\u201d\n\nThe company helped organize the workshops because use of the platform is on the rise, Leonhard said, noting that payment volume on Zelle exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n\nThe four initial workshops are offered free of charge because of Zelle\u2019s financial contribution, Flores said. The company and the group hope to schedule more sessions and other cities in the future.\n\nEarly Warning Services recently pitched Zelle to the U.S. Treasury Department as a viable option for sending money to taxpayers as the federal government considers how to end its use of paper checks.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Zelle Funds Anti-Fraud Workshops Amid Scrutiny and Rising Platform Use\n\n**Key details:** Early Warning Services (EWS) and the non-profit Consumer Action will train community leaders in three major metropolitan areas to spot scams and fraud. Zelle, an EWS peer-to-peer payment service, is funding these free workshops. The workshops, a new focus for Consumer Action, aim to educate vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those speaking Chinese and Spanish. The first session took place in New York City, with others scheduled for Los Angeles, Scottsdale, and an undetermined city in North Carolina.\n\n**Why it matters:** Zelle has faced significant criticism from consumer advocates and lawmakers for purportedly allowing fraud to proliferate on its platform, with congressional investigations citing hundreds of millions in user losses. This initiative indicates Zelle's direct response to these concerns. The company contends that \"scams don\u2019t start on Zelle\" but with criminals manipulating people beforehand, suggesting the payment method is not the real threat. This challenges the prevailing view that Zelle's platform itself is a primary cause of widespread fraud.\n\n**The big picture:** Zelle is a digital payment network widely used by consumers and businesses, recently exceeding $1 trillion in payment volume for the first time in 2024. Its parent company, Early Warning Services (EWS), is owned by seven large banks and has expanded its network to include hundreds of smaller community banks. The company has been under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and consumer groups regarding fraud on its platform. This new initiative is part of an ongoing effort by Zelle to address these fraud concerns and educate users.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   More than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud.\n*   Zelle payment volume exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n*   Congressional investigations found Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams.\n*   Zelle's parent, EWS, is owned by seven big banks.\n*   Four initial workshops are offered free of charge due to Zelle's financial contribution.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Early Warning Services (EWS):** Parent company of Zelle, co-organizing workshops to combat scams.\n*   **Consumer Action:** Non-profit partnering with EWS to train community leaders on fraud prevention.\n*   **Zelle:** Peer-to-peer payment service funding and co-organizing workshops amid fraud scrutiny.\n*   **Denise Leonhard:** Zelle General Manager, discussed the training program and increasing platform usage.\n*   **Anna Flores:** Consumer Action Executive Director, explained workshop focus and collaboration origins.\n*   **Aspen Institute:** Connected Consumer Action and EWS through its national task force on fraud.\n*   **U.S. Treasury Department:** Pitched Zelle as a viable option for sending money to taxpayers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Additional workshops are planned in Los Angeles in September and Scottsdale, Arizona in December.\n*   An undetermined city in North Carolina will hold a workshop in the first quarter of next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Zelle launches workshops to counter fraud concerns, defend platform amid scrutiny.",

These sales shifted it from being significantly company-owned to overwhelmingly franchised.\n\nQdoba is looking to franchising to bolster its growth, with more than 500 units in various stages of development. The investment is intended to speed up the 800-unit chain\u2019s expansion, per the press release.\n\n\u201cWe have been impressed by the progress that Butterfly has made in positioning QDOBA for sustained growth and believe the depth and breadth of the Apollo platform enables us to execute bespoke transactions like this,\u201d said Steve Lessar, Apollo partner and co-head of S3.\n\nQdoba\u2019s unit economics are also growing. According to the chain\u2019s FDD, same-restaurant sales across 377 mature franchised restaurants rose 9.3% in fiscal 2022, 5.8% in FY 2023 and 8.0% in FY 2024.\n\n\u201cGiven this trajectory, we expect to double QDOBA\u2019s system sales over the next five years,\u201d Qdoba CEO John Cywinski, who has led the chain since 2023, said in the press release.\n\nThis sales growth is in keeping with the overall strength of the fast casual segment, though 2025 has not been kind to Qdoba\u2019s largest competitor, Chipotle, which saw same-store sales fall 4% in Q2.\n\nDespite the sales trouble at major brands, the restaurant sector is still drawing investment and M&A interest from major investors and private equity firms.

CFO Ian Borden said the brand\u2019s McCrispy Chicken Strips and Minecraft promotion drove consumer enthusiasm in Q2, while its snack wrap LTO extended the gains in Q3.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe brand\u2019s focus on menu innovation helped it kick the sales trouble that began in mid-year 2024, when pullback by low-income consumers pitched sales growth into negative territory for the first time in years.\n\nSo far in 2025, McDonald\u2019s has announced three new leadership teams focused specifically on chicken, beef, dessert and beverage innovation. Dessert innovation may be of particular urgency for the brand, given the end of McDonald\u2019s nascent Krispy Kreme partnership.\n\nThree recent menu additions have helped the Golden Arches boost sales gains. In July, the chain relaunched its snackwrap LTO after a six-month buzz buildup, helping to kick off renewed chicken competition in the QSR segment. The chain also added the Daily Double cheeseburger to its menu through year\u2019s end, anchoring the higher end of its value menu. Then McDonald\u2019s added McCrispy Chicken Strips to the permanent menu in May.\n\nLater this year, McDonald\u2019s will test a slate of premium beverages at more than 500 stores, with the drinks based on lessons learned from the now-shuttered CosMc\u2019s drinks concept. Those drinks could help the chain capture traffic that\u2019s shifting to afternoon snacking occasions.\n\nCombined with the new dishes, McDonald\u2019s value platforms and loyalty program have helped improve its market position. Kempczinski said the chain\u2019s loyalty users visit the chain 26 times in a year, compared to about 10 visits for non loyalty members. The McValue program, including the $5 Meal Deal, has also driven visits.\n\nTogether, McValue and loyalty account for 50% of restaurant visits in the U.S., Kempczinski said, with relatively little overlap between the two channels. Kempczinski said McDonald\u2019s is looking at its core menu pricing, in concert with franchisees, as it looks to boost frequency among consumers who aren\u2019t using its rewards program or its McValue platform.\n\n\u201cToday, too often, if you're that consumer, you're driving up to the restaurant and you're seeing combo meals could be priced over $10,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cThat absolutely is shaping value perceptions in a negative way. So we've got to get that fixed.\u201d\n\nBut Borden said lower-income consumers remain under macroeconomic strain, with visits by that cohort to QSRs overall down by double digits. Middle- and higher-income consumers have increased their visits to fast food, Borden said. Kempczinski said this consumer weakness is due both to expectations about tariff impacts and the longer term impacts of inflation on consumer disposable income.\n\n\u201cDespite improvements in wage gains, real incomes are down. With the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits,\u201d Kempczinski said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** McDonald's Q2 sales rebound, beating rivals despite consumer strain.\n\n**Key details:**\nMcDonald's U.S. same-store sales increased by 2.5% in Q2 2025, ending its prior negative growth period. The company outperformed its close competitors in both guest count and comparable sales. This broad-based growth was fueled by value offerings, menu innovation like McCrispy Chicken Strips, and the Minecraft promotion. The snack wrap LTO also contributed by extending sales gains into Q3.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nMcDonald's successfully reversed a sales decline that began in mid-2024, attributed to low-income consumer pullback. This performance challenges the broader industry trend of continued weakness in overall QSR traffic, particularly among lower-income consumers. The company's focus on value platforms and loyalty programs appears to be effectively driving visits and outperforming rivals despite macroeconomic strain on some consumer segments. Its strategic initiatives are mitigating what could be a widespread challenge for the quick-service industry.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMcDonald's sales trouble initially emerged in mid-2024, linked to reduced spending by low-income consumers. The overall QSR market continues to face weak traffic, especially from this demographic, whose visits are down double digits. To combat this and negative value perceptions, McDonald's is reviewing core menu pricing, noting that some combo meals can exceed $10. The company is also bolstering its innovation efforts, establishing three new leadership teams dedicated to chicken, beef, dessert, and beverage innovation.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2.5%**: Increase in McDonald's U.S. same-store sales for Q2 2025.\n*   **26 times**: Average annual visits for McDonald's loyalty users.\n*   **10 visits**: Average annual visits for non-loyalty members.\n*   **50%**: Proportion of U.S. restaurant visits accounted for by McValue and loyalty programs.\n*   **Over $10**: Potential price for combo meals, shaping negative value perceptions.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **McDonald\u2019s**: The restaurant chain that reported a 2.5% increase in U.S. same-store sales in Q2 2025.\n*   **Chris Kempczinski**: McDonald's CEO, stating the chain outperformed competitors and discussed consumer trends.\n*   **Ian Borden**: McDonald's CFO, noting specific sales drivers and macroeconomic strain on lower-income consumers.\n*   **Krispy Kreme**: Former partner in McDonald's dessert innovation efforts; their partnership has now ended.\n*   **CosMc\u2019s**: A drinks concept whose learned lessons will inform McDonald's upcoming premium beverage tests.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   McDonald\u2019s will test a slate of premium beverages at more than 500 stores later this year.\n*   Updates on Q3 performance, as the snack wrap LTO extended gains into that quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMcDonald's Q2 sales rebound with value and innovation despite consumer strain.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nYum Brands again reported divergent results in the U.S. across its major brands. Same-store sales for Taco Bell rose 4%, while KFC and Pizza Hut experienced a 5% drop; and The Habit Burger Grill saw its same-store sales fall by 4%, according to Yum\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings report.\n\nYum saw visits per location \u2014 a useful proxy for traffic \u2014 increase by 0.3%, a significant slowdown from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 1.9% increase, according to data from analytics firm Placer.ai .\n\nYum wants to capitalize on its menu innovation process by expanding the Taco Bell Live Mas Cafe concept to 30 locations by year\u2019s end, outgoing CEO David Gibbs said on the company\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call. Yum will also open several new Saucy locations near KFC\u2019s existing Saucy unit in Orlando later this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s strength was driven by a combination of its menu innovation strategy and digital ordering channels. At least 41% of U.S. Taco Bell orders come through digital channels, and the brand\u2019s loyalty program has grown dramatically \u2014 45% year over year \u2014 Gibbs said.\n\nThe chain's loyalty growth is powered by unique digital activations centered on new menu items like the Mike\u2019s Hot Honey jacket drop, which saw Taco Bell offer 500 jackets to loyalty members in conjunction with the deployment of its Hot Honey Diablo sauce.\n\nGibbs said that Taco Bell is seeing consumers trade down from fast casual, and that the taco chain is experiencing growth across all income bands, even as other QSR giants report weakness with low-income demographics.\n\nKFC, meanwhile, has lagged Taco Bell\u2019s performance in the U.S., though it remains a key profit and growth engine internationally. Gibbs said that the chicken brand has suffered from challenges in the U.S. and parts of Europe that include \u201cgaps in value perception, inconsistent consumer experience and innovation that has not fully resonated with consumers.\u201d Such issues have left the legacy brand vulnerable to rising competitors like Raising Cane\u2019s and Wingstop.\n\nTo address these problems, Yum shifted Scott Mezvinsky from CEO of Taco Bell to KFC earlier this year, and launched new marketing in the U.S. Mezvinsky is using his experience at Taco Bell to help modernize KFC\u2019s brand, Gibbs said, with a strategy focused on \u201cenergizing the brand, enhancing its cultural relevance and deepening consumer engagement worldwide.\u201d\n\nYum\u2019s recent strategy at Taco Bell has hinged on a series of buzzy menu moves. This includes a chicken nugget LTO followed by Crispy Chicken tacos, a new refreshers beverage category, and its combination of value \u2014 $5, $7 and $9 Luxe Cravings boxes \u2014 and premium items like its Cantina Chicken menu. Taco Bell is currently testing potential changes to its value menu, which is currently in a pilot phase in Indianapolis.\n\nIn addition to those menu plays, Yum\u2019s powerful data analytics unit, worldwide reach and wide range of menu categories are helping the company test, deploy and revise a whole host of new beverages meant to capture consumer demand for new flavors and dayparts.\n\nAs KFC looks to become more agile with its marketing and menu innovations, specialized concepts and sub-brands like Saucy and Kwench could come to play a similar role to Taco Bell Cantina, which has helped Yum develop new menu niches and premium products.",

Taco Bell's same-store sales rose 4%, driven by menu innovation and digital channels. In contrast, KFC and Pizza Hut experienced a 5% drop in same-store sales, and The Habit Burger Grill fell 4%. Overall visits per location for Yum slowed significantly to 0.3% growth.\n\n**Why it matters:** This divergence challenges the current consensus that all QSR giants report weakness with low-income demographics, as Taco Bell experienced growth across all income bands. KFC's U.S. struggles, including value perception gaps and innovation that hasn't resonated, leave it vulnerable to rising competitors. Yum's internal leadership shift for KFC signifies a direct effort to address these challenges and modernize a key brand. Investors should note the company's efforts to replicate successful brand strategies.\n\n**The big picture:** Yum Brands is navigating a complex U.S. market where brand performance varies significantly. Taco Bell's strength is attributed to its digital ordering, loyalty program growth, and attracting consumers trading down from fast casual. Meanwhile, KFC faces issues with consistent consumer experience and innovation, prompting strategic changes like shifting Scott Mezvinsky to lead the brand. Yum aims to leverage its data analytics and diverse menu categories to test and deploy new concepts.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Taco Bell same-store sales: +4%\n*   KFC and Pizza Hut same-store sales: -5%\n*   The Habit Burger Grill same-store sales: -4%\n*   Yum visits per location growth: 0.3% (Q2 2025), down from 1.9% (year-ago quarter)\n*   Taco Bell U.S. digital orders: At least 41% of orders\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Yum Brands:** Reported divergent Q2 2025 U.S. brand results across its major restaurants.\n*   **Taco Bell:** Top-performing brand in Q2 with strong same-store sales growth and digital channel strength.\n*   **KFC:** Lagging brand in the U.S. with declining same-store sales, but strong internationally.\n*   **Pizza Hut:** Experienced a 5% drop in U.S. same-store sales in Q2 2025.\n*   **The Habit Burger Grill:** Saw its same-store sales fall by 4% in Q2 2025.\n*   **David Gibbs:** Outgoing Yum CEO who discussed earnings results and brand strategies.\n*   **Placer.ai:** Analytics firm that provided data on Yum's visits per location.\n*   **Raising Cane\u2019s:** Rising competitor to KFC mentioned due to KFC's vulnerability.\n*   **Wingstop:** Rising competitor to KFC mentioned due to KFC's vulnerability.\n*   **Scott Mezvinsky:** Shifted from Taco Bell CEO to KFC CEO to modernize the brand.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Yum plans to expand the Taco Bell Live Mas Cafe concept to 30 locations by year\u2019s end.\n*   Yum will open new Saucy locations near KFC\u2019s existing Saucy unit in Orlando later this year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Yum's U.S. performance is a tale of two brands: Taco Bell strong, others struggling.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nPhilz Coffee will be acquired by private equity firm Freeman Spogli, with the transaction expected to close Aug. 6, the companies announced Monday .\n\nThe 77-unit coffee chain will continue to operate under the leadership of CEO Mahesh Sadarangani, who joined the brand in 2021, according to the press release.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but Mission Local, a San Francisco-based news outlet, reported last week that Philz was in the process of selling itself for about $145 million.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFreeman Spogli has invested in a number of restaurant concepts over the years, according to the press release, including El Pollo Loco, Popeyes and First Watch.\n\nSadarangani said that this restaurant investment experience made the private equity firm an ideal partner for the coffee chain, which is looking to expand its store count. Philz has been backed by private equity of some kind for more than a decade and the acquisition is not a major change for the brand, according to an FAQ website Philz set up about the acquisition.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure all employees that we have no plans to make any changes to the team. It is expected that benefits, pay, raises, hours, and promotions will continue as the company has operated historically,\u201d the coffee chain wrote\n\nAccording to the FAQ, the company \u201cwill be paying a thank you bonus to each and every team member in our stores, roasting facility, and home office.\u201d A number of former employees \u2014 10 according to the FAQ \u2014 will lose the value of stock purchased at a higher price some years ago. The size of the thank you bonus was not disclosed.\n\n\u201cThere are no plans to close stores, and in fact we have an exciting pipeline of new store openings planned over the next 24 months,\u201d Philz wrote.\n\n2025 has seen a relatively high level of restaurant M&A activity, despite the macroeconomic headwinds buffeting the industry. Since the start of June:\n\nWith Darden considering a sale of its troubled Bahama Breeze brand and Jack in the Box exploring strategic alternatives for Del Taco, the summer of 2025 could end up being an exceptionally busy time for the restaurant industry in terms of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nSuch investor appetite for the industry comes at an interesting moment. Same-store sales for many major chains are down, and real estate transactions \u2014 especially for casual dining brands \u2014 remain depressed. With recent major downward revisions to employment projections, looming tariff trouble and consumer reticence yielding lower tips, it\u2019s unclear how long investor interest in new concepts will remain strong. If economic trouble becomes serious enough, it\u2019s likely that more M&A deals will involve devalued assets, as seen in Hooters of America\u2019s recent sale.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhile brands like Texas Roadhouse and Olive Garden continue to thrive, many casual dining chains have halted expansion, closed stores or filed for bankruptcy, leaving a glut of former restaurant properties with few buyers.\n\nCasual dining real estate is in a major slowdown, as property sale success rates have plummeted from 72% in 2021 to just 37% in 2024, according to data from Northmarq, a commercial real estate firm. This decline is primarily driven by fundamental mismatches between available properties and the changing needs of restaurants, which make it increasingly challenging to repurpose former casual dining locations.\n\nThe dramatic decline reflects economic headwinds that have reshaped the restaurant landscape, from the lasting impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior to rising labor costs and the growth of fast casual dining, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\n\"It's definitely a nationwide trend,\" said Matt Lipson, senior vice president and co-founder of the national restaurant group at Northmarq. \"Beyond a few exceptions, there's just this clear drop off.\"\n\nSize mismatches are driving conversion problems\n\nThere\u2019s a fundamental size mismatch between available casual dining properties and what growing restaurant chains actually need as brands, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, look to downsize. A typical Red Lobster location averages about 7,600 square feet on 1.68 acres, while a Chipotle operates in just over 2,400 square feet on 0.99 acres, Northmarq data shows.\n\nAccording to Lipson, most fast casual chains won\u2019t consider retrofitting casual dining properties because they don\u2019t meet their rigid site selection criteria.\n\nThat\u2019s because the conversion costs are high: Tenant improvements can run $200 per square foot, Lipson said, making a Red Lobster conversion too expensive for smaller-format concepts.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of cases, it's easier just to knock down the building and have a developer split it up,\u201d said David Orkin, executive vice president and restaurant practice leader for the Americas at CBRE. He said landlords are increasingly dividing properties into multiple smaller spaces.\n\nMany older restaurant buildings are essentially worthless to new casual dining tenants, as well. Orkin cited a recent example where his team discovered an old Macaroni Grill \u201chad negative value\u201d once they began to analyze construction costs, with renovation costs exceeding those of demolition and reconstruction.\n\nA closed TGI Fridays in Leesburg, Virginia, as seen on Dec. 28, 2024. Julie Littman/Restaurant Dive\n\nEconomic pressures compound challenges\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered consumer dining habits while devastating the finances of many full-service operators. Even as restrictions lifted, fear of dining out persisted, and revenue collapses led to casual dining closures that have created lasting negative perceptions.\n\n\u201cEvery time there's bankruptcy news \u2014 and there's a lot of it \u2014 or every time there's store closure news, it starts passing on to the other brands,\u201d Lipson said. \u201cIt affects consumer behavior, because there's just so much bad news around these places.\u201d\n\nRising labor costs have also had a significant impact on casual dining operations, which typically require 25 or more staff members \u2014 far more than a typical fast casual or quick-service restaurant, Lipson said. Minimum wage increases that might be manageable for a fast casual or drive-thru concept can be crushing for full-service restaurants operating on razor-thin margins.\n\nHigher construction costs have also made new builds more expensive, and restaurants are moving toward smaller footprints in response, according to Lipson. The average new quick-serve restaurant build has decreased from 3,000 square feet in 2016 to approximately 2,200 square feet today, with many operators switching to 950-square-foot modular buildings that focus entirely on drive-thru service, according to Lipson.\n\nMarket dynamics favor the strongest players\n\nThe construction slowdown has created a market of haves and have-nots, where the strongest casual dining brands can cherry-pick premium locations.\n\n\u201cThere is no one to take those B, C, D sites,\u201d Lipson said.\n\nLess desirable properties often sell to non-restaurant buyers, such as car dealerships, looking to expand. That\u2019s because cap rates \u2014 which calculate a property\u2019s ROI by dividing its net operating income by its asset value \u2014 rose significantly as interest rates climbed, further depressing property values and making it harder to make deals.\n\nAt the same time, some quick-service restaurants are competing directly with casual dining for prime real estate. New Chick-fil-A locations require nearly 1.6 acres, compared with one acre, historically, and larger margins allow them to pay higher rents than casual dining brands, Lipson said.\n\nWendellandCarolyn via Getty Images\n\nSigns of recovery emerge\n\nDespite the issues, there are reasons for optimism. Development activity is \u201cturning back on pretty aggressively\u201d in 2025 as sales rebound, Orkin said.\n\n\u201cRight now, it's actually pretty vibrant,\u201d Orkin said, noting that the struggles are often brand-specific rather than industry-wide. \u201cThere are a lot of older, tired brands that have kind of lost their relevance. Those are the ones that are kind of struggling.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly because millennials are returning to casual dining as they age, after driving the growth of fast casual restaurants earlier in their lives.\n\n\u201cThese millennials are having families, right? And so their shopping patterns, their lives are different, and they're going to start doing what their parents did,\u201d Orkin said.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t offered much solace to landlords who now regret investing in casual dining real estate.\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cjust like, \u2018Oh my, I could have bought anything else in the world,\u2019\u201d Lipson said.",

Competition has also grown more intense, including from newcomers \u201clike Lovisa offering younger shoppers a more sophisticated assortment at value prices,\u201d he said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe chain has been swamped by a cocktail of problems, both internal and external, that made it impossible to stay afloat,\u201d he said. \u201cMost recently, tariffs have pushed costs higher, and Claire\u2019s is not in a position to manage this effectively.\u201d\n\nThis bankruptcy is an opportunity to reset by closing underperforming stores and lowering debt, but \u201creinventing will be a tall order in the present environment,\u201d according to Saunders.\n\nIndeed, retailers returning to bankruptcy multiple times are more likely to throw in the towel, Foss said, citing, along with Forever 21, Joann, Party City and Rue21.\n\n\u201cBankruptcy can be a good option for a struggling retail chain, allowing it to refocus, trim its debt, and slim down its retail footprint,\u201d Foss said. \u201cHowever, retailers that have emerged from Chapter 11 only to file again a few years later often find themselves liquidating and shutting their doors entirely, with some kind of online presence remaining.\u201d\n\nClaire\u2019s runs more than 2,750 namesake stores in 17 countries in North America and Europe plus 190 Icing stores in North America.

The tool is now in use in the U.K., and Ebay is expanding AI-personalized emails to use cases including abandoned carts.\n\n\u201cWe're already sending millions of these tailored emails each week and plan to continue leveraging generative AI to personalize more touch points of the customer experience through CRM channels,\u201d Iannone said.\n\nAgentic AI also represents a significant opportunity to improve personalization and relevance, according to Iannone. One example of the company\u2019s investments is the conversational AI shopping agent Ebay rolled out to a small number of customers in May.\n\nWhile agentic commerce is a small part of the business right now, \u201cit has a nice growth rate,\u201d Iannone said.\n\n\u201cSo ultimately, we believe our scale, our unique inventory and our differentiated value proposition as well as accelerating our own AI capabilities position us extremely well to thrive in an agentic commerce future,\u201d Iannone said during the call.\n\nWhile agentic AI may play a larger role in shopping experiences in years to come, the technology still faces some hurdles. For instance, about 2 in 5 consumers say they have no trust in AI shopping assistants, according to a YouGov survey.\n\nWhile AI is a major focus, Iannone described Ebay\u2019s strategy as multipronged, and Ebay Live is another key element of its overall approach.\n\n\u201cBy layering live commerce on top of our scaled marketplace, we're creating new shopping experiences where sellers can connect directly with their audience and like-minded buyers can engage with each other, all while leveraging the sellers, inventory and demand we already have,\u201d Iannone said.\n\nEbay\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2025 exceeded expectations, with revenue up 4% year over year on an FX-neutral basis to $2.7 billion, according to a company earnings report.\n\n\u201cThese results are a testament to our continued progress in reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts,\u201d Iannone said.",

The company also continues to invest in Ebay Live, its live shopping platform introduced in 2022.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is embracing grit and humor with a new multiseason ad campaign that arrives nearly a year after the outdoor apparel maker revamped its marketing leadership and agency roster, per news shared with sister publication Marketing Dive.\n\n\u201cEngineered for Whatever,\u201d part of Columbia\u2019s first brand platform relaunch in a decade, leverages dark humor to demonstrate the durability of its gear. The titular 30-second spot begins with a hiker stopping to smell the flowers before getting jumped by a snake, setting the tone for a narrative that shows people in peril.\n\nColumbia also enlisted real stunt performers to put its goods to the test in hairy situations, such as dangling above predator-infested waters. Beyond the video ads, the company is refreshing its visual identity with a new typeface, logo lockup, color palette and touch-ups for other assets appearing across retail, social and digital channels.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nColumbia is taking notes from \u201cJackass\u201d and \u201c127 Hours\u201d with a campaign that mixes laughs with a tough-as-nails attitude. The revamped messaging and visual identity follow the brand appointing new marketing leadership in October, with Matthew Sutton joining the outdoor company as head of marketing. Around the same time, Columbia named Adam&eveDDB as its global agency of record following a competitive review.\n\n\u201cEngineered for Whatever\u201d aims to position 87-year-old Columbia as a disruptor in a category that tends to portray the great outdoors as \u201cpristine and perfect,\u201d executives said. The brand had seen a sales recovery in recent quarters after a period of flagging consumer demand but is now grappling with the impact of tariffs. One of its goals has been to bring product strategy and marketing closer together to raise awareness for proprietary technology innovations like its Omni-Heat, Omni-Max, Omni-Shade and Omni-Freeze offerings.\n\nThe new campaign puts that mandate into action with ads depicting heightened versions of the intense testing Columbia goods undergo. Those trials include: being chased by desert vultures and the literal Grim Reaper; enduring temperatures so cold they crack teeth; and face-planting in the mud on a trail run. A thrash metal cover of the usually dreamy \u201cBlue Skies\u201d serves as the soundtrack.\n\n\u201cSome people think nature is like this,\u201d an opening narration says over footage of a hiker stopping to appreciate the flowers on an idyllic trail. \u201cIt\u2019s actually like this,\u201d the narrator continues as a snake suddenly shoots out from the brush to bite the hiker.\n\nThe commercial features an appearance by mountaineer Aron Ralston, who again finds himself trapped between a canyon and a falling boulder, a situation that led him to cut off part of his right arm in 2003. The harrowing predicament inspired his autobiography, \u201cBetween a Rock and a Hard Place,\u201d which was later adapted into the feature film \u201c127 Hours.\u201d Henry-Alex Rubin directed \u201cEngineered for Whatever,\u201d with production by Smuggler.\n\n\"By embracing the real and unexpected sides of adventure, we\u2019re staying true to our legacy and charting a distinct and memorable path for our brand going forward,\u201d said Columbia marketing head Sutton in a statement.\n\nA separate video, releasing later in August, shows off the durability of Columbia\u2019s ROC pants by having a stunt performer dangle over waters teeming with alligators, his lifeline to a helicopter made up of multiple pairs of the pants tied together. Future stunt-oriented creative will show people strapped to a snowplow to promote Columbia\u2019s Omni-Heat Infinity technology and tumbling down a mountain slope in a snowball while keeping warm with the brand\u2019s puffer jackets.\n\nIn addition, Columbia is running out-of-home ads that carry the same throughline of punchy humor. Social, display, audio and connected TV elements round out the media plan.\n\nThe marketing effort is one part of a broader strategy to attract younger and more active consumers, which includes several shifts to the activewear company\u2019s brand, product and marketplace approach.\n\nColumbia Sportswear's sales increased 6% in the second quarter, the company announced last week. However, sales were down 2% in the U.S., which was offset by growth in international markets. The company expects tariffs to put pressure on sales going forward.",

The survey was conducted between May 20 and June 4, and U.S. tariff policies have continued to change weekly since then.\n\nAlmost half of retail buyers noted they plan to source from new vendors, while a smaller amount aim to negotiate better terms with suppliers or increase domestic sourcing. In recent months, several retail companies (such as Target, Best Buy and Warby Parker) have expressed mitigation efforts related to tariffs that include sourcing from new countries, particularly outside China.\n\nAdditionally, 76% of the surveyed retail buyers expect consumers to buy discretionary goods only around promotional periods. The new insight adds to a June report from Deloitte that found price-conscious consumers anticipate spending 40% to 50% less this year on discretionary goods.\n\nData from Inmar Intelligence released in July found that consumers are certainly looking toward holiday promotions to fuel discretionary gifts \u2014 even at the expense of other purchases.

Despite early ordering, 78% worry about inventory and 76% about supplier reliability due to geopolitical tensions. Some buyers have paused shipments (20%) or canceled unprofitable orders (18%) as trade policies evolve. They also expect consumers to buy discretionary goods primarily during promotional periods.\n\n**Why it matters:** These findings highlight retailers' deep concerns regarding inventory, supplier reliability, and the rapidly changing trade landscape ahead of the holiday shopping season. Retailers are actively adapting by leveraging AI and placing orders much earlier, yet concerns about profitability are leading to paused or canceled orders. The expectation that consumers will only buy discretionary goods during promotions, coupled with consumers cutting back on essentials for holiday purchases, signals a highly price-sensitive market.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nTraffic to malls run by Simon Property Group is up 1.5%, but footfall is weak along the U.S. border and in areas that usually benefit from tourism, CEO David Simon told analysts Monday.\n\nThe decline undermines an otherwise strong portfolio, which is outpacing U.S. malls overall, according to research from Jefferies analysts led by Linda Tsai, released last month. June mall foot traffic fell 2.7% year over year, after rising 4.6% in May, with Simon Property Group enjoying the strongest performance, followed by Macerich and Tanger, Jefferies found.\n\nThe malls experiencing declines or stagnation otherwise \u201cprovide pretty healthy sales growth,\u201d Simon said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't really matter whether it's an outlet or a full-price mall, but it's assets that are on the border, north or south,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's almost irrelevant, whether it's Canadian border or the Mexican border. ... And I would also say we're not seeing the benefit that normally you might see from a weaker U.S. dollar.\u201d\n\nWalmart similarly noted \u201csome traffic shifts in February and June, aligning with headlines concerning the Hispanic consumer,\u201d Jefferies analysts led by Corey Tarlowe said in July. Earlier this year, several analysts noted that spending is down at off-price stores near the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nNearly 20% of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic, and in the past 15 years, the demographic has grown faster than any other \u2014 driving almost half of the country\u2019s total population growth, according to research from Kantar. This is a consumer bloc whose spending power outpaces non-Hispanic spending and represents GDP of $3.2 trillion. As a group, their finances are strong, \u201cwith more discretionary income, greater savings, and less concern over essential costs compared to all shoppers,\u201d according to Kantar\u2019s report.\n\nBut brick-and-mortar shopping is down significantly among Hispanic shoppers compared to last year, which the firm attributes in part to immigration policy.\n\n\u201cDespite this relative optimism, in-store shopping remains subdued, signaling that economic strain is not the primary barrier,\u201d Kantar said. \u201cThis disconnect suggests other forces, such as heightened concerns around safety, belonging, or cultural relevance, may be driving the pullback from physical retail.\u201d",

This localized decline undermines an otherwise strong portfolio, which outpaces U.S. malls overall. The affected assets are primarily on the Canadian or Mexican borders, regardless of being outlet or full-price malls. The company is also not experiencing the usual benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe localized traffic weakness challenges Simon Property Group's otherwise strong portfolio performance. This decline is linked to traffic shifts among Hispanic consumers and immigration policy, not primarily economic strain. This challenges the consensus view that the large and financially strong Hispanic consumer bloc's spending decisions in brick-and-mortar retail are solely driven by economic factors. Instead, it suggests other forces like safety, belonging, or cultural relevance may be impacting their in-store shopping.\n\n**The big picture:**\nOverall U.S. mall foot traffic fell 2.7% year over year in June, after a 4.6% rise in May. Simon Property Group still had the strongest performance among U.S. malls, followed by Macerich and Tanger. Nearly 20% of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic, a demographic that has driven almost half of the country's total population growth in the past 15 years.

The online home furnishings company reported a Q2 net income of $15 million, up from a loss of $42 million last year, and an operating income of $17 million, from a loss of $35 million a year ago.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s net revenue grew 5% year over year to $3.3 billion. Excluding the impact from its exit from the German market, Wayfair\u2019s net revenue increased 6%. U.S. revenues grew 5.3%, while international revenues were up 3.1%.\n\nThe company\u2019s active customer base, however, declined 4.5% from the year-ago period. Orders per customer grew slightly, from 1.85 to 1.86.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCEO Niraj Shah declared Wayfair\u2019s second quarter \u201ca resounding success,\u201d noting that the period \u201cwas a nice proof point of the journey that we've been on and even more exciting of what is to come.\u201d\n\nThe home retailer turned a quarterly profit for the first time in four years, even as the broader home market remains challenged. Jefferies analysts led by Jonathan Matuszewski highlighted Wayfair\u2019s potential \u201cthat stronger sales could unlock substantially-higher margins.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine what's ahead when housing cooperates,\u201d Matuszewski said in a Monday note.\n\nWhile retailers in the home sector have experienced lower demand in recent years, some retailers saw a lift more recently as consumers pulled purchases forward as fears of tariffs \u2014 and potential price increases \u2014 loomed.\n\nBut Wayfair hasn\u2019t experienced noticeable changes in its customers\u2019 buying habits, executives said Monday, and Shah touted the company\u2019s marketplace model, which has allowed its prices to remain largely unchanged.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace forces of our inventory-light model give us unmatched flexibility. \u2026 The benefits of this model continue to prove self-evident despite the various ebbs and flows of the broad business environment,\u201d he said, adding that prices across the items consumers are currently purchasing are relatively consistent with those from the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cThe momentum feels to us, driven by the structural business initiatives, not by any one-time events, any unique pull forward, anything like that. And that momentum is continuing,\u201d CFO Kate Gulliver said on Monday\u2019s call with analysts.\n\nWayfair in recent months has launched a number of initiatives, including its Wayfair Verified tool and paid loyalty program. The company has also been steadily building out its brick-and-mortar footprint across its various banners. Wayfair\u2019s first large-format store \u2014 which opened just over a year ago in Wilmette, Illinois, outside of Chicago \u2014 has helped drive purchases in less-frequented categories for the retailer. The company said it has seen a 50% increase in lower-ticket items like kitchen accessories purchases and a more than 35% increase in home improvement purchases, including bathroom renovation items and kitchen cabinets. Wayfair has plans to expand its large-format concept to Denver, Atlanta and Yonkers, New York.",

The brand\u2019s first retail concept will open in Raleigh, North Carolina, in October.\n\nMaeve currently has dedicated retail space within Anthropologie\u2019s stores and has become the top-searched brand on Anthropologie\u2019s website over the past year. Its product assortment \u201cblends timeless silhouettes with modern details,\u201d features plus, petite, tall and adaptive options, and targets a \u201cmultigenerational audience,\u201d according to Anthropologie.\n\nTo kick off the launch, Anthropologie is rolling out a robust marketing strategy. This includes an ad campaign across digital and physical channels, a Maeve catalog that will be shipped to top customers, a Substack newsletter, and an in-person event in New York City featuring a mock store preview and product unveilings.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs an owned brand, Maeve became a growth driver and developed a loyal customer base, which sowed the seeds for this transition, according to Anthropologie. Over the past year, almost 2 million customers have shopped Maeve products and the brand has accumulated more than 10 million TikTok views, per the release.\n\n\u201cIts consistent performance, combined with our customers\u2019 emotional connection to the brand, made this the right moment to evolve Maeve into a stand-alone identity,\u201d Anu Narayanan, president of women\u2019s and home at Anthropologie Group, said in a statement. \u201cOur customers have helped shape Maeve into what it is today and shown us time and again that the label holds a special place in both their wardrobes and their lives.\u201d\n\nPrior to introducing Maeve as a stand-alone brand, Anthropologie has expanded in other ways. In January, the retailer unveiled resortwear line Celandine, complete with swimwear, cover-ups, dresses, accessories and beauty products. Two months later, Anthropologie partnered with Universal Standard to create a 13-piece collection, including shirts, jeans, a jumpsuit and dresses.\n\nThose efforts are paying off, according to Frank Conforti, COO and co-president of parent company Urban Outfitters Inc. On an earnings call with analysts in May, Conforti noted that both brick-and-mortar and digital channels drove growth for Anthropologie and praised the segment\u2019s product assortment.\n\n\u201cThe team at Anthropologie continues to do an excellent job with their strategy to expand their product offerings to fit their customers\u2019 full lifestyle,\u201d Conforti said, adding that the launch of Celandine had already \u201cexceeded our expectations. Alongside Celandine, Daily Practice and the expanded assortment of intimates and loungewear are also seeing impressive growth, and we believe these could become significant categories in the future.\u201d\n\nAnthropologie\u2019s net sales in the quarter rose 8.3% year over year, with comparable sales up 6.9%.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWaymo plans to bring its robotaxi service to Washington, D.C., next year and is testing autonomous operations with safety drivers in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia, all cities that can experience harsh winter weather. Until now, Waymo has mainly limited its operations to cities with milder climates: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco and Austin, Texas. These expansions could show how well its self-driving cars handle snow, ice and long, dark nights.\n\n\u201cMoving to places that have profoundly different weather [will] have a big implication\u201d for safety and operational capability, Ben Bauchwitz, a scientist in human-centered AI at Charles River Analytics, said. The company conducts research on AI and related fields.\n\nBauchwitz said it\u2019s crucial for Waymo to collect \u201cfour seasons of data in the Northeast\u201d before carrying paid riders. Last winter, the robotaxi company tested vehicles in upstate New York, Michigan and Truckee, California, a small town nearly 6,000 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\n\u201cSafety is all about the things you didn't think were going to happen but happened anyway,\u201d Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor emeritus and safety expert in autonomous vehicles, said in a January interview.\n\nEran Ofir, CEO at Imagry, an AV software company, acknowledged that Waymo will face \u201cweather conditions that they haven't met in the West.\u201d These include snow, ice, black ice, high winds, long dark nights and low sun angles in winter that can blind onboard cameras, he said.\n\nEthan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said in an email the company is \u201cmaking great progress\u201d in developing the capability to drive safely in winter weather. \u201cIn the immediate future, we would treat snowfall much like any other cautious driver would and pause operations if weather conditions are outside of the scope of our technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe currently operate in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, and Atlanta, so we already see heavy rain, thick fog, bright sun, and dust and ice storms.\u201d\n\nA Waymo robotaxi stopped at a light along a street on March 14, 2024 in Los Angeles. Mario Tama via Getty Images\n\nHow AVs see the road\n\nWaymo\u2019s autonomous vehicles rely on multiple types of sensors, including cameras, radar and lidar. Before launching robotaxi service in a new city, Waymo sends out its vehicles, with human drivers, to create detailed maps of the area it plans to serve. The result, according to Bauchwitz, is that \u201cyou're generally going to have at least one sensor stream that can penetrate any kind of weather at any given time.\u201d\n\nSince 2023, Tesla vehicles have only used cameras for their Autopilot system. CEO Elon Musk insists its cameras and artificial intelligence are the \u201cdigital equivalent of eyes and a brain.\u201d\n\nSome experts disagree, noting that Tesla\u2019s advanced driver assistance systems require a human driver to monitor the vehicle\u2019s actions and be ready to take control at all times.\n\nOfir was more confident in Tesla vehicles\u2019 ability to operate in winter weather conditions. Autonomous vehicles that rely on maps may encounter issues in winter storms, he said, whereas Tesla\u2019s AI system \u201cis getting cues from all kinds of objects\u201d in the surrounding area, and it understands what it is seeing \u2014 \u201cthe same way that we would process\u201d the scene.\n\nVehicles with multiple sensor types need to compare and contrast the incoming data, Ofir said, which can delay its reaction time. Imagry has real-world experience in this, he said, from running three pilot programs in Israel with autonomous buses using mapless technology. He said the system can respond to events in less than 100 milliseconds, \u201cat least three times better than a trained driver.\u201d\n\nWaymo uses AI and machine learning as well as sensors to perceive the environment, predict the behavior of road users and navigate in real time. The company\u2019s next-generation architecture will push the \u201ccutting-edge capabilities and the boundaries of AI even further,\u201d it says in an Oct. 31, 2024, document.\n\nWhere Waymo could encounter tricky winter weather\n\nWaymo \u201cis going to be ready for riders in Washington, D.C., next year,\u201d Teicher said. Earlier this year, Waymo returned to the nation\u2019s capital for more testing, after an initial round in 2024, to prepare for upcoming robotaxi operations there. Waymo also announced plans to begin serving Dallas next year. While Texas is in the Sun Belt, Dallas winters can feature freezing temperatures, wind, sleet and snow.\n\nThe company began testing in New York City with human drivers in July. It applied for a permit to operate ride-hailing service in the city, but New York state law prevents it from operating without a driver. Waymo also began testing in Philadelphia in July.\n\nBoston saw Waymo robotaxis on its streets in May and June, but the service faces \u201ca deep skepticism, if not outright hostility\u201d from local leaders, according to one media report. At a July 24 city council hearing, officials from Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration and some council members expressed concerns about autonomous vehicles operating in the area, according to Boston.com.\n\n\u201cOur streets are narrower in many parts of the city. Our streets do not conform to a typical grid,\u201d Jascha Franklin-Hodge, Boston\u2019s chief of streets, said at the council hearing. \u201cWe have one of the highest rates of pedestrian and cyclist usage in the city relative to other cities around the country, which creates a whole extra set of risks and complexities for a vehicle.\u201d\n\nConcerned about snow, ice and sleet, City Council Member Sharon Durkan, chair of the Planning, Development and Transportation Committee, asked Waymo representatives at the hearing, \u201cAre there cases where \u2026 a driverless car may make the decision to go out in an unsafe situation?\u201d\n\nWaymo has mostly served cities like Los Angeles with milder weather. Mario Tama via Getty Images\n\nWaymo\u2019s robotaxis \u201cnot yet validated\u201d for snow\n\nDavid Margines, a director of product management at Waymo, said the company is testing its autonomous driving technology, which it calls the \u201cWaymo driver,\u201d in snowy environments, adding, \u201cWe have not yet validated the Waymo driver for fully driverless operations in things like snow and standing snow on the ground.\u201d\n\nBauchwitz said Waymo needs to learn the physics \u201cthat will predict how driving inputs are going to react in different kinds of snow.\u201d\n\nWaymo has also gotten pushback from organized labor in Boston. Teamsters Local 25 is asking for an ordinance to study the impact AVs will have on the economy, traffic and public safety. \u201cWaymo is steamrolling into cities throughout our country without concern for workers or residents. They\u2019re doing this because they want to make trillions of dollars by eliminating jobs,\u201d Tom Mari, the local\u2019s president, said in a July 25 statement.\n\nFranklin-Hodge expressed additional concerns, including Waymo vehicles\u2019 possible interference with emergency vehicles, double parking when picking up or discharging passengers, navigating through construction work zones and empty vehicles adding to congestion on the city\u2019s streets. Legislation to establish a regulatory framework for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles is under consideration in the state house.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation released a new AV framework in April that aims to spur innovation for autonomous vehicles and \u201cprevent a harmful patchwork of state laws and regulations,\u201d it said in a news release.\n\nDespite the testing, it may be a while before Bostonians can ride in a driverless Waymo robotaxi. \u201cWaymo has no official plans at this time for a commercial launch in Boston,\u201d Matthew Walsh, regional head of state and local policy, East, for Waymo, said at the hearing.",

A Waymo director confirmed they have not yet validated fully driverless operations in snow.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis expansion into harsher weather challenges Waymo's current operational model, which has primarily succeeded in milder climates. It will demonstrate how well self-driving cars handle snow, ice, long dark nights, and low sun angles that can blind cameras. Successfully navigating these new environments could challenge the consensus that autonomous vehicles are only viable in warm, predictable areas, potentially unlocking larger markets. This also highlights differing sensor approaches, contrasting Waymo's multiple sensors with Tesla's camera-only system.\n\n**The big picture:**\nUntil now, Waymo has mainly operated in cities with milder climates such as San Francisco and Austin, Texas. Moving to places with profoundly different weather has \"big implication\" for safety and operational capability, according to experts. It is considered crucial for Waymo to collect \"four seasons of data in the Northeast\" before carrying paid riders, having tested in upstate New York and Michigan last winter. Waymo's vehicles rely on multiple sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, to perceive the environment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Truckee, California, where Waymo tested: nearly 6,000 feet above sea level.\n*   Imagry's system reaction time: less than 100 milliseconds.\n*   Imagry's system speed: at least three times better than a trained driver.\n*   Boston City Council hearing discussing AVs: July 24.\n*   Teamsters Local 25 statement regarding Waymo: July 25.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Waymo:** Autonomous vehicle company expanding robotaxi service to new, challenging weather cities.\n*   **Ben Bauchwitz (Charles River Analytics):** AI scientist stating harsh weather implies safety challenges and requires four seasons of data.\n*   **Philip Koopman (Carnegie Mellon University):** Safety expert noting autonomous vehicle safety involves preparing for unexpected occurrences.\n*   **Eran Ofir (Imagry):** CEO of AV software firm, discussed new weather challenges and Tesla's camera-only AV approach.\n*   **Ethan Teicher (Waymo):** Spokesperson stating Waymo is progressing in winter driving, will pause operations if conditions extreme.\n*   **David Margines (Waymo):** Director stating Waymo driver not yet validated for fully driverless operations in snow.\n*   **Elon Musk:** Tesla CEO confident in camera-only Autopilot system as digital eyes and brain.\n*   **Jascha Franklin-Hodge (Boston's chief of streets):** Boston official raising concerns about AVs navigating city's narrow streets and high pedestrian use.\n*   **Sharon Durkan (Boston City Council Member):** Council member concerned about driverless cars making unsafe decisions in winter weather.\n*   **Tom Mari (Teamsters Local 25):** Union president concerned Waymo is \"steamrolling\" cities, eliminating jobs without local consideration.\n*   **Matthew Walsh (Waymo):** Regional policy head stating no official plans for commercial Waymo launch in Boston.\n*   **Tesla:** Company using only cameras for Autopilot, whose CEO believes in its AI capabilities.\n*   **Imagry:** AV software company whose CEO highlighted Waymo's challenges and their own fast mapless system.\n*   **Charles River Analytics:** Research company whose scientist commented on Waymo's operational implications in new climates.\n*   **Teamsters Local 25:** Organized labor group requesting an ordinance to study AV impact on jobs and public safety.\n*   **U.S. Department of Transportation:** Released new AV framework aiming to spur innovation and prevent state regulatory differences.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Waymo plans to bring robotaxi service to Washington D.C. and Dallas next year.\n*   New York state law currently prevents Waymo from operating ride-hailing service without a driver.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWaymo\u2019s expansion into cold weather tests AV tech, faces regulatory and climate hurdles.",

        "summary_text": "City and county officials across the country list housing affordability as a top priority. If they were looking for a year of predictability, 2025 has not been it.\n\nUncertainty surrounding the economy and the future of federal housing assistance has exacerbated the nation\u2019s \u201calready-enormous housing challenges,\u201d according to the \u201cState of the Nation\u2019s Housing 2025\u201d report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.\n\nThe report, published in June, found that home prices across the country are up 60% since 2019 \u2014 and rising. Here are five takeaways from the report for local government leaders.\n\n1. Unaffordability is reaching record highs\n\nThe median existing single-family home price hit a record high of $412,000 in 2024 \u2014 five times the median household income, according to JCHS. Subsequently, existing home sales have plunged, with just 4 million homes sold last year, the lowest number since 1995.\n\nRenting has also become increasingly burdensome, with a record 50% of renters spending more than half their income on rent in 2023. The issue is widespread, with the share of cost-burdened renters increasing in 43 states and in 89 of the country\u2019s largest metro areas between 2019 and 2023.\n\n2. Homeownership is declining\n\nHomeownership rates declined in 2024 for the first time since 2016, falling to 65.6%, according to JCHS. They fell again in the first quarter of 2025, to 65.1%.\n\nThe largest decline in homeownership \u2014 by 1.4% in 2024 \u2014 was among households led by people under the age of 35.\n\nHomelessness also reached record highs in 2024, surging 33% since January 2020.\n\n3. State and local governments will need to play a larger role\n\nIn May, the Trump administration announced plans to slash around $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget, diminishing housing aid that states and local governments have come to rely on.\n\n\u201cLooking forward, state and local governments will undoubtedly play a larger role in addressing record-breaking housing needs as the federal government contemplates the withdrawal of vital supports,\u201d the JCHS report states.\n\nNationwide, more than 800 local government housing trust funds and 350 municipal rental assistance programs have been set up to finance affordable housing, according to JCHS.\n\nHowever, if the federal government moves forward with proposed cutbacks, local leaders will face difficult spending decisions. \u201cThe federal government underpins many state and local programs, and the scale of that funding and assistance will be nearly impossible to replace,\u201d according to JCHS.\n\n4. Finding ways to increase housing supply is \u2018critical\u2019\n\nIncreasing new housing supply \u201cremains critical for alleviating affordability pressures and stimulating economic growth,\u201d the JCHS report states. It recommends local governments explore multiple methods to unlock additional housing development, including:\n\nImplementing zoning reforms.\n\nRevisiting restrictive land-use policies.\n\nCreating financing tools for developers.\n\nProviding design assistance for \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing types, such as accessory dwelling units and small multifamily buildings.\n\n\u201cContinued innovations by state and local governments regarding housing policies, regulations and financing models will help\" address housing needs, the report states.\n\n5. Climate disasters are a growing risk for housing\n\nIncreasingly severe and frequent climate disasters represent a growing risk to housing supply in 2025, according to the report. Damages from climate-related disasters in 2024 amounted to more than $180 billion.\n\nHurricane Helene in the Southeast in 2024 and the Palisades and Eaton wildfires in Southern California earlier this year severely damaged or destroyed more than 20,000 homes. More than 61 million homes in the U.S. are currently in areas with \u201cat least moderate hazard risk,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of disasters, homes may be destroyed and rents can rise as displaced households seek temporary accommodations from an already-strained stock,\u201d it states.\n\nSuch events are also causing increases in home insurance premiums, which surged 57% from 2019 to 2024, the report states, citing data from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Housing Affordability Crisis Deepens Amid Federal Aid Cuts and Climate Risks\n\n**Key details:** The median existing single-family home price hit a record $412,000 in 2024, five times the median household income. Simultaneously, a record 50% of renters spent over half their income on rent in 2023. Homeownership rates declined in 2024 and Q1 2025, reaching 65.1%. Homelessness also surged 33% since January 2020, reaching record highs. Proposed federal budget cuts to housing aid mean state and local governments will need to play a larger role.\n\n**Why it matters:** The record-high housing costs and declining homeownership exacerbate existing challenges, potentially straining consumer finances. Proposed federal housing aid cuts could force difficult spending decisions for state and local governments, impacting their ability to address housing needs. This shift in responsibility and diminished federal support challenges any view that housing affordability issues are stabilizing or improving, suggesting continued pressure on the sector. Furthermore, increasing climate disaster risks threaten housing supply and drive up home insurance premiums.\n\n**The big picture:** Housing affordability is a top priority for city and county officials nationwide. The \"State of the Nation\u2019s Housing 2025\" report, published in June by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, details worsening conditions. This report indicates that uncertainty regarding the economy and future federal housing assistance is exacerbating the nation\u2019s housing challenges. Overall home prices have risen 60% since 2019, contributing to widespread unaffordability.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$412,000:** Record median existing single-family home price in 2024.\n*   **50%:** Record share of renters spending over half their income on rent in 2023.\n*   **65.1%:** Homeownership rate in Q1 2025, a decline from 2024.\n*   **33%:** Increase in homelessness since January 2020.\n*   **$33 billion:** Proposed cuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University:** Published the \"State of the Nation\u2019s Housing 2025\" report on housing challenges.\n*   **Trump administration:** Proposed slashing $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget.\n*   **U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):** Its budget faces proposed $33 billion cuts, potentially reducing housing aid.\n*   **Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

The biggest rent declines in metros that have boosted housing supply were in low-income areas.\n\n\u201cMaintaining restrictive zoning that exacerbates the housing shortage puts vulnerable tenants in a more precarious position by burdening them with steep rent increases,\u201d the Pew analysis states. \u201cAllowing enough homes for everyone improves affordability overall, but the evidence shows it benefits low-income renters most.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNearly half of renters in the U.S. spend more than 30% of their income on rent and are considered cost-burdened, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nRent increases are connected to the shortfall of as many as 7.1 million rental homes for low-income renters. While high-income renters have options in middle-income areas and middle-income renters can relocate to less expensive options, low-income renters have \u201cnowhere to turn,\u201d according to Pew.\n\nThe impact is acute in large metros with stifled housing development. New York City, for example, increased its housing stock only 4% between 2010 and 2023 despite a 22% surge in jobs during the same period, forcing people out of the city or onto the streets. The U.S. saw a record amount of homelessness in 2024.\n\nRents are rising more slowly \u2014 and even falling \u2014 in cities that have bolstered housing development. Austin, Texas; Denver; San Antonio, Texas; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Dallas all recorded declines in the average rent for low-income renters from 2023 to 2024. These cities have all increased their housing stocks by at least 10% since 2017, according to Pew. Even new luxury or high-end housing developments helped curb rent in low-income areas, the analysis found.\n\n\u201cSo even though most of the new apartments and condominiums built were not subsidized and may have had rents higher than low-income residents could afford, the new supply helped push rents down in older, less-expensive units by reducing the competition among those seeking homes that were no longer as scarce,\u201d according to Pew.\n\nNew Rochelle, New York, took steps starting 10 years ago to increase housing supply and reduce rent by authorizing more than 11,000 housing units over the past decade, with 4,500 of them completed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Median rent in New Rochelle has increased just 1.6% since 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cAffordable housing is not one-size-fits-all,\u201d New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert said in a state of the city address in May. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide spectrum that touches many different lived experiences \u2014 from mature adults on fixed incomes to young professionals just starting out.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** More Housing Supply, Even Luxury, Eases Rent Burdens\n\n**Key details:**\nRents are surging in cities with limited housing development, with the lowest-income ZIP codes seeing the highest increases, up to 10.3% from 2017 to 2024. A Pew analysis of Zillow data found a 10% increase in housing supply correlated with 1.4% slower rent growth. Cities that boosted housing supply saw the biggest rent declines in low-income areas. Even new luxury housing developments helped curb rent in older, less-expensive units by reducing competition.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis challenges the view that only directly subsidized affordable housing effectively addresses rent increases for low-income residents. The evidence suggests that increasing overall housing supply, including market-rate and luxury units, can significantly improve affordability. This happens by reducing competition for existing, lower-cost homes. Investors might see opportunity in markets actively expanding housing stock, regardless of specific housing type, for broader rent stabilization.\n\n**The big picture:**\nNearly half of U.S. renters are cost-burdened, spending over 30% of their income on rent. This issue is linked to a shortfall of up to 7.1 million rental homes for low-income renters who have \"nowhere to turn.\" Large metros with stifled housing development, like New York City, experience acute impacts, forcing displacement and contributing to record homelessness in 2024. Restrictive zoning exacerbates this housing shortage, burdening vulnerable tenants.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Rents in lowest-income ZIP codes increased as much as 10.3% from 2017 to 2024.\n*   A 10% increase in housing supply correlated with 1.4% slower rent growth.\n*   Shortfall of as many as 7.1 million rental homes for low-income renters.\n*   New York City increased housing stock only 4% from 2010-2023, despite a 22% job surge.\n*   Median rent in New Rochelle, New York, increased just 1.6% since 2020 after significant unit authorization.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Pew:** Conducted analysis correlating housing supply with slower rent growth and affordability.\n*   **Zillow:** Provided data from 2017\u20132023 for Pew's analysis on housing trends.\n*   **U.S. Census Bureau:** Reports nearly half of U.S. renters are currently considered cost-burdened.\n*   **New York City:** Example of a large metro with stifled housing development, causing displacement.\n*   **Austin, Texas:** City that significantly increased housing stock, experiencing rent declines for low-income renters.\n*   **New Rochelle, New York:** City that authorized 11,000+ new units, showing slow rent growth.\n*   **Wall Street Journal:** Reported on New Rochelle's successful housing supply and rent management.\n*   **Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert:** New Rochelle's mayor, commenting on affordable housing's diverse spectrum.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nIncreasing housing supply, even luxury units, eases rent burdens for all.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAfter nearly a decade in development limbo, the 235-unit Prescott Station apartment property is opening its doors in Oakland, California, with the help of modular design.\n\nOriginally entitled in 2012, Prescott Station was paused for nearly a decade before Alameda, California-based MBH Architects was brought on board in 2021 to reinitiate design and guide the project through construction as both modular and site architect, according to Timothy Haley, the project\u2019s director at MBH.\n\nThe six-story project, located on the former site of one of Oakland\u2019s largest encampments of people experiencing homelessness, made use of off-site construction to help provide its income-restricted housing, according to MBH. The building consists of a five-story modular structure over a podium, with units composed of one or two volumetric models, ranging from studios to two-bedroom apartments.\n\nThe architect had worked previously with the project\u2019s builder, Vallejo, California-based Harbinger Homes \u2014 formerly known as Factory_OS \u2014 on other projects throughout California. \u201cThat familiarity with both the technology and their internal processes gave [Oakland-based developer Holliday Development] confidence that we could navigate the project\u2019s restart,\u201d Haley said.\n\nHere, Haley talks with Multifamily Dive about the benefits and challenges of modular construction and plans for future projects.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMULTIFAMILY DIVE: How did you accommodate the site\u2019s design and compliance needs within the modular framework?\n\nTIMOTHY HALEY: Fitting multiple unit types into a consistent modular grid required early and deliberate design coordination. Our grid aligned closely with conventional framing standards, but we had to be surgical in how we approached plan layouts, window placements and adjacencies.\n\nTo meet the private open space requirements, we designed prefabricated balconies that were fabricated offsite and attached during installation. These \u201cplug-in\u201d components allowed us to remain within the modular delivery model while ensuring zoning compliance. It's a great example of how modular doesn\u2019t mean inflexible \u2014 it means planning ahead to enable performance on all fronts.\n\nWhat benefits did modular construction provide to the project?\n\nModular gave us several significant advantages \u2014 some predictable and some uniquely valuable given the project\u2019s urban location.\n\nOnce modules were on site, the pace of construction was dramatically accelerated. Controlled factory conditions ensured consistency in detailing, finishes and building envelope. Both hard and soft costs came down thanks to tighter scheduling and minimized weather-related delays.\n\nThe project saw a reduction in carbon footprint and construction waste, with factory efficiencies making a meaningful impact. Because modules were delivered with gypsum board already installed, we reduced the on-site fire load \u2014 a major benefit in dense urban areas. Less time \u201copen\u201d on site meant lower exposure to theft, vandalism or environmental damage.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges you faced in this development?\n\nThe biggest hurdle was coordination \u2014 educating and aligning site contractors and subcontractors unfamiliar with modular methods. Unlike conventional builds, modular construction demands tight sequencing and discipline across trades. You need a team that understands the interdependencies between the factory-built components and site-built systems.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about assembling boxes \u2014 it\u2019s about planning every connection, every tolerance, every delivery window.\n\nDo you anticipate doing further modular projects?\n\nAbsolutely. MBH has completed over 2,200 modular units to date, and we have more in the pipeline. That said, we view modular as one tool in a broader toolkit.\n\nIt\u2019s ideal for certain project types \u2014 especially mid-rise multifamily housing where time, cost and logistics are critical factors. But it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe bigger issue is the housing crisis. We believe the industry needs to approach it from every possible angle \u2014 modular, conventional \u2014 all depending on the site, the budget, and the timeline.\n\nModular is a powerful strategy, but it's not magic. The real advantage of modular comes when you integrate it into the project strategy from day one \u2014 aligning design, budget, logistics and schedule early to maximize efficiency.",

Tariffs are being passed along to customers on both current and future contracts.\n\nDemand remains strong for New Flyer, NFI\u2019s North American transit bus manufacturer, which reported a $13.5 billion backlog of orders, equaling more than 16,000 \"equivalent units.\" The company defines a 60-foot articulated transit bus as two buses and all others as a single unit.\n\nThe first half of this year saw increasing orders for internal combustion engine buses and a \u201cslight decline\u201d in the percentage of zero-emission buses on order, Soubry said, which \u201cwe think reflects the new U.S. administration's platform and customer procurement activity.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe cost of new transit buses soared 68% from 2021 to today, Soubry said, with the average selling price for heavy-duty transit buses up 2.7% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cWe were directly impacted by tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. and Canada\u201d during the second quarter, Soubry said. Moreover, the impact of tariffs is unpredictable, he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s changing every bloody day,\u201d Soubry said. \u201cA tariff yesterday was X on one country, and now it's Y,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can just imagine how fluid the thing is.\u201d\n\nHe said the company is working with its customers on existing orders to negotiate and amend contracts to reflect tariff costs. Last year, the Federal Transit Administration reminded agencies using federal funds to procure transit buses that they can ask the FTA for additional funds and can amend certain contracts to cover price increases.\n\nThe FTA said in a July 25 press release it will now allow transit agencies to change federally funded zero-emission projects to low-emissions technology, which could include vehicles or infrastructure. \u201cThat's the first time we've seen that,\u201d Soubry said.\n\nSoubry praised the FTA\u2019s funding announcements under the new administration. The U.S. Department of Transportation made $1.5 billion in grants available through the FTA\u2019s Buses and Bus Facilities and Low or No Emission bus grant programs in May and is keeping overall apportionments the same as last year.\n\n\u201cThis strong funding support should make for another positive year in the Low or No Emission Grant Program where NFI was the named partner on nearly $340 million awards in 2024,\u201d Soubry said.",

The current median rent for a three-bedroom home is $2,135, calculated based on rents in over 1,100 U.S. cities.\n\nAs of now, rent growth for single-family rental homes is trending below the historical 2%-4% range, below wage growth and inflation, according to the report. However, the market is coming off of several years of elevated rent growth in the post-pandemic period. Asking rents for single-family homes have risen 39.5% over the past five years, alongside only a 23% increase in the median household income nationwide, the report said.\n\nThis growth has placed increasing pressure on renters, according to the report, especially in coastal markets. In the most expensive cities, including San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts, renter households would require an annual income of $200,000 or higher to comfortably afford a three-bedroom single-family home \u2014 well over the median local income.\n\nRents rose most rapidly in the Midwest \u2014 up 6.1% across the entire region in the first half of the year \u2014 and the Northeast at 4.5%, followed by the Pacific at 3.1%, the Rocky Mountain region at 1.1% and the Southwest where rents remained flat.\n\nOut of the largest cities, Boston saw the highest annual rent growth at 12.5% YOY, up to $4,500 per month, followed by Staten Island, New York, at 9.4% YOY and Long Beach, California, at 9.0% YOY. The report attributes Boston\u2019s growth to its greater share of larger, higher-priced homes and a tight inventory.\n\nIn contrast, cities with the most affordable single-family rental homes include Toledo, Ohio, at $1,250 and Wichita, Kansas, at $1,350. Fort Wayne, Indiana, recorded the steepest year-over-year decline at -6.4%, followed by Dallas at -6.3%.\n\nDallas has had one of the most robust pipelines of new single-family rental home deliveries during the current construction boom.

Most of these new units are in the Southeast and Southwest, where rent growth has been slowest.\n\nApartment vacancies came in slightly higher in the first quarter at 8.2%. Overall, this trend creates a greater variety of choices for renters, as well as more bargaining power, which creates a downward pressure on rents in oversupplied or cooling markets, according to the report.\n\n\u201cDespite rising vacancy rates, expanded rental options and declining home prices in some parts of the country, these trends appear to signal a transitional phase rather than a cause for concern,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWhile home prices have fallen in select markets, high mortgage rates and softer consumer confidence continue to keep many renters from entering the housing market.

Forty-seven percent of respondents said modernization, including the adoption of AI, is their top priority, while 56% said reducing costs and 54% said improving security.\n\n\u201cState and local IT leaders recognize the imperative to modernize systems, but also need to lower costs and combat escalating cyber threats in the current environment,\u201d Chris Estes, technology leader and client service partner for the EY Center for Government Modernization, which conducted the survey, said in a statement.\n\nGenerative AI \u201coffers a once-in-a-generation opportunity\u201d for cities to modernize their systems, enabling them to \u201canticipate problems, tailor responses and target resources where they are needed most,\u201d Bloomberg Philanthropies said in a press release. \u201cWith the right coaching and capacity, data-savvy cities can seize the moment and deliver tangible results, building trust with citizens along the way.\u201d\n\nBloomberg cited a 2022 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report, which found that using manual processes costs U.S. government agencies an estimated $38.7 billion annually. The federal government alone spends approximately $143 billion every year on information collections, according to the report.\n\nThe City Data Alliance provides participants with technical assistance, access to innovation specialists and a network of fellow city leaders working toward similar modernization goals across North, Central and South America, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDenver Mayor Mike Johnston announced plans to use the program to expand progress the city has made in reducing street homelessness, which has declined 45% since 2023.\n\n\u201cThe key to sustained progress is reliable systems built to last and [to] keep our initiatives running long after we are gone, and this ambitious coalition of local leaders will help us tap into new technology to deliver the progress our residents deserve,\u201d Johnston said in a press release.\n\nBaltimore, Seattle and Tampa, Florida, are among the other U.S. cities participating in the alliance. Those cities have used the program to develop a database of people at high risk of gun violence, streamline housing applications and identify areas most impacted by hurricanes in real-time, respectively, according to Bloomberg.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Six New Cities Join Bloomberg AI Data Program for Government Modernization\n\n**Key details:**\nSix U.S. cities \u2014 Austin, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, and Newport News \u2014 are joining the Bloomberg Philanthropies City Data Alliance. This program, launched in 2022 with a $60 million investment, helps local governments use technological advancements like AI. It provides participants with technical assistance, innovation specialists, and a network of city leaders. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston plans to utilize the program to expand progress in reducing street homelessness.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAI use among state and local government agencies has roughly tripled since 2020, now reaching 45%, with 47% of IT leaders prioritizing modernization including AI. This indicates a significant acceleration in government tech adoption, challenging a potential consensus that public sector innovation is slow. Generative AI is presented as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" for cities to modernize systems, anticipate problems, and target resources, potentially addressing the $38.7 billion annual cost from manual government processes. The program aims to make government \"faster, smarter, and fair,\" delivering efficiently and making measurable progress.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe City Data Alliance, established in 2022, is designed for communities with populations of 100,000 or more. The program seeks to help governments improve efficiency and trust through data and technology. A 2022 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report highlighted that manual processes cost U.S. government agencies an estimated $38.7 billion annually. Other cities like Baltimore, Seattle, and Tampa are already participating, having used the program to develop databases for gun violence risk, streamline housing applications, and identify hurricane-impacted areas.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Six U.S. cities joining the alliance.\n*   Program launched in 2022 with a $60 million investment.\n*   AI use among state and local government agencies: roughly tripled since 2020, to 45%.\n*   47% of government IT leaders prioritize modernization including AI adoption.\n*   Manual processes cost U.S. government agencies an estimated $38.7 billion annually.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Bloomberg Philanthropies:** Launched and operates the City Data Alliance program for local government modernization.\n*   **James Anderson:** Government innovation program head at Bloomberg Philanthropies, commented on the program's goals.\n*   **EY:** Conducted a recent survey on AI use among state and local government IT leaders.\n*   **Chris Estes:** Technology leader and client service partner for the EY Center for Government Modernization, commented on IT leaders' priorities.\n*   **U.S. Chamber of Commerce:** Published a 2022 report on costs associated with manual processes in U.S. government agencies.\n*   **Denver Mayor Mike Johnston:** Announced plans to use the program to expand progress in reducing street homelessness.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAI adoption accelerates in local government, aiming for efficiency and cost savings.",

        "summary_text": "The South Platte River runs through the heart of Denver, but for much of the city\u2019s history, it has been ignored and abused. The river was the catalyst for the city\u2019s founding in 1858 after gold was discovered along its banks, but it was too shallow for navigation, pushing Denver to develop around the railroad station instead. In the 1940s and 1950s, I-25 cut a path through Denver, requiring substantial infrastructure along the river that constrained its natural floodplain, hampered its flow and turned it into a dumping ground for industrial waste and storm runoff.\n\nToday, city officials and a prominent developer are mining the river for a different kind of gold \u2014 real estate \u2014 with the River Mile project, 62 acres centered around a mile of reclaimed riverfront and \u201ca river made whole again,\u201d according to the project\u2019s website.\n\nKroenke Sports & Entertainment, which also owns the Denver Nuggets and the Colorado Avalanche, is partnering with The Downtown Denver Partnership and The Greenway Foundation to develop River Mile, one piece of a redevelopment that includes the 2014 renovation of Denver\u2019s Union Station and new entertainment districts around the city\u2019s sports stadiums.\n\nRiver Mile will include retail, high-rise residential buildings and entertainment venues built along narrow, walkable streets along a stretch of river that sits in the region\u2019s 100-year floodplain. This level of development, for years considered far too risky, is made possible because of an ambitious reworking of the South Platte, with new parks, restored wildlife habitats and enhanced wetlands that will filter stormwater. The river itself will be narrowed and deepened, and a whitewater recreation feature will naturally flush away sand.\n\nThe South Platte serves as the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of River Mile, said Ben Murphy, a civil engineer and project manager at Calibre Engineering and the lead engineer on the river restoration. Reclaiming the riverfront made the project more expensive than funneling the river through a concrete channel \u2014 standard operating procedure for urban flood control \u2014 would have been, he said. But the development team agreed that \u201cthe benefit you get from that \u2014 the uplift in the park space, the open space, the greenery \u2014 outweighs the cost.\u201d\n\nCalibre constructed wetlands along the riverbanks to slow and treat runoff from 36 stormwater outfalls that once dumped water from roads and sidewalks directly into the river, Murphy said. Bringing back native species along the banks will also make the entire area more resilient when flooding occurs, said Scott Shipley, Calibre\u2019s whitewater division manager.\n\nThat proved to be one of the trickier aspects of the project.\n\nYears ago, Denver removed all the coyote willows, fast-growing native shrubs that provide erosion control along the riverbanks, because debris was getting caught in their branches, creating a maintenance issue, Shipley said. \u201cBut if you actually think about it, that\u2019s their point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re stopping the trash from getting into the actual river.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Murphy added, city officials initially didn\u2019t want any trees at all along the riverbank because they could interfere with electrical transmission lines that run along the river. That was unacceptable for Murphy and Shipley. So, they found advocates within city government and Xcel Energy who helped convince city officials that \u201cthere are things to consider other than maintenance on infrastructure projects,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cThe initial reaction from the city staff on basically everything in the development was, what\u2019s the maintenance burden going to be on the development and the city?\u201d Murphy said. Changing that mindset was a matter of \u201cbringing in the right people to have the right discussions,\u201d Shipley said.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we said, \u2018Look, what\u2019s the priority here for you guys? Is it maintenance or is it river health?\u2019 And it was always river health,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMurphy and Shipley are well aware that River Mile is but one small fix in a larger problem. Barriers to river health are prevalent both upstream and downstream of the project. But they believe it\u2019s setting a standard for future restoration \u2014 and in fact, it has already helped similar projects secure government funding, Murphy said.\n\nDevelopments like River Mile aren\u2019t easy, Murphy added, but the team behind River Mile chose to \u201cdo the more complicated, harder thing because it\u2019s the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long run,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a much, much bigger boon to the city and the citizens of Denver.\u201d",

India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson labeled the targeting \"unjustified and unreasonable,\" asserting India will safeguard its national and economic security. This development directly challenges the prior consensus view that U.S. and India had been holding trade talks and floated the possibility of a deal, as the article explicitly states those discussions \"haven't yet resulted in a concrete agreement.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe new 25% tariff is an addition to a previous 25% duty on India announced last week, which was part of broader reciprocal levies affecting over 60 trading partners. President Donald Trump telegraphed this move in a CNBC interview, explicitly linking it to India's purchases of Russian oil. India maintains its oil imports from Russia are intended \"to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs\" for its consumers. While other U.S. trading partners, including the European Union and Japan, have reached trade deals, India has not.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Additional Tariff:** 25%\n*   **Total Tariff on India Imports:** 50%\n*   **General Effective Date:** August 27\n*   **Exception Effective Date:** September 17\n*   **U.S. Imports from India (2024):** ~$87 billion\n*   **India's Share of U.S. Trade (2024):** 2.4%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Issued an executive order imposing additional tariffs on Indian imports due to Russian oil purchases.\n*   **India's Ministry of External Affairs:** Spokesperson stated India's Russian oil imports ensure affordable energy and called the tariffs \"unjustified.\"\n*   **Secretary of Commerce:** Will determine if countries import Russian oil to recommend White House action.\n*   **CNBC's \"Squawk Box\":** Program where President Trump publicly foreshadowed the new tariff and its reasoning.\n*   **U.S. International Trade Commission:** Provided data detailing U.S. imports and exports with India.\n*   **European Union:** One of several U.S. trading partners that has reached a trade deal with the Trump administration.\n*   **Japan:** Another U.S. trading partner that has reached a trade deal framework with the Trump administration.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The additional 25% tariff on Indian imports is set to take effect on August 27.\n*   For products on their final mode of transit, the tariff will begin applying on September 17.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nU.S. tariffs on India escalate sharply, challenging trade stability over Russian oil.",

She added that the company aims to remain \u201cvery close to the competitive set,\u201d particularly on key items.\n\n\u201cWe worked hard and it shows in our price position as well that we've not passed through all of the inflation that we're seeing from a cost of goods perspective,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nHigher supply costs are also prompting Albertsons to review its own brand offerings, which accounted for nearly 26% penetration of brand sales in Q1, Morris said. The grocery chain believes the figure should be at least 30% as it sees growth opportunities for private label goods.\n\n\u201cSo, as we look forward and we look at the tariffs, it may be that there comes a point where we decide that an expansion in our assortment in [our] own brands is a great solution for our customer, and we're looking at that as well,\u201d Sharon McCollam, president and CFO, told analysts.\n\nMany imported ingredients used in food manufacturing are being hit by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff-heavy trade policy, pressuring prices for items such as cocoa.

While primarily sourcing domestically, the grocery chain would consider alternate suppliers if tariffs become \"unwieldy.\" Albertsons aims to pass higher costs to customers only when absolutely necessary, focusing on remaining competitive on key items. The company is also reviewing its private label offerings, seeking to increase their penetration from 26% to 30%.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nA brewing storm of climate change and tariffs has sent coffee prices soaring and accelerated interest in bean-free alternatives.\n\nDroughts in Vietnam and Brazil have decimated coffee crops, sending prices up to an all-time high earlier this year. Producers are now bracing for the prospect of even higher costs if new tariffs from the Trump administration go into effect next month on top coffee producing countries.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper and J.M. Smucker, which owns Folgers and Cafe Bustelo, have both raised prices as costs continue to escalate. Since last October, Smucker has raised coffee prices at least three times, with plans to hike them a fourth time this August, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nFor food tech companies and startups working on coffee alternatives, escalating prices could position bean-free substitutes as a cheaper, more sustainable option.\n\n\u201cThis can only happen now; 10, 20 years ago \u2026 there weren't those supply chain shocks,\u201d said Jake Berber, cofounder of Prefer, a Singapore-based startup that turns food waste into bean-free, ground coffee. \u201cToday, for the first time, we can create this product that is more affordable and more sustainable than coffee using modern, cutting edge fermentation technologies.\u201d\n\nPrefer, founded in 2022, makes its bean-free coffee from food byproducts, including soy pulp and broken rice. Berber said it uses ingredients that are \"not pretty enough to go in packaging,\" but contain the qualities and starches needed to create its coffee alternative through the company's fermentation process.\n\nLast February, Prefer raised $2 million in a seed round led by Forge Ventures to fund a manufacturing facility. The company's bean-free coffee is now available at several dozen outlets in Singapore, and is on track to reach 100 locations by the end of the year.\n\nStill, the bean-free alternative isn't a complete replacement and is meant to be used in addition to typical coffee. In order to achieve the same beloved flavor of a morning pour, only up to 40% of Prefer's substitute can be mixed in.\n\nBut those looking for a caffeine fix shouldn\u2019t worry. Prefer is able to make a wide range of caffeinated products, from decaffeinated to double caffeinated.\n\n\u201cCaffeine is just an ingredient for us to be easily sourced from things like green tea, for example,\u201d Berber said, adding that he plans to expand Prefer\u2019s products into other flavors threatened by climate change such as cacao, vanilla, and citrus.\n\nWith more than 2 billion cups consumed daily, coffee is already the world\u2019s most traded agricultural commodity and climate change is expected to push up prices in the long term. Half of the world's coffee farmland could be erased by 2050, and at least 60% of wild coffee species \u2014 including the beloved arabica \u2014 are at risk of going extinct in the wild due to deforestation and disease.\n\nWhile dwindling supply is spurring momentum for coffee alternatives, researchers in the industry say they believe the beloved beverage can be here to stay for a long time, with the right innovation and investment.\n\nWorld Coffee Research is working with coffee growers around the world to breed high quality varieties of coffee that are disease-resistant and productive \u2014 even in the face of often dire climate predictions. In 2024, the group secured a $10 million investment from its global member companies for agricultural R&D to enhance productivity, reduce environmental footprint, and sustain choice for consumers.\n\nHanna Neuschwander, senior advisor of communications at World Coffee Research, said researchers \u201care very optimistic that coffee that comes from a tree will continue to be a viable and important livelihood for many millions of people.\"\n\n\u201cYou have these alternatives arising to solve a problem, but there are many ways to solve a problem,\u201d she added.",

Smucker have already raised prices, with Smucker planning a fourth hike in August. This escalation positions bean-free alternatives as a potentially cheaper, more sustainable option.\n\n**Why it matters:** Soaring coffee prices are pressuring traditional producers, forcing multiple price increases onto consumers.

This occurred despite lowering performance targets and adding an extra scheduled delivery day. The OIG found USPS did not accurately anticipate package volume increases, forcing extra transportation purchases in some markets.

The measure passed days before European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland for trade negotiations.\n\nThose discussions led to a framework deal in which the U.S. agreed to lower planned tariffs on imports from the bloc from 30% to 15%. Under the pact, the bloc agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy exports and make a $600 billion investment in the country.\n\n\u201cThis deal provides a framework from which we will further reduce tariffs on more products, address non-tariff barriers and cooperate on economic security, because when the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible on both sides,\u201d von der Leyen said after the two leaders announced the agreement, adding that \u201cdetails have to be sorted out.\u201d\n\nDays later, Trump signed an executive order placing country-specific reciprocal duties on over 60 trading partners, including a 15% rate for imports from the EU, effective Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cThe EU continues to work with the US to finalise a Joint Statement, as agreed on 27 July,\u201d Gill said.\n\nThe EU has now delayed its countermeasures to U.S. tariffs three times, first announcing its intention in May to levy tariffs on 95 billion euros (roughly $107 billion at the time of announcement) of U.S. goods.\n\nThe bloc was also readying additional countermeasures covering 72 billion euros (roughly $84 billion) of U.S. imports, Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said on July 13.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJust days before President Trump signed his sweeping budget bill into law, the Senate removed a provision that would have \u201cdelinked\u201d drug list prices from compensation for drug middlemen. Now, a new analysis suggests that type of provision could have lowered annual U.S. drug spending by nearly $100 billion without hindering pharma innovation.\n\nDrug list prices grab a lot of attention and are often cited as an example of pharma excess. Orchard Therapeutics made headlines last year when it set the list price for its metachromatic leukodystrophy gene therapy, Lenmeldy, at $4.25 million.\n\nWhile Lenmeldy is a one-time treatment for an ultra-rare disease, list prices for the world\u2019s best-selling drugs are often scrutinized too. Merck & Co.\u2019s oncology powerhouse Keytruda sells for nearly$12,000 for a three-week dose, while the weight loss juggernaut Ozempic is priced at about $998 per injection pen. A recent Reuters survey of 45 drugs found that the median annual list price for a new drug was $370,000 in 2024.\n\nOf course, patients almost never pay a drug\u2019s full list price and can often receive rebates and other discounts if they\u2019re uninsured.\n\nList prices do matter to the country\u2019s overall drug spending, however, and pharmacy benefit managers are a prime example of why. PBMs are paid a percentage of a drug\u2019s list price, rather than a fixed administrative fee, for negotiating benefits on behalf of insurers and employers. In addition, evidence suggests they often steer patients toward drugs with more expensive list prices.\n\nIn 2023, PBMs, wholesalers and pharmacies received $215 billion of the U.S.\u2019s $650 billion prescription drug spending, according to analysis from the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and published in Health Affairs Scholar. The rest went to drugmakers.\n\nBut these intermediaries would have been paid just $119.6 billion if their compensation was based on revised payment models instead of list prices, according to the analysis, which breaks down how PBMs, wholesalers and pharmacies might have been paid using a fixed, transparent model. If PBMs received a fixed administrative fee of $4 per claim, instead of a percentage of the drug list price, for example, they would have received $27.6 billion in 2023.\n\nWhen combined with fees for wholesalers and pharmacies, the new approach would have triggered savings of $95.4 billion dollars \u2014 a 15% decrease \u2014 according to the analysis.\n\nPBM reform is a hot topic, and as of late 2024 all 50 states had passed legislation with some sort of provisions to rein in PBM profits. The most common approaches prohibit gag clauses that would prevent pharmacies from telling patients about lower-cost options; limit patient cost sharing; and require PBM licensure or registration. Other measures include rebate reporting requirements and ending payment discrimination against non-PBM-affiliated pharmacies.\n\nBut none of these measures are enough to bring meaningful change, argues the analysis\u2019s author, Geoffrey Joyce.\n\n\u201cDelinking compensation from list prices is the clearest and most effective way to tackle the warped incentives in the prescription drug supply chain that drive up costs for patients without adversely affecting manufacturers\u2019 incentive to innovate,\u201d Joyce said in a statement.\n\nThere is still movement toward delinking on the federal level. A few days after the PBM provision was removed from the new spending and tax bill, 12 bipartisan members of Congress led by Rep. Earl L. \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter (R-GA) introduced the PBM Reform Act, which would delink PBM compensation from the cost of medications under Medicare Part D.\n\nThe legislation also introduces other approaches to lower drug spending such as a ban on \u201cspread pricing\u201d in Medicaid, a requirement to promote transparency for employers and patients in prescription drug plans, a new effort to enforce oversight on reported violations and more.",

A new analysis suggests this type of provision could have lowered annual U.S. drug spending by nearly $100 billion. The analysis indicates these savings would occur without hindering pharmaceutical innovation. It further details how pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), wholesalers, and pharmacies received a significant portion of drug spending in 2023. The proposed revised payment models, such as fixed administrative fees for PBMs, are central to achieving these reductions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis analysis directly challenges the established financial model of pharmacy benefit managers and other drug intermediaries. The current system, where PBMs are compensated based on a percentage of a drug\u2019s list price, is presented as creating distorted incentives that drive up costs. The potential for a nearly $100 billion annual reduction in drug spending, as suggested by the analysis, signifies a profound flaw in the prevailing compensation structure. This information could prompt investors to reassess the long-term profitability and operational stability of companies heavily embedded in the existing drug supply chain.\n\n**The big picture:**\nDrug list prices, such as Orchard Therapeutics' Lenmeldy at $4.25 million or Merck & Co.'s Keytruda at nearly $12,000 for a three-week dose, frequently draw scrutiny. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are integral to the U.S. drug supply chain, negotiating benefits for insurers and employers. Their compensation model, tied to a percentage of the drug's list price rather than a fixed fee, is a key point of contention. While all 50 states have passed some PBM reform legislation, the analysis's author, Geoffrey Joyce, argues these measures are not sufficient for meaningful change.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Nearly $100 billion: Potential annual U.S. drug spending reduction by delinking compensation.\n*   $650 billion: Total U.S. prescription drug spending in 2023.\n*   $215 billion: Amount PBMs, wholesalers, and pharmacies received from drug spending in 2023.\n*   $95.4 billion: Estimated savings from proposed new payment models, representing a 15% decrease.\n*   $4: Proposed fixed administrative fee per claim for PBMs in the revised model.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Trump:** Signed a sweeping budget bill from which a drug delinking provision was removed.\n*   **Orchard Therapeutics:** Made headlines for setting its gene therapy Lenmeldy's list price at $4.25 million.\n*   **Lenmeldy:** Gene therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy with a list price of $4.25 million.\n*   **Merck & Co.:** Drugmaker whose oncology drug Keytruda sells for nearly $12,000 per dose.\n*   **Keytruda:** Merck & Co.'s oncology drug, priced at nearly $12,000 for a three-week dose.\n*   **Ozempic:** Weight loss drug priced at approximately $998 per injection pen.\n*   **USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics:** Conducted the analysis suggesting large drug spending reductions.\n*   **Health Affairs Scholar:** Journal that published the new analysis on drug spending.\n*   **Geoffrey Joyce:** Author of the analysis, arguing existing PBM reforms are insufficient for meaningful change.\n*   **Rep.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nDavid Altshuler, the renowned geneticist who\u2019s helped shape Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 research strategy over the last decade, will step down next year, the company said Monday.\n\nAlongside its quarterly earnings report, Vertex said Altshuler, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, will retire on Aug. 1, 2026 as part of a \u201cplanned transition.\u201d Mark Bunnage, Vertex\u2019s senior vice president of global research, will assume Altshuler\u2019s role on Feb. 1. He\u2019s worked alongside Altshuler since 2016 and has run discovery research at Vertex since March 2024, the company said.\n\nAltshuler was named to Vertex\u2019s board of directors in 2012 and officially hired to lead its internal and external research efforts three years later. Since then, the company has branched out from its core cystic fibrosis business and brought to market the first CRISPR gene editing therapy as well as a new kind of pain medicine. \u201cI would like to express my deep gratitude to David for his exceptional scientific vision and patient impact,\u201d CEO Reshma Kewalrami said in a statement.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhen Altshuler joined Vertex in 2015, he stepped into a company still scarred by a near-catastrophic setback.\n\nWhile Vertex had a pair of fast-selling cystic fibrosis drugs at the time, it was only a few years removed from the collapse of a once-budding hepatitis C business. Company executives attributed the business\u2019 fall to underestimating the competition and not diversifying quickly enough. They vowed to plan better in the future.\n\nAltshuler was tasked with leading that plan. A founding member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and leader of several important genetic research studies, Altshuler sought to work on conditions caused by easily identifiable genetic mutations. The idea was to do so within certain \u201cspecialty diseases\u201d \u2014 typically rare disorders for which medicines can be sold at high prices and with a small sales force. Vertex would iteratively test several similar drugs for these conditions, hoping to find medicines that stand out and then improve upon them.\n\n\u201cDisproportionate value is created when you actually open a disease,\u201d Altshuler said in an interview in 2021, contrasting the company\u2019s approach with the more typical strategy of pursuing many programs within a broad therapeutic area.\n\nVertex\u2019s strategy drew skepticism from Wall Street investors over the years. But it cemented a cystic fibrosis business that\u2019s produced five drugs and withstood multiple challenges. It also saw Vertex branch out into other areas. A partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics yielded the gene-editing blood disease drug Casgevy, which was approved by regulators in 2023. Long-running pain research led to the clearance of Journavx, an alternative to opioids, in January. Vertex\u2019s market value has more tripled since Altshuler came aboard.\n\nYet it\u2019s still not clear whether Vertex has found a second drug franchise. Casgevy\u2019s launch is going slow, and Vertex\u2019s pain medications may not become the multibillion-dollar business it envisioned. The company has shelved multiple attempts at drugs for the rare disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, as well as one of two diabetes cell therapy programs in clinical development. A yearslong collaboration with Moderna hasn\u2019t yet borne fruit.\n\nVertex is progressing two programs for two types of kidney conditions through late-stage testing, one of which was acquired in a nearly $5 billion deal last year. Another diabetes cell therapy could be submitted to regulators in 2026, and earlier research in a type of muscular dystrophy as well as a different kidney disease are ongoing.\n\nStill, \u201cone of the main questions for the stock is \u2018what\u2019s the next [cystic fibrosis]?\u201d and it\u2019s unclear whether the company\u2019s current pipeline is aimed at \u201cmarket opportunities that are meaningful enough to be narrative changing,\u201d Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a Monday note to clients.",

Bunnage has worked alongside Altshuler since 2016 and led discovery research at Vertex since March 2024. This leadership change was announced alongside the company's quarterly earnings report.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAltshuler has shaped Vertex's research strategy for the last decade, leading to market entries like the first CRISPR gene editing therapy. Vertex's market value more than tripled since his arrival. However, Vertex\u2019s strategy previously drew skepticism from Wall Street investors. His departure raises questions about finding a second drug franchise, with an analyst stating it's unclear if the current pipeline targets \"narrative changing\" market opportunities.\n\n**The big picture:**\nWhen Altshuler joined in 2015, Vertex was \"scarred\" by the collapse of its hepatitis C business, attributed by executives to underestimating competition and insufficient diversification. Altshuler was tasked with leading a new plan, focusing on \"specialty diseases\" caused by identifiable genetic mutations. This strategy strengthened the cystic fibrosis business, yielding five drugs, and expanded into areas like gene-editing and pain medicine.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   David Altshuler will step down on Aug. 1, 2026.\n*   Mark Bunnage will assume the Chief Scientific Officer role on Feb. 1.\n*   Vertex\u2019s market value has more than tripled since Altshuler joined in 2015.\n*   Casgevy, a gene-editing drug, was approved by regulators in 2023.\n*   Vertex acquired a kidney program in a nearly $5 billion deal last year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **David Altshuler:** Vertex's chief scientific officer for a decade, departing in 2026 after shaping research strategy.\n*   **Vertex Pharmaceuticals:** Biopharmaceutical company facing a leadership transition with CSO Altshuler's planned retirement.\n*   **Mark Bunnage:** Vertex's senior vice president of global research, appointed to succeed Altshuler as CSO.\n*   **Reshma Kewalrami:** Vertex CEO, expressed deep gratitude for Altshuler's exceptional scientific vision and patient impact.\n*   **CRISPR Therapeutics:** Partnered with Vertex to develop Casgevy, the approved gene-editing blood disease drug.\n*   **Paul Matteis:** Stifel analyst, questioned Vertex's pipeline's potential for \"narrative changing\" market opportunities.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Mark Bunnage will assume the role of Chief Scientific Officer on Feb. 1.\n*   Another diabetes cell therapy could be submitted to regulators in 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAltshuler's departure shifts focus to Vertex's pipeline and next growth drivers.",

And despite a yearslong slowdown, Big Pharma is always seeking business development opportunities to keep the wheels turning.\n\nWith external factors like looming tariffs and restrictive pricing policies on the horizon, plus a swarm of patent expirations in sight, company leaders are bolstering their pipelines in search of new drugs and a competitive advantage.\n\nIn the reporting earnings for the first half of the year, executives at the world\u2019s biggest pharma companies are shedding light on their dealmaking strategies moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot to do on business development.

But CEO Rob Davis said analysts consistently underappreciate the company\u2019s pipeline, pointing to more recent launches like Winrevair and Capvaxive that have outperformed expectations.\n\nDavis also made it clear that Merck is still in the market for more M&A beyond this year\u2019s $10 billion purchase of Verona Pharma, which brought in the COPD drug Ohtuvayre. Davis called the acquisition a multibillion-dollar opportunity and signaled that he\u2019s looking for more.\n\n\u201cWe want to minimize the cliff, which I think we have done,\u201d Davis said on the call. \u201cWe want to get back to growth quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout any significant [losses of exclusivity] this decade, we have the flexibility to invest more \u2026 to continue to acquire external innovation.

But the pharma giant proved it was prepared not only with two newer blockbusters in the same immunology arena \u2014 Skyrizi and Rinvoq \u2014 but enough cash to pursue other opportunities, as well.\n\nCEO Rob Michael said on an earnings call that the company is peering well into the future, investing in early-stage programs to \u201cdrive growth for the company in the next decade and beyond.\u201d AbbVie is rumored to be eyeing the purchase of psychedelic mental health drugmaker Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals for about $1 billion, which would mark a step into a relatively new area for Big Pharma.\n\nBeyond straight-up M&A, AbbVie has also delved into collaborations, including one with ADARx Pharmaceuticals to develop siRNA therapeutics in several of the pharma giant\u2019s core areas: neuroscience, immunology and oncology.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with BioNTech has the potential to enhance our growth profile in the back end of the decade into the 2030s while strengthening and diversifying our oncology portfolio.\u201d Adam Lenkowski CCO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb has also taken to the dealmaking table via a partnership with pandemic-era darling BioNTech. The pharma giant learned from its oncology blockbuster Opdivo how to manage a bestselling cancer drug, and chief commercialization officer Adam Lenkowski believes the collaborative effort on the cancer vaccine BNT-321 \u201chas the potential to become a new standard of care for many patients and could transform the current landscape as a backbone of cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nCEO Chris Boerner said that the company\u2019s cash position sets it up to make business development a priority.\n\n\u201cIf we have to do it, we have a lot of flexibility to do it. To us, it\u2019s not our lifeline like it is for so many companies.\u201d Leonard Schleifer CEO, Regeneron\n\nRegeneron is the type of pharma that likes to forge its own path rather than invest in external innovation. And although CEO Leonard Schleifer has opened the purse strings from time to time, he often keeps his cards close to the vest.\n\nBut with key patents for the blockbuster retinal disease treatment Eylea expiring in the next few years, the company might feel pressure to play the dealmaking game a little more. On the earnings call, Schleifer said Regeneron \u201cspends a lot of time looking at a lot of things.\u201d\n\nTo Schleifer, traditional pharma M&A amounts to \u201cpulling on threads\u201d and betting on programs that might not pay off in the long run, whereas internal efforts at Regeneron are more reliable.\n\n\u201cWe have such a productive platform in mRNA that we have an abundance of assets.\" St\u00e9phane Bancel CEO, Moderna\n\nModerna is another company that would rather keep its eyes on its own paper. With a groundbreaking mRNA platform in tow, CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said Moderna is more likely to form partnerships with companies like Merck than seek outside innovation.\n\nInstead of M&A, Moderna has expanded its pipeline with dozens of candidates in infectious disease and cancer. But with losses mounting on its COVID-19 vaccine, the biotech is nearing crunch time for investors. Just before the earnings call, Moderna announced layoffs amounting to 10% of its workforce.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Trump administration unveiled a string of new healthcare policies last week, introducing a pilot program that introduces a major shift in favor of the pharma industry.\n\nAfter recently being blocked from implementing their own rebate models for the controversial 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides discounted medications to healthcare centers that serve low-income or uninsured patients, drugmakers will soon have the opportunity to voluntarily participate in a pilot that changes this dynamic. The pilot allows drugmakers to replace the current upfront discounts on certain 340B drugs with rebates instead, the Health Resources & Services Administration, a part of HHS, announced.\n\nSeveral Big Pharma companies, as well as the industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group PhRMA, have pushed for a rebate model to replace 340B\u2019s discount structure, which critics argue has been abused by some hospitals.\n\nDrugmakers and PhRMA maintain that a rebate system would improve oversight, reduce duplicate discounts and modernize the program.\n\nOn the flip side, healthcare industry groups have said a rebate model will harm hospitals by forcing them to cover higher drug prices while they wait to recoup some of their costs.\n\nHHS has so far not allowed drugmakers to implement their own rebate models, even after drugmakers sued the agency last year. Under its own model, HHS is implementing guardrails by limiting the pilot to just the 10 drugs that were selected for the CMS Medicare drug price negotiation program for 2026. The model will help HRSA understand \u201cthe merits and shortcomings of the rebate model,\u201d the administration said. And the limited run could expand in the future.\n\nRebates vs. discounts\n\nSince the 340B program was established in the 1990s, it has grown to include nearly 60% of all hospitals. This expansion has increasingly caught the attention of the pharma industry, which has voiced concerns about abuse in the program and blamed HRSA for not keeping up the pace of oversight.\n\nIn particular, drugmakers are worried about duplicate discounts, where a hospital allegedly purchases a drug at the discounted rate but also receives a Medicaid rebate. Rebates instead of discounts, they argue, would erase the problem.\n\n\u201cUnder a rebate model, a covered entity would pay for the drug at a higher price upfront and then later receive a post-purchase rebate that reflects the difference between the higher initial price and the 340B price,\u201d the announcement on the federal register reads.\n\nThat higher upfront cost could translate to millions of dollars that hospitals are forced to temporarily cover. The average annual \u201cfloat\u201d by hospitals to pharma companies is estimated to be more than $72 million, according to 340B Health, a nonprofit organization representing 340B hospitals and health systems. The financial impact of waiting for rebates could cripple operations for some providers \u2014 27% of hospitals said waiting a month for rebates could hinder payroll and force layoffs, 340B Health found.\n\nNot only will hospitals have to cover more costs \u2014 they\u2019ll face new administrative burdens with a rebate model.\n\n\u201cThe pilot model's impact on hospitals and health systems introduces several operational, financial and strategic risks,\u201d said Joel Wright, president, pharmacy services at VytlOne, a pharmacy solutions provider. \u201cManaging rebate claims and reconciling payments adds complexity and risk of denied rebates due to technicalities or eligibility disputes.\u201d\n\nNotably, the pilot requires all rebates to be paid within 10 calendar days of submissions, and hospitals will have 45 days from the date of dispensation to submit and report data for rebates.\n\nAnd because the pilot covers just 10 drugs in the Medicare drug price negotiation program, rebate lobbyists say it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s rebate pilot is a positive first step toward addressing hospital abuse of the 340B program, but we believe it should cover all medicines and address broader program integrity concerns,\u201d Alex Shriver, senior vice president at PhRMA, told PharmaVoice in an email.\n\n340B Health disagrees and is concerned about the program expanding further.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize the agency\u2019s intent to test a limited rebate model tied to IRA implementation, we remain deeply concerned about the financial and administrative burdens the rebate approach will place on 340B hospitals,\u201d said Maureen Teston, president and CEO of 340B Health. \u201cHRSA says it could choose to expand the list of drugs after next year following its evaluation of the pilot program.\u201d\n\nWith HRSA\u2019s announcement, eligible drug manufacturers can apply to participate in the voluntary pilot until Sept. 15, with approvals coming by Oct. 15 and going into effect on Jan. 1, 2026. The Office of Pharmacy Affairs will review and accept pilot applications from drugmakers involved in the Medicare drug price negotiation program for 2026.\n\nA public comment period of 30 days is also open on the federal register.\n\nPharma\u2019s legal fight\n\nA handful of drugmakers attempted to launch their own rebate models last year, which HRSA blocked. Eli Lilly, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Novartis, Sanofi, Kalderos and Johnson & Johnson sued HHS in an effort to push through their rebate models, but district judges upheld the agency\u2019s authority, declaring that HHS has the authority to approve or deny rebate models before they can be effective.\n\nHRSA had several concerns with drugmakers\u2019 rebate models, according to Wright, including a lack of approval, the potential to undermine the program\u2019s safeguards, obscure pricing and eligibility data, as well as complicated enforcement.\n\nWhile the judges stood with HHS, they did not say such models were prohibited, only that HRSA had to approve them first. The pilot doesn\u2019t suggest outright that drugmakers will be able to implement their own rebate models in the future, but it does give the agency a chance to test a change to the discount structure.\n\n\u201cLimiting the pilot to IRA negotiated drugs represents a strategic trade-off \u2014 narrowing the scope from pharmaceutical manufacturers' initial 340B rebate model while enabling the industry to evaluate the model\u2019s effectiveness,\u201d Wright said via email.",

And although many of the complexities surrounding Alzheimer\u2019s persist, Merck is doubling down on recent advances to more effectively target the core pathologies of the disease.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field,\u201d said Dr. Mike Egan, vice president of neuroscience global clinical development at Merck. \u201cWhat drugs are we going after, and what is the appropriate disease stage in terms of selecting drug targets?

A renewed emphasis on neuroscience appears to be part of that forward-looking strategy.\n\nThese two candidates will carry what Merck neuroscience leaders hope is a resurgence in the pharma\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s prowess into a new era, catching up to rivals and bringing effective treatments to the challenging arena.\n\nLearning from history\n\nThe current roster of Alzheimer\u2019s drug hopefuls isn\u2019t Merck\u2019s first stroll around the block. Along with many drugmakers still targeting the memory-stealing disease, the company walks a path littered with failures.\n\nBack before the first anti-amyloid approvals of the early 2020s, Merck and fellow pharma giants were all aiming at a different target altogether: the BACE inhibitor. One by one, though, as Merck ended its BACE inhibitor program in 2018 due to poor efficacy, so did the other drugmakers, including bigwigs like Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Novartis and Eisai.\n\nThis time around, Merck\u2019s understanding of the disease\u2019s targets has improved to the point that the company is better prepared to bring the drugs through trials, said Jonathan Sugam, principal scientist of neuroscience discovery at Merck.\n\n\u201cAdvances in the field over the past decade or so have taken us toward what we think are the most appropriate targets based on both genetically validated targets in the appropriate disease population, as well as targets we think are most viable based on what we\u2019ve learned about the biomarkers that describe the pathophysiology of the disease, tau being one of the big ones,\u201d Sugam said.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field.\" Dr. Mike Egan VP, neuroscience, global clinical development, Merck & Co.\n\nAlong with many of the companies licking their BACE inhibitor wounds from almost 10 years ago, Merck learned some important lessons about the approach to Alzheimer\u2019s. From trial design to viable endpoints to the balance of speed and precision, Egan said that \u201cit\u2019s important to continue to invest in Alzheimer\u2019s disease to get clear, strong biomarker evidence of target engagement and disease biology before going to big phase 3 trials.\u201d\n\nThat perspective is critical as the company moves ahead with these two candidates, and Sugam said Merck is better prepared this time. Alzheimer\u2019s trials are notoriously difficult to recruit and enroll because of the complexity of the disease, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better equipped now than we were previously to identify the right patient at the right time for the right therapy,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cUsing biomarkers to identify and track patients appropriately in a trial \u2026 is one of the biggest innovations in the field.\u201d\n\nTau and PAM\n\nMK-2214 is designed to clear tau tangles in the brain, which, along with amyloid plaques, are considered one of the hallmarks of the disease. But unlike some other drugs that clear tau, the antibody takes aim not just at the protein itself but also its mechanism of spreading to different regions of the brain, making it a potential prevention in pre-symptomatic patients.\n\nThat process begins with the specific target pS413, which is a type of extracellular tau associated with accumulation of the protein in the brain. By tracking these tau \u201cseeds\u201d as they spread, Merck researchers have found that an antibody can more effectively root out drivers of the disease than a more general tau inhibitor.\n\n\u201cWe can actually see the progression of this tau over time in different brain regions and stage the disease appropriately,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cWe believe, along with others, that this pathological spreading of tau is a key driver of some of the disease process and some of the symptomology of the disease \u2014 being able to target that with an antibody like MK-2214 is something we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\n\nAnd by targeting the \u201cseeds\u201d of corruption in the brain, MK-2214 could potentially be used earlier in patients who show tau accumulation without the telltale symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s such as cognitive decline, Egan said. That also determines the window in which patients will be included in clinical trials.\n\n\u201cA key question is, when does the seeding occur? It probably occurs early,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe have to take a Goldilocks approach, similar to how Lilly conducted [Kisunla] trials in people with moderate amounts of tau, as opposed to too much or not enough \u2014 people who haven\u2019t had tau seeded to all their cortical neurons.\u201d\n\nOn top of MK-2214, Merck is also in mid-stage trials for a drug candidate that takes a wholly different approach. MK-1167 is an alpha-7 positive allosteric modulator, known as PAM, that targets and turns on a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. By bringing acetylcholine back online, MK-1167 could improve cognitive function in patients already experiencing symptoms.\n\nLeaning into the company\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s resurgence, Egan said there\u2019s room for more molecules in the pipeline \u2014 and Merck is willing to open the purse strings for the right prospect, employing M&A or partnerships to bolster the portfolio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to say to the world that if you have good Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, feel free to touch base with us, because we have both an internal pipeline and an external pipeline \u2014 nobody has a monopoly on good ideas,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe want to pursue new medications that could help patients, whether it\u2019s for disease modification or cognition or symptomatic approaches.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIf Novo Nordisk aimed to boost confidence in the company\u2019s future course by naming a new CEO, those hopes were dashed this week.\n\nThe weight loss and diabetes juggernaut announced that Maziar Mike Doustdar \u2014 a long-time company executive \u2014 is taking the reins on Tuesday, calling him the \u201cbest person\u201d to lead Novo into its \u201cnext growth phase.\u201d\n\nNovo shares plunged over 20% after the news came out \u2014 its largest single-day drop ever recorded.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s much more to Novo\u2019s story than the CEO news, which comes as the industry grapples with a range of market challenges, including widespread regulatory changes, potential tariffs, patent cliffs and more. In fact, Novo is one of several large pharmas to shake up their top brass this month.\n\nHere\u2019s more on Novo\u2019s major leadership transition and other companies attempting to right the ship with a fresh face behind the wheel.\n\nNovo\u2019s descent back to earth\n\nAfter its weight-loss-fueled ascent to the sales stratosphere, Novo is working to try to keep its growth sky high.\n\nIn May, the Danish pharma said CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen would step down, following a turn in the obesity market. While Novo was the star of the emerging weight loss and diabetes market through its GLP-1s Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly took over the majority of the market officially earlier this year thanks to growing popularity for Zepbound and Wegovy. The switchup brought Novo back to the drawing board for a rebound.\n\nThis week, while naming its new CEO, the company also cut its guidance for 2025 from a sales increase of 13% to 21% to between 8% and 14% after slower-than-expected uptake of its GLP-1 products. Doustdar is now tasked with the challenge of navigating Novo\u2019s new era as the second-place obesity leader, grappling with slower growth, potential incoming competitors and compounded versions of its drugs still available on the cheap for some patients.\n\nDoustdar has been with Novo for more than 30 years, most recently serving as executive vice president of international operations after getting his start as an office clerk in Vienna during the 1990s. He oversaw the launch of Novo\u2019s GLP-1s in several countries, and could tighten up the ship with workforce cuts once at the helm in August, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI come to this role with a sense of urgency, a laser focus on high performance, and a fierce determination for Novo Nordisk to aim higher than it\u2019s ever done,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAmid the changes at the top, Novo also restructured its R&D, combining two divisions into one, which will be led by the company\u2019s newly appointed chief scientist, Dr. Martin Holst Lange.\n\nKenvue\u2019s shaky future\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s decision to spin off its consumer health business in 2023 followed a wave of similar moves by major pharma companies such as Sanofi and GSK. The goal was to streamline, simplify and refocus on the business of innovating drugs.\n\nBut since going it alone, J&J\u2019s spinoff Kenvue has struggled to find its footing as a mammoth, multi-faceted company with a broad OTC drug portfolio including stalwarts such as Tylenol and Benadryl, along with household favorite brands like Aveeno and Listerine.\n\nSeveral headwinds \u2014 including falling sales at retail pharmacies \u2014 have triggered pressure from activist investors to make a change. Starboard Value already has a seat on the company\u2019s board, and earlier this year Third Point and Toms Capital bought up more of its stock.\n\nWith Kenvue in the midst of a strategic review, CEO Thibaut Mongon was ousted suddenly this month and replaced by interim head Kirk Perry, the company\u2019s board director. While the company touted Perry\u2019s 30 years of leadership in consumer packaged goods, it said an executive search firm has been hired to lead the quest for its next permanent CEO.\n\nIn its preliminary earnings report for the most recent quarter, Kenvue said it expects a 4% sales drop.\n\nNews of the shift has fueled investor speculation that Kenvue is preparing to sell some of its brands or setting the stage for an outright acquisition of the company, which is currently valued at $40 billion.\n\nJazz sings new tune with CEO switch\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals made history by scoring the first FDA approval for a CBD-based drug in 2018. Now, Epidiolex, which is indicated for two rare forms of epilepsy, is on its way to crossing the blockbuster threshold this year, providing an ample revenue cushion for the company\u2019s ongoing pursuit of M&A.\n\nBut Jazz\u2019s next big act could be in oncology. The Ireland-based biopharma picked up Chimerix this year for $935 million to nab a brain tumor candidate, potentially building on a portfolio that also includes a HER2-targeting bispecific antibody that\u2019s already won an accelerated approval in one cancer indication and is being studied in several more. Citeline has pegged the treatment, Ziihera, as a potential blockbuster.\n\nWith its future coming into sharper focus, Jazz announced new leadership plans this month. Ren\u00e9e Gal\u00e1 will step into the CEO role in August as former CEO Bruce Cozadd retires. Gal\u00e1, who became the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer in 2023 and brings over 30 years of industry experience to the post, has played a \u201ccritical role in driving Jazz\u2019s ongoing transformation.\u201d",

At the time, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary called his hiring a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d for CBER, as Prasad brought the \u201cscientific rigor, independence and transparency\u201d the office needed, he claimed.\n\nMakary later named Prasad as the FDA\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer, in addition to his role at CBER.\n\nPrasad was a vocal opponent of his predecessor Dr. Peter Marks, who ran CBER for nearly a decade before resigning in March after a dispute with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Marks championed regulatory flexibility while at the FDA and, as head of CBER, oversaw the review and approvals of COVID-19 vaccines as well as dozens of cell and gene therapies. Prasad previously criticized many of those decisions and, notably, had castigated Marks for overruling FDA reviewers in clearing Sarepta Therapeutics\u2019 Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy Elevidys.\n\nPrasad\u2019s appointment had raised questions among many biotech companies and investors that FDA standards might be shifting. After joining the FDA, Prasad quickly worked with Makary to establish stricter approval guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines. He also three times stepped in to overrule other agency reviewers in issuing narrower-than-requested clearances for COVID shots developed by Moderna and Novavax.\n\nAt a round table meeting hosted by the FDA in early June, Prasad attempted to ease concerns CBER might be less flexible under his watch in regulating gene therapies for rare conditions.\n\n\u201cWe understand that progress is not always made in a single leap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will consider incremental steps forward, because those add up.\u201d\n\nA month later, the FDA rejected a Duchenne cell therapy from Capricor Therapeutics that Prasad reportedly scrutinized. Shortly afterwards, the FDA engaged in an unusual public standoff with Sarepta over its Duchenne gene therapy Elevidys. Following the deaths of two Elevidys recipients \u2014 as well as the death of a study volunteer who received a different gene therapy \u2014 the agency asked Sarepta to halt all shipments of its treatment. After initially defying the request, Sarepta agreed, and published reports suggested the company might need new safety data before the FDA would allow Elevidys back on the market.\n\nBut in the ensuing days, Prasad was targeted by right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, other conservative commentators and in op-eds published in The Wall Street Journal. One Journal op-ed criticized him as being a \u201cBernie Sanders acolyte in MAHA drag\u201d and a \u201cone-man death panel.\u201d Another argued his decisionmaking suggested he believes \u201cpeople can\u2019t be trusted to make their own decisions about risks and benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen the FDA suddenly allowed Sarepta to resume some shipments of Elevidys on Monday, some Wall Street analysts speculated higher-ups within the Trump administration had stepped in.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a resignation in the short term,\u201d Baird analyst Brian Skorney wrote in a note to investors on Monday.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRoche\u2019s efforts to break into the lucrative obesity market haven\u2019t abated. The pharma giant sealed the largest deal in the space earlier this year when it announced a collaboration with Zealand Pharma for more than $5 billion. The agreement built on Roche\u2019s $2.7 billion deal to pick up Carmot Therapeutics and its suite of early- and mid-stage obesity candidates in 2023.\n\nAfter shelling out to get into the race, the Swiss pharma\u2019s strategy to enter the market with differentiated assets is becoming clearer as the drugs move through the clinic.\n\nNow, the Swiss pharma is revealing more about its long-term pipeline plans and potential move to join the ranks of other Big Pharma companies in the direct-to-patient space.\n\nObesity pipeline\n\nRoche\u2019s lead obesity candidate, CT-388, is a weekly injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Currently in phase 2, the drug has already shown promising weight loss results. In a phase 1b trial, patients lost an average of 18.8% over 24 weeks.\n\nThe company plans to announce a phase 3 study in obesity for the drug later this year, according to its most recent earnings presentation. In addition, Roche wants to study CT-388 combined with petrelintide, a mid-stage amylin analog it licensed in its deal with Zealand.\n\n\u201cBoth petrelintide and CT-388 are currently in phase 2 studies, and we will need to review the results of those two monotherapy studies before we can share very specific timelines and details for the phase 2 combination,\u201d said Teresa Graham, Roche\u2019s CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the company\u2019s innovative medicines arm, on an earnings call. \u201cHowever, our expectation is that we will be moving into combo initiation in 2026.\u201d\n\nThe combo therapy plan was part of the original deal with Zealand. The company was previously studying a combination of an early-stage asset CT-173 with CT-388. But Roche revealed that it\u2019s cutting CT-173 from its pipeline in the earnings report.\n\nThe candidate, a long-acting peptide YY analog that had not yet entered human trials, was picked up in the Carmot acquisition. The drug aimed to control appetite by targeting the PYY hormone, and Roche had originally planned to enter phase 1 testing this year before axing it.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to discontinue CT-173 \u2026 based on a comprehensive assessment of its developability, competitive positioning and commercial viability,\u201d Graham said.\n\nRoche is also exploring an oral GLP-1 that could give the company a competitive edge if it enters the obesity market down the line. With one early-stage asset off the books, Roche still has several options in the works.\n\n\"Overall with our obesity portfolio \u2026 we still feel very confident that we have a potentially best in disease and highly competitive portfolio of products,\u201d Graham said on a separate call with media last week.\n\nA DTC play?\n\nRoche may also take a page from Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which all launched DTC platforms for certain medications, including obesity and diabetes drugs.\n\nWhile other pharmas have also created DTC channels, Lilly and Novo\u2019s offerings launched amid an exploding market with insurance coverage challenges. Via the DTC platforms, the meds are available for about half the price in a vial format. Bristol Myers Squibb also recently announced it was working to sell its blood thinner medication Eliquis, which is co-owned with Pfizer, directly to patients.\n\nThe platforms not only offer some patients a cheaper price, they also fall in line with a Trump administration priority to lower drug prices by enabling DTC pharma sales at the \u201cmost-favored nation cost.\u201d The policy, as outlined in a May executive order from President Donald Trump, asks drugmakers to sell medications at the lowest price paid by an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country with a GDP per capita that\u2019s at least 60% of the U.S. measure.\n\nRoche is now considering its own DTC platform that would comply with the Trump administration\u2019s DTC desires. According to executives, the platform would potentially offer its future obesity products.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the BMS, Pfizer-type direct to patient, I think this is absolutely something that we would consider for the right product,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd one might imagine that this could be a really good type of program that you would use with your obesity assets.\u201d\n\nRoche Group CEO Thomas Schinecker added that DTC could also work for some of its other drugs, but he didn\u2019t go into detail about plans to launch its own platform and noted the company is in talks with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThere are other areas as well where we can do that, but these are discussions that we are having with the U.S. government,\u201d he said during the call.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Roche Refines Obesity Strategy, Eyes Direct-to-Patient Sales After Major Investments\n\n**Key details:** Roche is advancing CT-388, a weekly injectable dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, which showed 18.8% weight loss in a phase 1b trial. The company plans to announce a phase 3 study for CT-388 in obesity later this year. Roche also revealed it is cutting CT-173, an early-stage asset, from its obesity pipeline. Furthermore, Roche is considering launching a direct-to-patient (DTC) platform for future obesity products. This potential move aligns with Trump administration priorities to lower drug prices.\n\n**Why it matters:** Roche is clarifying its significant investment strategy in the lucrative obesity market by detailing its lead drug's progress and pipeline adjustments. The decision to cut CT-173 highlights a focused approach on assets with better developability and commercial viability. Roche's consideration of a direct-to-patient platform could challenge existing distribution models and pricing norms for obesity drugs. This move suggests a potential shift towards offering future products at lower prices, addressing market challenges like insurance coverage. It aligns with broader government priorities to reduce drug costs for patients.\n\n**The big picture:** Roche is actively working to enter the lucrative obesity market, having made significant investments including a $5 billion+ collaboration with Zealand Pharma and a $2.7 billion deal for Carmot Therapeutics. The company's strategy involves bringing differentiated assets to this competitive space. Other major pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer have already launched direct-to-patient platforms for their medications. These existing DTC platforms for obesity and diabetes drugs offer meds at about half the price in a vial format. The Trump administration has prioritized lowering drug prices through policies like \"most-favored nation cost\" for DTC pharma sales.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over $5 billion: Roche's collaboration deal with Zealand Pharma.\n*   $2.7 billion: Roche's deal to acquire Carmot Therapeutics in 2023.\n*   18.8%: Average weight loss over 24 weeks for CT-388 in a phase 1b trial.\n*   2026: Expected year for the initiation of a CT-388 and petrelintide combination study.\n*   Half the price: Medications available via DTC platforms are offered for about half the price in a vial format.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Roche:** Swiss pharma giant making significant investments and strategy adjustments in the obesity market.\n*   **Zealand Pharma:** Collaborated with Roche in a deal worth over $5 billion for obesity assets.\n*   **Carmot Therapeutics:** Acquired by Roche in 2023, providing early- and mid-stage obesity candidates.\n*   **Teresa Graham:** CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, discussed pipeline status and potential direct-to-patient platforms.\n*   **Thomas Schinecker:** Roche Group CEO, commented on the broader applicability of direct-to-patient models.\n*   **Pfizer:** Pharmaceutical company that has launched a direct-to-consumer platform for certain medications.\n*   **Eli Lilly:** Big Pharma company that launched direct-to-consumer offerings for obesity and diabetes drugs.\n*   **Novo Nordisk:** Big Pharma company that launched direct-to-consumer offerings for obesity and diabetes drugs.\n*   **Bristol Myers Squibb:** Announced plans to sell its co-owned blood thinner medication directly to patients.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President whose administration pushed for policies to lower drug prices through direct sales.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Roche plans to announce a phase 3 study for CT-388 in obesity later this year.\n*   Expectation for combo initiation of CT-388 and petrelintide is 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Roche hones obesity strategy, eyes direct sales and pipeline adjustments after major investments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nVenture capital firm Omega Funds closed a $647 million fund this month dedicated to supporting life sciences biotechs, bucking an industry trend that\u2019s seen a swift downturn in investing since the high-on-the-hog landscape of only five years ago.\n\nIn fact, biotech investors closed just four venture capital funds during the first quarter of 2025, according to new data from PitchBook. That\u2019s a huge drop in pace from 2021\u2019s peak of 309 total funds for the year.\n\nBut this downturn actually represents a post-bubble rightsizing of the market that will open up new opportunities not only for investors, but for promising technologies, according to Otello Stampacchia, Omegas\u2019 founder and managing director.\n\n\u201cThis creates a very good background for investing at great prices, in great companies,\u201d Stampacchia said.\n\nOther investors echo that sentiment.\n\nWhen Deerfield Management Company closed its latest healthcare innovations fund of over $600 million in May, the firm\u2019s managing partner, James Flynn, said there\u2019s \u201cnever been a better time to invest in new and evolving technologies and products across the life science, medical technology and healthcare service landscape.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with PharmaVoice, he elaborated on why the time felt right.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through a several-year period where valuations have gone down and competition for new assets has gone down, from an investment standpoint [that\u2019s] a good thing,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen you combine that with what are continual advances and knowledge of biology, continual advances in discovery tools, your ability to take those things forward in a cost effective and direct way improves.\u201d\n\nBiotech\u2019s new era of opportunity\n\nIt was actually harder to invest during the last biotech bubble because of so much \u201cnoise\u201d from competing investors, Stampacchia said.\n\n\u201cThere was so much enthusiasm from, in some cases, non-sophisticated, non-biotech specialist investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was actually a bit counterproductive.\u201d\n\nNot only were valuations \u201ca bit out of whack,\u201d but \u201cdiligence times were shorter, companies were awash in opportunity to get new investors in and discipline also went a bit out of the window,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy.\" Otello Stampacchia Founder, managing director, Omega Funds\n\nThe bubble could only burst after that glut of investing.\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a period of excess in 2019, 2020, where valuations went up very sharply and lots of companies that probably shouldn't have gone public went public,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen the correction occurred, none of them could raise money. They were all burning a huge amount of cash.\u201d\n\nStampacchia echoed this.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many public companies to attract investors\u2019 attention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a while, but there\u2019s been a steady reduction in those companies. Some of the great ones have been acquired. Some of the good ones will be acquired. Some of the terrible ones have done reverse mergers or returned cash to shareholders.\u201d\n\nCertainly technologies suffered from overhype, too.\n\n\u201cI think all the CRISPR craze was probably overdone,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cA whole bunch of companies went public. Some of them are continuing to progress, and we're starting to see some drugs out of them, but they became extremely heavily valued and had very high cash-burn with pretty speculative types of targets.\u201d\n\nStampacchia agrees that \u201cin today\u2019s environment, we think some modalities are trickier to justify\u201d and points to cell therapy as an example, thanks to \u201chuge logistic challenges, costs and difficulties to convert a certain type of physicians.\u201d\n\nAlthough Omega successfully invested in some early cell and gene therapy companies, Stampacchia said momentum in that arena has \u201cslowed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the bar is super high for us in that space,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sector\u2019s future\n\nAlthough there\u2019s still a lot of instability in the biotech market due to government funding cuts and policy uncertainty, investors who\u2019ve weathered the storm are being \u201cjudicious\u201d about where they put their money and attention.\n\n\u201cYou need to be disciplined. You need to know what you\u2019re doing. You need to really have a capacity of discerning great individuals and great drugs, which is not a given,\u201d Stampacchia said, noting that since its 2004 founding, Omega Funds has raised $2.5 billion and its portfolio companies launched 52 commercialized products.\n\nNow, with its newest $647 million Fund VIII \u2014 which exceeded its $600 million target \u2014 Omega aims to create and invest in life sciences companies in the U.S. and Europe that target severe, unmet medical needs.\n\nSpecifically, Omega will continue to be active in oncology and immunology, as well as some rare diseases, Stampacchia said. They\u2019re also \u201ccautiously\u201d making investments in the cardiometabolic space by being \u201cthoughtful\u201d about the unmet need.\n\nWhile Deerfield invests more widely across the healthcare space, Flynn said its areas of interest are very \u201cgenetics driven\u201d and include oncology and immunology.\n\nThe other four funds cited in PitchBook\u2019s report were from Ocampo Capital, Foundation Capital, 4BIO Capital and F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth. Although each of these new funds may face challenges, the downturn is likely good for the market in the long run.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy,\u201d Stampacchia said.",

        "summary": "**Omega Funds Bucks Biotech VC Trend With New $647M Fund**\n\n**Key details:** Venture capital firm Omega Funds closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs this month, defying a broad industry downturn. Only four biotech venture capital funds closed in Q1 2025, a steep drop from 309 total in 2021. Other investors, including Deerfield Management Company, also recently closed large funds over $600 million. These firms view the current downturn as a \"post-bubble rightsizing\" that creates new investment opportunities at attractive prices.\n\n**Why it matters:** This activity challenges the implied consensus that the biotech investment downturn signifies only risk or lack of opportunity. Investors like Omega and Deerfield believe the market \"cleansing period\" is healthy, reducing \"noise\" from non-specialist investors and overvalued companies. They highlight that lower valuations and reduced competition make it a prime time to invest in promising technologies. This suggests a strategic shift where disciplined capital finds value despite broader market instability.\n\n**The big picture:** The biotech market experienced a \"bubble\" from 2019-2020, characterized by sharp valuation increases and less disciplined investing. Many companies, some of which should not have gone public, struggled with cash burn after the correction. Overhyped technologies, including CRISPR and cell therapy, also saw speculative valuations and high cash burn. The current market downturn is seen as a necessary correction, reducing competition and allowing for more discerning investment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$647 million:** Size of Omega Funds' new fund (Fund VIII).\n*   **4:** Biotech VC funds closed in Q1 2025.\n*   **309:** Total biotech VC funds closed in 2021 (peak).\n*   **$600 million+:** Size of Deerfield Management Company's latest healthcare innovations fund.\n*   **$2.5 billion:** Total funds raised by Omega Funds since its 2004 founding.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Omega Funds:** Venture capital firm that successfully closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs.\n*   **Otello Stampacchia:** Founder and managing director of Omega Funds, who believes the downturn creates good investment conditions.\n*   **PitchBook:** Data provider referenced for statistics on venture capital fund closures in the biotech sector.\n*   **Deerfield Management Company:** Investment firm that closed a healthcare innovations fund over $600 million.\n*   **James Flynn:** Managing partner of Deerfield Management Company, who sees a great time to invest in new technologies.\n*   **PharmaVoice:** Publication where James Flynn shared his detailed views on the current investment climate.\n*   **Ocampo Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **Foundation Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **4BIO Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Savvy investors see biotech's downturn as a healthy market \"cleansing\" creating opportunities.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhen a bispecific antibody drug beat Keytruda in a Chinese lung cancer trial last year, excitement around the drug category skyrocketed, fueled by the tantalizing prospect of a newcomer unseating the megablockbuster.\n\nIvonescimab, which was developed by China-based Akeso and licensed to Summit Therapeutics, targets both PD-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that promotes blood vessel growth and shields tumors from the immune system. This dual-targeting approach \u2014 a hallmark of bispecific drugs \u2014 blocks immune evasion using PD-1 and cuts off the tumor\u2019s blood supply, which could pack a stronger cancer-fighting punch than either strategy alone.\n\nWhile the encouraging results in the Chinese phase 3 trial raised hopes ivonescimab and other drugs in the bispecific category could disrupt Keytruda\u2019s dominance in the oncology market, more recent data from a global trial of ivonescimab dampened that optimism. In the phase 3 study, the drug missed the key benchmark of overall survival. And even if future trials clear that hurdle, matching Keytruda\u2019s staggering success may still prove elusive, said Ethan Smith, therapy area director at Norstella.\n\n\u201cCan it become a $25 billion to $30 billion drug? I think that\u2019s a bit of a fantasy,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the candidate\u2019s other promising results have highlighted the rising potential of bispecifics to set new standards in cancer care.\n\nA rising drug class\n\nWhile Summit is leading the pack in bispecific antibody oncology contenders, ivonescimab isn\u2019t the only horse in the race. Among many contenders in the Big Pharma ranks vying for bispecific market share, companies like BioNTech, Merck & Co. and Pfizer boast several of the candidates in clinical development \u2014 a smattering compared to the overall space.\n\nBioNTech\u2019s BN327, acquired from Biotheus, differs from ivonescimab by targeting PD-L1 \u2014 instead of PD-1 \u2014 in addition to VEGF. It\u2019s in multiple phase 2 and phase 3 trials for lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, and has shown some favorable data. In June, the company announced it is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to test the drug in solid tumors as well.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging.\" Ethan Smith Therapy area director, Norstella\n\nKeytruda maker Merck is in early-phase testing with LM-299, which it licensed from LaNova Medicines. The company is looking to shore up its pipeline to compensate for an expected drop in Keytruda sales when a key patent expires in 2028 and the door opens to biosimilar competition.\n\nPfizer signed a $1.25 billion deal with 3SBio for SSG-707, another PD-1xVEGF that is poised to start phase 3 trials in China.\n\nSigns of promise and setbacks\n\nIn the meantime, the industry will be closely watching ivonescimab, the fate of which could become a bellwether for other bispecifics in development.\n\nMost recently, the drug demonstrated positive progression-free survival data in topline results from Summit\u2019s phase 3 global clinical trial released in May.\n\nThe results overall, however, were a mixed bag. Despite delaying tumor progression, the drug\u2019s 21% reduction in the risk of death was not considered statistically significant and \u201cdidn't translate to overall survival,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price dropped 20% on the news, contributing to a murky picture of the drug\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI think a physician would say this is clearly beneficial for patients. But it\u2019s not something that the FDA will approve unless the final data does become significant, which I think is an outside bet,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe FDA typically requires statistically significant survival data for full approval. Even so, Summit plans to submit an FDA filing, although the timing isn\u2019t clear.\n\nGoing forward, all eyes will be on ivonescimab\u2019s performance in the two upcoming trials, Smith said. Both studies pit the drug directly against Keytruda, not a placebo as in the original trial.\n\n\u201cThis will help answer the bigger question: Can it replace Keytruda?\u201d Smith said.\n\nFinal results from these trials won\u2019t be released until 2027 or 2028, although there will likely be some earlier signals from interim data. However, two factors make it unlikely that the bispecifics can ultimately best Keytruda outside of the clinic. First, the oncology market has become more segmented and personalized.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn addition, Summit is a relatively small company and may have difficulty pushing the drug to the dizzying heights experienced by Keytruda. Partnering with another company to gain additional resources could change the outlook, Smith said. And there\u2019s buzz that the company is trying to do just that with AstraZeneca, which has reportedly been in talks with Summit about a deal as high as $15 billion for the bispecific, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut ultimately, even though PD-1 VEGF drugs are likely to earn a place in the oncology market, they probably won\u2019t completely edge out Keytruda at its peak.\n\n\u201cIn indications that make sense, like small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, it can [become] a very strong alternative,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat would be easier to do in the U.S., but will be more challenging in Europe, where you've got cost-effectiveness challenges if you've got a marginal benefit with ivonescimab versus a [Keytruda] biosimilar.\u201d\n\nWhether bispecifics or another up-and-coming technology succeeds in the clinic, it\u2019s unlikely any new drug will achieve the same reach as Keytruda, Smith said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any oncology drug is going to be able to replicate what Keytruda has done,\u201d Smith said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Bispecific Cancer Drug Faces Hurdles Unseating Keytruda After Mixed Trial Results\n\n**Key details:**\nIvonescimab, a bispecific antibody drug developed by Akeso and licensed to Summit Therapeutics, showed encouraging results against Keytruda in an initial Chinese lung cancer trial. However, more recent data from a global phase 3 study \"dampened that optimism\" as the drug missed the key benchmark of overall survival. While it demonstrated positive progression-free survival, its 21% reduction in the risk of death was not statistically significant. Summit Therapeutics' share price dropped 20% on the news, creating a murky outlook for the drug's future.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe initial positive results for ivonescimab in China raised hopes that this bispecific category could disrupt Keytruda's long-standing dominance in the oncology market. However, the subsequent global trial's failure to meet the overall survival endpoint statistically challenges this optimistic consensus. This setback suggests that attaining broad FDA approval and replicating Keytruda's \"megablockbuster\" success will be significantly more challenging than initially anticipated. It signals that despite promise, bispecifics may not easily unseat established treatments, contrary to earlier high expectations.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBispecific antibody drugs represent a rising class in cancer care, aiming to provide a stronger therapeutic punch through dual-targeting mechanisms. Keytruda, currently a \"megablockbuster\" in oncology, faces patent expiration in 2028, which will open the door to biosimilar competition. Companies like Merck, BioNTech, and Pfizer are actively developing their own bispecific candidates to either shore up pipelines or gain market share. However, the increasingly segmented and personalized oncology market makes it \"super challenging\" for any single new drug to achieve Keytruda's widespread reach across multiple tumor types.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Ivonescimab's risk of death reduction: 21% (not statistically significant).\n*   Summit Therapeutics' share price drop: 20%.\n*   Keytruda's key patent expiration: 2028.\n*   Pfizer's deal with 3SBio for SSG-707: $1.25 billion.\n*   Potential AstraZeneca deal for ivonescimab: up to $15 billion (according to Bloomberg).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Akeso: China-based developer of ivonescimab, licensed its bispecific drug to Summit Therapeutics.\n*   Summit Therapeutics: Licensed ivonescimab, its share price dropped 20% after mixed global trial results.\n*   Ethan Smith: Therapy area director at Norstella, providing expert commentary on bispecifics' market potential.\n*   BioNTech: Developing bispecific BN327, partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb on solid tumors.\n*   Merck & Co.: Maker of Keytruda, developing LM-299 to offset anticipated sales drop post-patent.\n*   Pfizer: Signed $1.25 billion deal for SSG-707, a bispecific poised for phase 3 trials.\n*   AstraZeneca: Reportedly in talks for a $15 billion deal to partner with Summit on ivonescimab.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   All eyes will be on ivonescimab's performance in two upcoming trials directly pitting it against Keytruda.\n*   Final results from these pivotal trials are not expected until 2027 or 2028.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMixed data suggests bispecifics unlikely to replicate Keytruda's broad market reach.",

Which was a major rise in growth momentum, and the sudden interest certainly grabbed the attention of investors, as well as the broader tech community.\n\nBut since then, Bluesky\u2019s growth has largely returned to the mean.\n\nIt added another 10 million users between November 2024 and March 2025, taking it to 30 million total actives.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s reached 38 million, after another 5 months.\n\nSo Bluesky has gone from adding around 5 million new users per month at peak, to adding 1.6 million per month more recently.\n\nWhich, again, is still growth, and with so many apps struggling to gain users, any increase, especially of a million or more per month, is significant. But it\u2019s no longer looking like Bluesky will become a real challenger to X (currently on 600 million users) and Threads (350 million) as a key platform for in-the-moment engagement.\n\nSo who is using Bluesky, and should you be on it?\n\nWell, that depends.\n\nBased on its current trending topics display, there\u2019s a range of trending topics being discussed in the app, though the conversation volume is fairly limited.\n\nWhich makes sense, because the data also shows that Bluesky\u2019s overall post volume is declining, despite it adding more users.\n\nIndeed, some reports have suggested that many have abandoned Bluesky due to the overall lack of activity, and it could be that there\u2019s just not enough there to make it a key focus, at least not as a significant driver of engagement.\n\nBut there\u2019s no central repository of Bluesky trends, and as such, the only way to know for sure is to search for your focus topics, and see what\u2019s being said in the app. If there\u2019s a lot of engagement, it may be worth your time.\n\nBut the data would suggest that, for most topics, that\u2019s probably unlikely.\n\nBluesky certainly has a dedicated core fanbase, and again, it is still seemingly adding users. But that core group isn\u2019t building major momentum as yet.\n\nThat could change, especially if Bluesky can get more exclusive content into its app, though with overall post volume declining, it\u2019s seemingly going in the opposite direction for now.\n\nAnd with costs mounting, eventually, Bluesky will have to reassess its approach. Which will likely include paid add-ons, that its core user base will pay for in support.\n\nBut will that be enough to keep the lights on long term?",

So it\u2019s now a requirement that all platforms implement some form of age checking, in order to protect youngsters from potentially harmful exposure in their apps.\n\nAnd while X has opposed the regulation, saying that it infringes free speech, it seems to have now conceded that, one way or another, it will need to abide by the law. And with other regions considering similar restrictions, it\u2019s very likely going to have to implement some form of age checking either way, even if it may be able to successfully challenge the U.K. bill.\n\nX actually took the first steps towards actioning this late last month, by outlining a range of new age assurance measures, including crosschecking account holder info, and X Premium subscription status.\n\nWithin that, X also noted that it would soon be adding:\n\nFacial age estimation: Users can upload a live selfie, which will be used to estimate their age by our artificial intelligence systems.\n\nID verification: Users can submit a government-issued ID, which will be used to estimate their age by our artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIt\u2019s now taking steps to enable the first element, though unlike Meta, which has outsourced this to a third party age verification provider, X is looking to use its own AI tools to measure user ages from images.\n\nAs you can see in these example screens, posted by @swak_12 (and X Daily News), X is building a native selfie process for its age checks, in which it also notes that X and xAI will use your selfie image for age checking.\n\nAnother screen shows that its age-checking system will be powered by Grok.\n\nHow good X\u2019s systems are at determining age, we don\u2019t know, but X seems confident that it\u2019ll be able to meet the requirements of the new law by implementing its own age verification process.\n\nThough already, in other apps, many users have found ways around this.\n\nAs reported by Engadget last week:\n\n\u201cSavvy internet users are already circumventing the age checks by using a VPN, providing a fake ChatGPT-generated photo ID, or taking a high-quality selfie of video game characters.\u201d\n\nYeah, there seems to be a few flaws in the process. And this is based on third-party age verification systems that have been specifically built for this purpose, so I can\u2019t imagine that X\u2019s Grok tool is going to be any better at this.\n\nWhich further underlines the need for an approved, universal age checking provider process, which would see all the platforms measured to the same standard, as opposed to each coming up with its own, variable approach.\n\nBecause as it stands, it can\u2019t see how this will be legally enforceable, especially if a platform is able to prove that a better-resourced competitor has an advantage in meeting these requirements.\n\nThere needs to be a singular, government-vetted system that\u2019s then provided to the platforms to ensure adherence. Otherwise, it\u2019s not going to work, and I have even more confidence in saying that xAI\u2019s system is not going to be foolproof.\n\nBut it\u2019ll probably meet the standards, and that might deter some kids from trying it.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s a win, but it feels like a half measure.",

        "summary_text": "Amid varying reports suggesting that Google\u2019s AI overviews are rapidly eroding referral traffic, Google has responded by saying that this concern is essentially being overblown, because not only are users happier with its AI overviews, it actually hasn\u2019t seen a significant decline in total referral links being sent from Google Search results.\n\nWhich, of course, Google would say, but according to its official blog post, there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s seeing to support such claims.\n\nWell, at least in terms of overall referral numbers.\n\nAs per Google:\n\n\u201cOverall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year. Additionally, average click quality has increased and we\u2019re actually sending slightly more quality clicks to websites than a year ago (by quality clicks, we mean those where users don\u2019t quickly click back \u2014 typically a signal that a user is interested in the website). This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic \u2014 often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search.\u201d\n\nAmong those reports, and the one that Google\u2019s specifically taking aim at, is a recent study published by Pew Research, which was based on search history data from a pool 0f 900 users.\n\nPew\u2019s data showed that users who had encountered an AI summary in the SERP clicked on a traditional search result link in 8% of all sessions, while those who didn\u2019t see an AI summary clicked on a search result nearly twice as often (15%).\n\nThat seems significant, and marks a significant shift in search activity, and the study has been widely quoted and held up as an example of the broader impacts of Google\u2019s AI shift.\n\nBut Google has specifically called this one out as being based on flawed input, due to its relatively small study pool.\n\nI mean, I guess 900 users is a small sample size, especially when you consider that billions of people are using Google every day. But as an indicative measure, the data here would likely suggest that there\u2019s been at least some relative impact on referrals. Right?\n\nGoogle says no.\n\n\u201cWith AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.\u201d\n\nSo AI previews are actually better for referral traffic, in Google\u2019s view, and while it does concede some impact:\n\n\u201cFor some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like \u2018when is the next full moon,\u2019 people may be satisfied with the initial response and not click further. This has also been true for other answer features we\u2019ve added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase.\u201d\n\nIts main contention is that while traffic is declining to some sites, it\u2019s increasing to others, including those with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts, which are all seeing an uptick in Google traffic.\n\n\u201cPeople are also more likely to click into web content that helps them learn more \u2014 such as an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective or a thoughtful first-person analysis. Sites that meet these evolving user needs are benefiting from this shift and are generally seeing an increase in traffic.\u201d\n\nSo Reddit. Reddit is seeing more traffic, and you\u2019ve no doubt seen more Reddit links appearing in SERPs.\n\nBut still, maybe these notes provides some guidance as to what you should be including on your sites to better cater to AI previews, and evolving search behaviors. Though it\u2019s also notable that Google hasn\u2019t shared any specific data points to back these claims up.\n\nGoogle\u2019s just saying that it\u2019s all fine, that you\u2019re probably not losing traffic, and if you are, others are winning out.\n\nSo it\u2019s all good, the broader web is better off overall. Enough with the fear mongering, right?\n\nWell, no.\n\nBecause as noted, that still means that many sites are losing traffic, and that\u2019s having a big impact on many businesses.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, for example, reported back in June that organic search traffic has declined for every major news organization. Based on data provided by Similarweb, WSJ says that HuffPost\u2019s organic search traffic has dropped by more than half over the past three years, while The Washington Post and Business Insider have seen similar patterns.\n\n\u201cBusiness Insider\u2019s traffic from Google searches alone dropped 55% between April 2022 and April 2025, based on data from Similarweb.\u201d\n\nThat, among other factors, forced Business Insider to cut staff by 21% back in June, citing \u201cextreme traffic drops\u201d as one of the challenges it\u2019s facing.\n\nA pessimist could say that this was opportunistic, as Business Insider is also experimenting with ChatGPT for content creation, and it may well be using this as a reason to back up its push to reduce staff. But the decline in overall traffic is undeniable, and is going to impact all businesses that make money from Google Ads and the like.\n\nAnd there are various other reports:\n\nThe Current recently reported that traffic to the world\u2019s 500 most visited publishers dropped 27% year-over-year versus February last year\n\nLast month, Digiday reported that since the U.S. launch of Google\u2019s AI Overviews in May 2024, the number of searches for news that result in no click-throughs to new s websites has grown from 56% to nearly 69%\n\nAuthoritas found that a site previously ranked first in a search result could lose about 79% of its traffic for that query if results were delivered below an AI overview.\n\nThat said, SimilarWeb, a key reference point for a lot of this type of data, has also reported that AI referrals to websites have increased by 357% since June 2024, which may support what Google\u2019s saying about a re-distribution of Search traffic, as opposed to the top publishers taking up all the SERP space.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if that\u2019ll offset the losses that are being reported, but maybe, this is indicative of Google\u2019s statements.\n\nThough the concern remains. Even based on Google\u2019s explanation, many sites are indeed losing out, and will have to reassess their traffic generation process.\n\nAnd with AI Overviews only currently being displayed for 20% of desktop searches, there\u2019s also the question of what happens as Google increases this, and how that will impact the broader web.\n\nGoogle says that it \u201ccares passionately about the web ecosystem,\u201d and that it\u2019s very mindful of these impacts.\n\nBut right now, Google says, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nIn overall terms, at least.",

It simplifies a complex journey into a neat, clickable endpoint, and in doing so, seduces marketers into believing that they\u2019ve found truth. But it\u2019s not how people actually buy. Last-touch ignores everything that happens before the final click: brand equity, creative exposure, social discovery, offline influence, even economic context.\u201d\n\nThe report highlights the challenges in accurate attribution, with marketing budgets often being allocated to the wrong elements based on a misunderstanding of the path to purchase:\n\nIndeed, the report suggests that 60% of underperforming marketers are focused on lower-funnel conversion, while 35% of last-click attribution spend generates zero incremental sales.\n\nIn order to measure the right elements, marketers need to take a more holistic view of measurement, and employ smarter solutions.\n\nWhich is where its \u201cGRO\u201d model comes in:\n\nThe GRO measurement model aims to better track performance and attribution through more targeted process.\n\nThe first element is \u201cGoals,\u201d which relates to the setting of defined targets related to brand performance.\n\n\u201cReadiness\u201d meanwhile relates to defined measurables that you can apply to your learnings.\n\nAnd finally, \u201cOptimization\u201d takes an evidence-based approach to improving your key data points, based on the information that you can access.\n\nThe report breaks down each element in a lot more detail, providing a framework for improved performance tracking, which could help in your efforts to maximize performance, based on a more expansive set of touchpoint and interactive data.\n\nEssentially, the framework aims to take in more data points, as opposed to relying on low funnel measures, in order to better understand customer journeys, and the contribution of various elements in the process.\n\nIt could give you some additional considerations for your process.\n\nYou can download the full WARC/TikTok guidebook (with email sign-up) here.",

When consumers encounter marketing efforts that feel familiar and relevant, they\u2019re more likely to take notice, driving not only feelings of value, recognition and exclusivity that foster loyalty but also boosting conversion rates and overall customer satisfaction.\u201d\n\nIndeed, according to a 2024 study by Deloitte, 80% of U.S. consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences.\n\nIn addition to this, 78% of consumers want personalization that saves them money, while 73% of EU consumers responded positively to seeing an ad with useful information for a product/service they intended on buying.\n\nSo there are clear benefits, and the report highlights the how and why of establishing personalization within your marketing process, and how you can build trust with your audience through such measures.\n\nThe report also looks at the fundamentals of using personalization in a considered manner, which imbues trust with your customers.\n\nWhile there are also notes on how brands can enact a responsible, and responsive, personalization plan, which aligns with both concerns about data collection, and the capacity to intake user info.\n\nThe report essentially provides a framework for an effective personalization strategy, while also arguing the benefits of such, and why regulators should allow responsible brands to utilize this info.\n\nWhich, again, likely relates to Meta\u2019s ongoing argument with EU authorities over their increasingly stringent data protection rules, and restrictions on Meta\u2019s ad models around such.\n\nAnd the case is compelling, while there are also some valuable considerations for brands looking to ensure that they use customer data in a responsible way.\n\nYou can download the full \u201cPath to Personalization\u201d report here.",

And with fewer people posting original content, social platforms have become more interest-based, as opposed to expressive, so it makes sense that IG might be able to facilitate more connection around what people are interested in, as opposed to what they share.\n\nMeta\u2019s also presumably seeing some erosion in its user interest graphs, because with algorithms now showing you a constant stream of content that it thinks you\u2019ll like, you no longer need to like and follow in order to dictate such, as the systems are now much better at inferring interest based on your viewing activity. Direct indicators do still play a role, but users are growing more accustomed to automated refinement, which is likely having some impact on Meta\u2019s capacity to understand user interests for ad targeting and the like.\n\nSo maybe, something like Picks works to provide more context, as well as expanded engagement activity.\n\nIt seems like an interesting experiment either way.

        "summary_text": "Instagram has officially launched three new features that it\u2019s been testing for some time, with re-posts, friend map and a \u201cFriends\u201d tab in the Reels feed now available to all users.\n\nFirst off, on re-posts, which is probably the most contentious of the three. And not because of the function itself, re-posts are obviously fairly common across social platforms. But for years, Instagram has resisted adding a re-posting option, for fear that it might discourage original posting activity.\n\nApparently, that\u2019s not so much of a concern now.\n\nAs explained by Instagram:\n\n\u201cWith reposts, you can repost public reels and feed posts, making it easier for you to share your interests with your friends. Reposts will be recommended to your friends\u2019 and followers\u2019 feeds, and they\u2019ll also be in a separate tab on your profile, so you can always go back to revisit your reposts.\u201d\n\nAs you can see in these example images, IG re-posts will include an image of the re-posting user\u2019s profile picture, with a purple re-post icon layered on top of that.\n\nInstagram\u2019s also adding a \u201cRe-posts\u201d tab on user profiles, where you\u2019ll be able to see all of the content that each user has re-shared, with any comments they\u2019ve added also layered on top of the thumbnail image.\n\nWhich could fundamentally alter how Instagram works, and see your feed become a mix of AI-recommended Reels and random re-posts from people you\u2019re connected to.\n\nWhich Instagram has been trying to highlight for some time either way. Earlier this year, Instagram added a new prompt to see Reels that your friends have liked, while it first began live testing of re-posts back in March.\n\nSo it\u2019s been moving towards this for some time, in what many view as a significant shift in approach for the app.\n\nInstagram says that Reposts are credited to the original poster:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a creator, this means that if your content is reposted by someone else, it may be recommended to that person\u2019s followers, even if those people don\u2019t follow you. This gives creators a new opportunity to reach more people whenever you create something worth sharing.\u201d\n\nWhich is how IG\u2019s looking to angle this, as a means to boost creator reach, and maybe, there will be benefit to that. Last week, Meta also reported that over two-thirds of recommended content on Instagram (in the U.S.) now comes from original posts, and this could be another element in its broader push to boost original creators, and enhance its relationship with influential users.\n\nBut it does seem strange that Instagram was so resistant to the concept for so long, but now it\u2019s fine.\n\nThough, I guess, on balance, fewer people are posting to IG anyway, so maybe it\u2019s less of a concern that this will discourage original content sharing.\n\nEither way, Meta\u2019s balanced this concern versus potential creator benefit and gone with the latter, which could have a significant impact on your IG experience.\n\nNext up is Instagram\u2019s answer to the Snap Map, with a new, opt-in \u201cFriends Map\u201d display, which will show where your friends are at any given time.\n\nAs you can see in this example, the IG Friends Map will be available via the Notes feed at the top of your inbox, enabling you to access a display of all of your friends who have their location tracking switched on in the app.\n\n\u201cYou can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime. You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a user\u2019s live location, the map will also display any content with a location tagged, including Reels, posts, Stories and Notes.\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s Snap Map, in IG form, which could be a handy option, especially when you consider that almost half of all Snap users (400 million) use the feature.\n\nInstagram\u2019s been testing this for a long time, with the first indicators of the feature spotted in testing in November 2023. IG launched a live test of the map in August last year, and it\u2019s now seemingly happy with the safety features and controls, which is why it\u2019s moving to a broader release.\n\nThough it\u2019s also keen to highlight your control options for such.\n\nInstagram says that users can choose who they share their location with, while you can also choose to not share your location in specific places or with specific people. Parents will also have oversight into how their kids share their location in the app, and optional control over whether their child can access the option.\n\nWhich is important, because:\n\n\u201cIf you use location sharing, your location is updated whenever you open the app or return to the app if it\u2019s been running in the background.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019ll auto-update if you\u2019ve opted in, which is the same as Snap, though Snapchat does give you a prompt to let you know when location tracking is active whenever you log in. Presumably, IG will do the same.\n\nFinally, Instagram\u2019s also adding a new \u201cFriends\u201d tab in Reels, which will display public content that your friends have interacted with, and/or recommendations from Blends that you\u2019ve started.\n\nWhich is an expansion of the aforementioned listing of Reels that your friends have liked, which Instagram added back in January.\n\nIt seems that Instagram\u2019s seen good engagement in displaying what\u2019s trending within friend groups, so it\u2019s looking to extrapolate that to its own feed.\n\nAs you can see in the above screenshots, the new \u201cFriends\u201d feed will be accessible via a listing at the top of the screen. Just like TikTok, though the feed is also populated with content that friends have liked, as opposed to only their posts.\n\nInstagram says that users will have some control over what\u2019s displayed here, so they don\u2019t have to display everything that they\u2019ve liked to a broader audience, while it\u2019s also added a mute option for content recommendations from users you\u2019re less interested in.\n\nIt could be another way to expand discovery, and encourage engagement through shared interests.\n\nSo, three new features, that aren\u2019t really new, as they\u2019ve all been in live testing for some time. But now we\u2019ll see how a wider audience responds to them, which could have a big impact on your IG process.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Instagram Rolls Out Re-posts, Friends Map, and New Reels Tab\n\n**Key details:** Instagram officially launched three new features: re-posts, Friend Map, and a \"Friends\" tab in the Reels feed. Re-posts allow sharing public content to followers' feeds and a separate profile tab. Friend Map is an opt-in display showing friends' live location, and the \"Friends\" tab shows content friends interacted with and Blends recommendations.\n\n**Why it matters:** These features could fundamentally alter how Instagram works, representing a significant shift in its approach. Instagram previously resisted re-posts due to fear of discouraging original content, but now aims to boost creator reach. This challenges its long-held stance on content sharing.\n\n**The big picture:** Instagram has been moving towards these changes for some time, with re-posts tested since March and the Friends Map since November 2023. This aligns with Meta's broader push to boost original creators and enhance relationships with influential users. The new features have been in live testing and are now released more broadly.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Observe how a wider audience responds to the newly launched features.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Instagram's new features could fundamentally alter user experience and content strategy.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over two-thirds of recommended Instagram content in the U.S. comes from original posts.\n*   Almost half (400 million) of all Snap users utilize the Snap Map feature.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   * Instagram: Officially launched three new features including re-posts, Friends Map, and a Reels tab.\n*   * Meta: Instagram's parent company, balancing creator benefit versus original content concerns for features.\n*   * Snap: Its \"Snap Map\" feature served as a comparable model for Instagram's new Friends Map.\n*   * TikTok: Its feed is referenced as a comparison point for Instagram's new \"Friends\" feed.",

Meta\u2019s metaverse vision involves the use of digital depictions like this to interact with its expanded digital worlds, and as such, it\u2019s constantly refining and improving its avatar tools to give you more ways to customize your depiction.\n\nIndeed, last week, Meta added new body types, avatar poses and emotes.\n\nIt\u2019s also updated its avatar editor in the Horizon mobile app, which enables you to refresh your character\u2019s style via conversational AI prompts\u201d\n\nMeta Horizon Creator Partners can also now upload custom textures or use generative AI retexturing tools to design bespoke avatar clothing in the Horizon Creator Portal, while there are also new parametric face controls for more customization.\n\n\u201cAdd to that hairstyles, facial hair options, makeup and face paint, freckles and beauty marks, bindis, and beyond, and you\u2019ve got billions upon billions of combinations and permutations to create the perfect avatar.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve been a massive hit as yet, but definitely more people are using their Meta avatars in more places, especially in custom stickers and Facebook posts.\n\nAnd now, you can experiment with multiple avatars at once, so you can try out new options and styles and see if you find them to be a better fit.",

        "summary_text": "Snapchat has published its latest performance report, which, in the topline results at least, shows steady increases in users and revenue, as it continues to refine its business offerings, and capitalize on its market opportunities.\n\nThough growth in key markets remains a challenge, with Snap continuing to lose users in the North American market, its key revenue source, while rising costs also continue to weigh on its overall results.\n\nAnd its revenue results are also not great.\n\nFirst off, on users. Snapchat reached 469 million daily active users in Q2, an increase of 9 million on its Q1 numbers.\n\nAgain, any growth is a positive, but the fact that Snap is losing users in the U.S. is a standout note from this chart. Almost all of Snap\u2019s growth is still coming from the \u201cRest of World\u201d category, with India in particular seeing more take-up. But the U.S. and EU is where Snap generates the majority of its revenue, and as such, the stagnant results here are potentially problematic.\n\nAs you can see in these charts, Snap generates almost 4x more revenue per user from its North American audience, and 800% more than those in the \u201cRest of World\u201d segment.\n\nBuilding in more markets obviously bodes well for future opportunities, as these regions continue to develop their digital economies. But the steady decline of Snap usage in the U.S. points to a plateau, and a potential cap on Snap\u2019s growth.\n\nBut of course, Snap\u2019s keen to focus on the positives, with the platform also inching closer to a billion monthly actives, with 932 million monthly active users (MAU), an increase of 32 million on Q1.\n\nAnd overall, the fact that Snap is still adding millions more users is an indicator of its enduring relevance and resonance, particularly among younger users.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how the market responds to such.\n\nOn the revenue front, Snap brought in $1.3 billion for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nBut again, you can see the impact of its U.S. audience decline here, with its North American revenue down on Q1, while it\u2019s also posted its lowest revenue result in four quarters.\n\nAnd while Snap is focused on its next-level bets, like AR glasses, it needs to keep generating revenue to maximize this element, and the chart trends here don\u2019t look great.\n\nIncluding this one:\n\nIn terms of specific business offerings, Snap says that it\u2019s seeing good results with Sponsored Snaps, which are now driving an 18% lift in unique conversions across app installs and app purchases.\n\nSnap says that it\u2019s also seeing more engagement with its Spotlight short-form video offering, with time spent in the Spotlight feed rising 23% year-over-year, facilitating more exposure options. Indeed, Snap says that Spotlight now contributes more than 40% of total content time spent in the app, which could be worth noting for your video ads.\n\nSnap\u2019s also been working to integrate more creator content, via its Snap Stars program, with the number of Spotlight posts by Snap Stars growing more than 145% year-over-year in North America in Q2.\n\nSo there are, at least in theory, opportunities there, and if Snap can facilitate more brand partnerships, leading to creator monetization and increased exposure potential for brands, there will still be value on this front, even if overall usage dips.\n\nSnap also notes that use of its Snap Map has grown to more than 400 million MAU, and with expanded promotional options being integrated here, that could be another area of opportunity.\n\nBut it\u2019s Snapchat\u2019s AR project, and the costs associated with it, that remain a point of contention.\n\nBack in June, Snapchat announced that it\u2019ll release its AR-enabled Spectacles next year, in an effort to beat Meta to market with a functional, fashionable AR device.\n\nWhich makes sense, as the indicators are that Meta\u2019s glasses will be more functional, fashionable and cheaper, but the cost of that project is likely a significant contributor to Snap\u2019s increasing infrastructure costs, along with its own AI projects.\n\nBut Snap\u2019s not building its own AI tools, it\u2019s mostly hosting AI experiences from OpenAI and Google, in order to power things like its \u201cMy AI\u201d chatbot. As such, the majority of its costs would likely be going towards this AR glasses push, which makes sense in the broader scale of Snap\u2019s long-term plan.\n\nBut in practice, it seems like this could be a disaster for the business.\n\nSure, Snap users are still interested in AR, with Snap reporting that more than 350 million Snapchatters now engage with its AR tools every day, and Snap continues to add more innovative AR uses, like its recent integration with a TV show in the U.K.\n\nBut will they also buy Snap\u2019s AR glasses, and if they do, will Snap be able to maintain momentum for such as Meta continues to inch closer to a launch of its AR device.\n\nI don\u2019t think that this is a race Snap can win, and Snap might be better off developing AR experiences for other devices, as opposed to investing in its own, which is looking like a major cash drain, for what may well be only a short-term boost in interest.\n\nSnap\u2019s net loss for Q2 was $263 million, compared to $249 million in the prior year. And as the costs continue to rise, and user growth remains a question, this seems like a big point of concern for the app.",

Revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. However, the company continues to lose users in its key North American market, its primary revenue source, and North American revenue was down on Q1. Q2 revenue was also its lowest in four quarters, and rising costs, particularly from its AR glasses project, contributed to a net loss of $263 million.\n\n**Why it matters:** While topline numbers suggest overall growth, Snap's declining user base in North America is problematic as this region generates significantly more revenue per user. This challenges the perceived stability of its profitable revenue streams and suggests a potential cap on growth. The increasing net loss, driven by rising costs from its AR project, indicates that high investment in future initiatives might be a \"major cash drain\" rather than a clear path to sustained profitability, potentially alarming investors.\n\n**The big picture:** Snapchat is focusing on refining business offerings and capitalizing on market opportunities, especially in regions like India, where user growth is strong.

Outsourced linehaul miles dropped significantly to 6.8% of total miles in Q2, compared to 15.9% a year ago. The company attributes these savings to recent investments in rolling stock and its ability to operate more efficiently than third-party contractors. New AI-powered linehaul models are also driving savings, reducing normalized linehaul miles by 3% and empty miles by over 10%.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nXPO's ability to achieve significant cost reductions and efficiency gains during a market slowdown challenges the idea that companies in this sector are solely reliant on strong demand. By insulating its cost structure from purchased transportation, XPO is positioning itself for greater benefit when demand recovers and truckload rates potentially increase by 20-40%. This proactive approach, including substantial investments in AI, demonstrates a strategic effort to improve profitability and operational control independently of market conditions. These internal efficiencies could provide a competitive advantage regardless of broader economic shifts.\n\n**The big picture:**\nXPO's Chief Strategy Officer stated that investments in rolling stock have allowed the carrier to cut outsourcing costs in the short term.

He has served in various key financial and operational roles, including CFO, prior to his promotion. This executive shuffle occurs against a backdrop of the company experiencing sustained operating losses.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   August 4: Effective date of Lance Stewart's promotion to CEO.\n*   June 27: Effective date of former CEO Joseph Vitiritto's resignation.\n*   Three straight quarters: Duration PAMT has faced operating losses.\n*   $11.1 million: PAMT's operating losses for Q2.\n*   $9.6 million: PAMT's net loss for Q2.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **PAMT:** Parent company of P.A.M. Transport, undergoing significant executive leadership changes amidst financial losses.\n*   **Lance Stewart:** Promoted to president, CEO, and director of PAMT, effective August 4.\n*   **P.A.M. Transport:** Primary subsidiary of PAMT, where new CEO Lance Stewart began his career in 1989.\n*   **Joseph Vitiritto:** Former CEO of PAMT who resigned effective June 27 due to family reasons.\n*   **Matthew Moroun:** Served as interim CEO for PAMT and will now return to his role as chairman.\n*   **Daniel Kleine:** Promoted to SVP of finance and treasurer for PAMT, acting as principal financial and accounting officer.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A permanent CFO needs to be named for PAMT.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPAMT shakes up leadership following sustained operating losses.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\n3 Big Numbers is a weekly column that looks at a few key details from around the c-store industry.\n\nSeven & i Holdings, the Japanese company that owns 7-Eleven, has been having a rough time lately.\n\nConcerns about the company\u2019s overall performance have led to disgruntled shareholders putting pressure on leaders to either make big changes or consider Alimentation Couche-Tard\u2019s bid to buy it out.\n\nSeven & i has taken some drastic steps this year, including naming its first non-Japanese CEO in Stephen Dacus and planning to take its North American arm, 7-Eleven Inc., public in 2026.\n\nAmid all this, the company has outlined a number of goals, including cutting costs and boosting foodservice, delivery and private label sales.\n\nIn this week\u2019s \u201c3 Big Numbers,\u201d we look at three areas where 7-Eleven has made progress on its long-term plans in North America.\n\n$245 million 7-Eleven\u2019s Q1 operating income.\n\nOperating income for 7-Eleven grew from $201 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to $245 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025, according to Seven & i\u2019s earnings presentation. That\u2019s more than a 20% increase.\n\nChallenges persisted, however, as same-store sales were down 1%. But the growth came largely from increased merchandise gross product margins and a small decrease in non-production costs, such as administrative salaries or rents.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the margin increase for a moment and focus on the cost savings. 7-Eleven targeted $500 million in cost savings last year and managed to surpass that by cutting spending by $562 million during fiscal 2024. The focus on fiscal discipline is continuing into this year, with the company looking to make further cuts ahead of the proposed 2026 IPO.\n\n435 The number of 7-Eleven stores where food and beverage programs were modernized in Q1.\n\n7-Eleven\u2019s foot traffic was down 6% in Q1 year over year, according to the earnings presentation. While that\u2019s never great, 7-Eleven was able to offset this drop in a couple ways.\n\nFirst, its average basket size in the first quarter was up 5.3%. Second, the company boosted its gross product margins by 1.1% in the quarter.\n\nWhile these margin gains came from multiple areas, they were mainly a result of the company\u2019s focus on growing proprietary products. It saw better margins from fresh food and private label goods.\n\nThe company has rolled out modernized food and beverage programs to 435 sites so far in fiscal 2025. While the rollout is expected to slow for the rest of the year, 7-Eleven is expected to modernize the offering in another 1,000 stores. This modernization includes adding hot grab-and-go cases as well as racks of bakery items.\n\nPrivate label plus updated coffee programs and an expansion in the number of stores that include restaurants show that whether or not it works, 7-Eleven is remaining focused on improving its reputation among food-seeking patrons.\n\n18.2% The year-over-year increase in same-store delivery sales for 7-Eleven in Q1.\n\n7-Eleven only added delivery to 74 stores during the quarter, but that\u2019s understandable when delivery is already available in over half of the company\u2019s locations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is the increasing use of delivery at stores that have already had it for a while.\n\nSame-store delivery sales \u2014 that is, sales growth among stores that already had delivery during fiscal Q1 in 2024 \u2014 were up over 18% year over year. The average basket size for these orders was more than $15.\n\nIf 7-Eleven can keep growing these sales, or even just maintaining these basket sizes white the number of stores offering delivery grows, the incremental sales will have an even bigger impact on the bottom line.",

This growth stemmed from increased merchandise gross product margins and cost reductions. The company modernized food and beverage offerings in 435 stores and saw same-store delivery sales jump 18.2% year-over-year. Average delivery basket size exceeded $15. The company also surpassed its fiscal 2024 cost savings target, cutting spending by $562 million.\n\n**Why it matters:** These Q1 results highlight 7-Eleven\u2019s progress in North America despite overall performance concerns and shareholder pressure for drastic changes or a buyout. The growth in operating income, driven by margin gains and cost cuts, suggests internal initiatives are yielding results. Increased delivery sales and modernized food programs aim to improve profitability and customer appeal. This performance could challenge the perception that the company is solely struggling, showing tangible steps towards operational improvement.\n\n**The big picture:** Seven & i Holdings, 7-Eleven's parent company, has faced a challenging period marked by shareholder dissatisfaction. This pressure has prompted major strategic shifts, including appointing Stephen Dacus as CEO and planning a 2026 IPO for 7-Eleven Inc.

        "summary": "**Schneider Implements Early Peak Surcharges Amidst Tariff-Driven Demand Surge**\n\n**Key details:** Schneider National has already placed peak season surcharges for its intermodal business, executing them about six to eight weeks ahead of its normal schedule. The company is initiating similar conversations with its truckload customers. This move aims to manage operations and incremental costs, preventing a few customers from disrupting its network. Schneider's intermodal business saw revenues, excluding fuel surcharge, increase 5% year over year, driven by a 5% volume growth, with evidence of customers \"pulling forwards\" activity into Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:** Schneider's early surcharges signal an unusual peak season driven by customer demand reacting to global trade complexities and developing tariff policies. This information challenges a simple \"demand is up\" consensus, as DAT Freight & Analytics suggests an earlier peak season could present challenges for carriers. While customers are surging up now, frontloading efforts since last September could lead to flat volumes for the rest of the year, potentially impacting carrier profitability beyond the initial surge.\n\n**The big picture:** Shippers are responding to ongoing global trade complexities and evolving tariff policies by frontloading efforts to mitigate potential challenges. This behavior has led to an uptick in demand for some carriers earlier than typical. Both Schneider National and J.B. Hunt Transport Services have reacted by implementing peak season surcharges ahead of schedule. These carriers are trying to manage costs and ensure operational stability in response to this anticipated volatility.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Schneider's intermodal surcharges were executed \"about six to eight weeks ahead\" of when it normally does.\n*   Schneider's intermodal business saw revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increase \"5% year over year.\"\n*   This revenue growth was driven by volume growth of \"5%.\"\n*   Shippers have been bringing imports earlier \"since last September\" at high volumes.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Schneider National:** A carrier that has implemented early peak season surcharges for intermodal and truckload services.\n*   **Jim Filter:** Schneider's EVP and group president of transportation and logistics, who discussed the early surcharges and demand drivers.\n*   **Mark Rourke:** President and CEO of Schneider, who noted difficulty quantifying Q2 \"pull forwards\" but observed evidence.\n*   **J.B.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Ryder sees supply chain activity rise while other segments lag.\n\n**Key details:** Ryder System reported an uptick in decision-making among its supply chain customers in Q2. CEO Robert Sanchez noted a pickup in sales for the Supply Chain side but not for the Dedicated and Leasing segments. Customers in these latter segments continue to delay decisions due to ongoing tariff announcements from the Trump administration. This hesitation has carried over from Q1, though the passage of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" clarified some initial uncertainty.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information highlights a divergence in customer behavior within Ryder's various business segments, which could be significant for investors. The increased decision-making in Supply Chain Solutions suggests that some customers are moving past general market uncertainty. However, continued delays in Dedicated and Leasing indicate that the broader freight downturn and tariff uncertainty still hinder long-term commitments in other areas. This challenges a potential consensus view that all segments would be uniformly impacted by current economic conditions.\n\n**The big picture:** Market uncertainty, including a freight recession and U.S. tariff policy, has prolonged decision delays for shippers. Ryder noted customer hesitation on signing long-term contracts since Q1, particularly for cross-border shippers. While President Donald Trump\u2019s tax bill, the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d addressed some initial concerns, uncertainty linked to tariffs persists. The prolonged freight downturn also continues to contribute to decision delays from shippers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Operating revenue went up 2% year over year in Q2.\n*   Q2 operating revenue was $2.6 billion.\n*   Revenue growth primarily reflects contractual revenue growth in Supply Chain Solutions (SCS).\n*   Revenue growth also reflects contractual revenue growth in Fleet Management Solutions (FMS).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ryder System:** Company reporting Q2 earnings, experiencing varied customer decision-making across its segments.\n*   **Robert Sanchez:** Ryder CEO, who noted increased sales on the Supply Chain side but not in other segments.\n*   **Cristina Gallo-Aquino:** Ryder CFO, who stated Q2 revenue growth reflected contractual revenue in SCS and FMS.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** His administration\u2019s tariff policy is cited as a source of customer uncertainty.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Ryder sees a split recovery, with supply chain customers acting, others still hesitant.",

        "summary_text": "When it comes to fleet maintenance, few decisions impact long-term performance and safety more than the quality of the parts used in fifth wheel repairs. Using non-genuine OEM components might save a few dollars today, but it could cost you thousands tomorrow in breakdowns, liability, and lost productivity. While non-genuine OEM parts may seem cost effective in the short term, they can compromise safety, reliability, and long-term fleet ROI.\n\nFor fleet executives and maintenance leaders alike, understanding the value of genuine OEM fifth wheel parts isn\u2019t just about technical specs, it\u2019s about protecting your people, your uptime, and your bottom line.\n\nThe Fifth Wheel \u2013 A Critical Component\n\nThe fifth wheel is the pivotal link between the tractor and trailer that bears massive weight, absorbs dynamic stress during travel, and is vital to safety for all drivers on the road. If the fifth wheel connection was to fail, the consequences extend beyond inconvenience, leading to potential hazards that endanger others, and high costs. Given the critical role of this component, the integrity of every part, from the locking mechanism down to the bushings in the mounting bracket, play a direct role in ensuring optimal performance and minimizing risk.\n\nGenuine OEM vs. Non-Genuine Parts \u2013 Not all parts are created equal.\n\nGenuine OEM parts are designed, tested, and validated by the original manufacturer specifically for their fifth wheel assembly that has been approved and installed by an OEM. These parts meet exact performance standards and are manufactured to handle the wear, load, and environmental challenges of real-world fleet operations.\n\nNon-genuine parts may fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean they perform. They may not have the rigorous testing, material quality, or tolerances of genuine parts. Even a slight variation in materials, finish, or alignment can drastically reduce part life or lead to failure.\n\nThe Risks of Cutting Corners\n\nUsing non-genuine fifth wheel parts expose your fleet to multiple operational and financial risks.\n\nIncreased failure rates: Non-genuine parts often wear prematurely, leading to frequent replacements and unexpected downtime.\n\nPotential safety hazards: Poorly manufactured locking mechanisms can result in trailer disconnects, putting drivers, cargo, and public in harm\u2019s way.\n\nCostly downtime: A failed coupling on the road halts delivery, delays schedules, and can require expensive roadside assistance or towing.\n\nVoided warranties: Many genuine OEM part manufacturers will not honor warranties if non-genuine parts are used, which can lead to significant out-of-pocket repair costs.\n\nThe Long-Term Value of Genuine OEM Parts\n\nWhile the upfront costs of genuine OEM parts may be higher, the total cost of ownership proves their value over time.\n\nMaximized uptime: Genuine OEM parts are engineered for durability, helping keep your trucks on the road longer with fewer unexpected stops.\n\nExtended service intervals: Superior materials and engineering lead to fewer replacements and lower labor costs.\n\nPredictable performance: Consistency across your fleet improves service planning and reduces the risk of roadside events.\n\nRegulatory compliance: Genuine OEM parts are built to meet DOT and industry safety standards, giving your operation a stronger defense in audits or inspections.\n\nHow to Ensure You\u2019re Getting Genuine OEM Parts\n\nProtecting your fleet starts with proactive sourcing. There are multiple ways you can ensure authenticity of the repair parts you\u2019re buying.\n\nBuy from authorized dealers: Use trusted distributors and ask for genuine OEM parts.\n\nInspect packaging and branding: Genuine OEM parts have clear, traceable markings and part numbers.\n\nTrain your team: Educate maintenance and purchasing staff to identify and reject non-genuine or suspicious components.\n\nSmart Fleets Don\u2019t Cut Corners\n\nFor executives managing large, complex fleets, every operational decision has ripple effects. Choosing genuine OEM fifth wheel parts isn\u2019t just a maintenance decision; it\u2019s a leadership one. It signals a commitment to safety, reliability, and cost-efficiency. In a competitive and increasingly regulated industry, the fleets that last are the ones that make smart, long-term decisions.\n\nGenuine OEM parts deliver genuine value. For critical components like fifth wheels, there is no room for compromise. Invest in the genuine OEM parts that keep your fleet safe, productive, and profitable mile after mile.",

This extension follows a Thursday call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Imports from Mexico were slated to incur a 30% tariff starting Friday, following a monthslong pause. However, imports of cars, steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico will still face U.S. sectoral duties.

This may challenge a view expecting broad country-specific tariffs to resume uniformly, as Mexico received a temporary reprieve for USMCA-compliant goods. It signals ongoing negotiation rather than an immediate escalation of trade tensions with Mexico. Conversely, the immediate implementation of new tariffs on India and Brazil shows a selective approach to trade policy. This could challenge views expecting a uniform delay or resolution of trade disputes across all partners, demonstrating varied outcomes.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Trump administration plans to resume country-specific duties starting Friday, following a monthslong pause.

By insulating its cost structure from purchased transportation, XPO is positioning itself for greater benefit when demand recovers and truckload rates potentially increase by 20-40%. This proactive approach, including substantial investments in AI, demonstrates a strategic effort to improve profitability and operational control independently of market conditions. These internal efficiencies could provide a competitive advantage regardless of broader economic shifts.\n\n**The big picture:**\nXPO's Chief Strategy Officer stated that investments in rolling stock have allowed the carrier to cut outsourcing costs in the short term. The company aims to position itself for success once the LTL market improves and demand recovers. XPO can operate linehaul miles more efficiently than third-party contractors, which has contributed to its current wins amidst the market slowdown. The company also highlighted that new AI-powered linehaul models are driving additional savings, further improving efficiency.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 purchased transportation costs: $32 million, down about 53% compared to a year ago.\n*   Outsourced linehaul miles in Q2: 6.8% of total miles.\n*   Outsourced linehaul miles a year ago: 15.9% of total miles.\n*   This represents more than 900 basis points lower than last year.\n*   AI-powered models reduce normalized linehaul miles by 3%, empty miles by over 10%, and freight diversions by more than 80%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **XPO:** Reduced purchased transportation costs for its LTL segment and implemented new AI-powered models.\n*   **Ali Faghri:** XPO's Chief Strategy Officer, stated investments have insulated the company's cost structure.\n*   **Mario Harik:** XPO's CEO, noted the best-ever level for outsourced linehaul miles in the company's history.\n*   **ArcBest:** A transportation player that achieved efficiencies by optimizing city routes using AI.\n*   **C.H. Robinson Worldwide:** A transportation player that offers AI-powered price quotes, speeding output.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   XPO aims to hire a director of AI and plans to launch more AI integrations this year.\n*   The company is currently piloting how AI can improve pickup and delivery operations to lower costs.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nXPO's strategic cost cuts and AI focus aim to boost efficiency and insulate future profitability.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\n3 Big Numbers is a weekly column that looks at a few key details from around the c-store industry.\n\nSeven & i Holdings, the Japanese company that owns 7-Eleven, has been having a rough time lately.\n\nConcerns about the company\u2019s overall performance have led to disgruntled shareholders putting pressure on leaders to either make big changes or consider Alimentation Couche-Tard\u2019s bid to buy it out.\n\nSeven & i has taken some drastic steps this year, including naming its first non-Japanese CEO in Stephen Dacus and planning to take its North American arm, 7-Eleven Inc., public in 2026.\n\nAmid all this, the company has outlined a number of goals, including cutting costs and boosting foodservice, delivery and private label sales.\n\nIn this week\u2019s \u201c3 Big Numbers,\u201d we look at three areas where 7-Eleven has made progress on its long-term plans in North America.\n\n$245 million 7-Eleven\u2019s Q1 operating income.\n\nOperating income for 7-Eleven grew from $201 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to $245 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025, according to Seven & i\u2019s earnings presentation. That\u2019s more than a 20% increase.\n\nChallenges persisted, however, as same-store sales were down 1%. But the growth came largely from increased merchandise gross product margins and a small decrease in non-production costs, such as administrative salaries or rents.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the margin increase for a moment and focus on the cost savings. 7-Eleven targeted $500 million in cost savings last year and managed to surpass that by cutting spending by $562 million during fiscal 2024. The focus on fiscal discipline is continuing into this year, with the company looking to make further cuts ahead of the proposed 2026 IPO.\n\n435 The number of 7-Eleven stores where food and beverage programs were modernized in Q1.\n\n7-Eleven\u2019s foot traffic was down 6% in Q1 year over year, according to the earnings presentation. While that\u2019s never great, 7-Eleven was able to offset this drop in a couple ways.\n\nFirst, its average basket size in the first quarter was up 5.3%. Second, the company boosted its gross product margins by 1.1% in the quarter.\n\nWhile these margin gains came from multiple areas, they were mainly a result of the company\u2019s focus on growing proprietary products. It saw better margins from fresh food and private label goods.\n\nThe company has rolled out modernized food and beverage programs to 435 sites so far in fiscal 2025. While the rollout is expected to slow for the rest of the year, 7-Eleven is expected to modernize the offering in another 1,000 stores. This modernization includes adding hot grab-and-go cases as well as racks of bakery items.\n\nPrivate label plus updated coffee programs and an expansion in the number of stores that include restaurants show that whether or not it works, 7-Eleven is remaining focused on improving its reputation among food-seeking patrons.\n\n18.2% The year-over-year increase in same-store delivery sales for 7-Eleven in Q1.\n\n7-Eleven only added delivery to 74 stores during the quarter, but that\u2019s understandable when delivery is already available in over half of the company\u2019s locations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is the increasing use of delivery at stores that have already had it for a while.\n\nSame-store delivery sales \u2014 that is, sales growth among stores that already had delivery during fiscal Q1 in 2024 \u2014 were up over 18% year over year. The average basket size for these orders was more than $15.\n\nIf 7-Eleven can keep growing these sales, or even just maintaining these basket sizes white the number of stores offering delivery grows, the incremental sales will have an even bigger impact on the bottom line.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** 7-Eleven Shows North American Progress Amid Cost Cuts and Strategy Shifts\n\n**Key details:** 7-Eleven's North American Q1 operating income rose to $245 million, a 20%+ increase, despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. This growth stemmed from increased merchandise gross product margins and cost reductions. The company modernized food and beverage offerings in 435 stores and saw same-store delivery sales jump 18.2% year-over-year. Average delivery basket size exceeded $15. The company also surpassed its fiscal 2024 cost savings target, cutting spending by $562 million.\n\n**Why it matters:** These Q1 results highlight 7-Eleven\u2019s progress in North America despite overall performance concerns and shareholder pressure for drastic changes or a buyout. The growth in operating income, driven by margin gains and cost cuts, suggests internal initiatives are yielding results. Increased delivery sales and modernized food programs aim to improve profitability and customer appeal. This performance could challenge the perception that the company is solely struggling, showing tangible steps towards operational improvement.\n\n**The big picture:** Seven & i Holdings, 7-Eleven's parent company, has faced a challenging period marked by shareholder dissatisfaction. This pressure has prompted major strategic shifts, including appointing Stephen Dacus as CEO and planning a 2026 IPO for 7-Eleven Inc. The company has also outlined goals to cut costs and boost key sales areas. These recent North American results show early progress on those long-term plans.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   $245 million: 7-Eleven\u2019s Q1 operating income.\n*   20%+: Year-over-year increase in 7-Eleven's Q1 operating income.\n*   $562 million: Spending cut by 7-Eleven in fiscal 2024.\n*   435: Number of 7-Eleven stores with modernized food programs in Q1.\n*   18.2%: Year-over-year increase in same-store delivery sales for 7-Eleven in Q1.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Seven & i Holdings:** Japanese company owning 7-Eleven, facing shareholder pressure over overall performance.\n*   **7-Eleven Inc.:** North American arm of 7-Eleven, plans to go public in 2026, showing Q1 progress.\n*   **Alimentation Couche-Tard:** Company that made a bid to buy out Seven & i Holdings.\n*   **Stephen Dacus:** Appointed as Seven & i Holdings' first non-Japanese CEO this year.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Continued focus on cost savings and fiscal discipline into the current year.\n*   Modernization of food and beverage offerings in another 1,000 stores.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** 7-Eleven's North American segment shows early returns from strategic changes.",

        "summary": "**Schneider Implements Early Peak Surcharges Amidst Tariff-Driven Demand Surge**\n\n**Key details:** Schneider National has already placed peak season surcharges for its intermodal business, executing them about six to eight weeks ahead of its normal schedule. The company is initiating similar conversations with its truckload customers. This move aims to manage operations and incremental costs, preventing a few customers from disrupting its network. Schneider's intermodal business saw revenues, excluding fuel surcharge, increase 5% year over year, driven by a 5% volume growth, with evidence of customers \"pulling forwards\" activity into Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:** Schneider's early surcharges signal an unusual peak season driven by customer demand reacting to global trade complexities and developing tariff policies. This information challenges a simple \"demand is up\" consensus, as DAT Freight & Analytics suggests an earlier peak season could present challenges for carriers. While customers are surging up now, frontloading efforts since last September could lead to flat volumes for the rest of the year, potentially impacting carrier profitability beyond the initial surge.\n\n**The big picture:** Shippers are responding to ongoing global trade complexities and evolving tariff policies by frontloading efforts to mitigate potential challenges. This behavior has led to an uptick in demand for some carriers earlier than typical. Both Schneider National and J.B. Hunt Transport Services have reacted by implementing peak season surcharges ahead of schedule. These carriers are trying to manage costs and ensure operational stability in response to this anticipated volatility.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Schneider's intermodal surcharges were executed \"about six to eight weeks ahead\" of when it normally does.\n*   Schneider's intermodal business saw revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increase \"5% year over year.\"\n*   This revenue growth was driven by volume growth of \"5%.\"\n*   Shippers have been bringing imports earlier \"since last September\" at high volumes.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Schneider National:** A carrier that has implemented early peak season surcharges for intermodal and truckload services.\n*   **Jim Filter:** Schneider's EVP and group president of transportation and logistics, who discussed the early surcharges and demand drivers.\n*   **Mark Rourke:** President and CEO of Schneider, who noted difficulty quantifying Q2 \"pull forwards\" but observed evidence.\n*   **J.B. Hunt Transport Services:** Another carrier that also began its peak season surcharges earlier this year.\n*   **DAT Freight & Analytics:** An entity that suggests an earlier peak season could present challenges to carriers.\n*   **Dean Croke:** DAT iQ principal analyst, who stated that the rest of the year is expected to be flat in terms of volumes.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Schneider's early surcharges reflect tariff-driven demand, but future volumes may be flat.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Ryder sees supply chain activity rise while other segments lag.\n\n**Key details:** Ryder System reported an uptick in decision-making among its supply chain customers in Q2. CEO Robert Sanchez noted a pickup in sales for the Supply Chain side but not for the Dedicated and Leasing segments. Customers in these latter segments continue to delay decisions due to ongoing tariff announcements from the Trump administration. This hesitation has carried over from Q1, though the passage of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" clarified some initial uncertainty.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information highlights a divergence in customer behavior within Ryder's various business segments, which could be significant for investors. The increased decision-making in Supply Chain Solutions suggests that some customers are moving past general market uncertainty. However, continued delays in Dedicated and Leasing indicate that the broader freight downturn and tariff uncertainty still hinder long-term commitments in other areas. This challenges a potential consensus view that all segments would be uniformly impacted by current economic conditions.\n\n**The big picture:** Market uncertainty, including a freight recession and U.S. tariff policy, has prolonged decision delays for shippers. Ryder noted customer hesitation on signing long-term contracts since Q1, particularly for cross-border shippers. While President Donald Trump\u2019s tax bill, the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d addressed some initial concerns, uncertainty linked to tariffs persists.

        "summary_text": "When it comes to fleet maintenance, few decisions impact long-term performance and safety more than the quality of the parts used in fifth wheel repairs. Using non-genuine OEM components might save a few dollars today, but it could cost you thousands tomorrow in breakdowns, liability, and lost productivity. While non-genuine OEM parts may seem cost effective in the short term, they can compromise safety, reliability, and long-term fleet ROI.\n\nFor fleet executives and maintenance leaders alike, understanding the value of genuine OEM fifth wheel parts isn\u2019t just about technical specs, it\u2019s about protecting your people, your uptime, and your bottom line.\n\nThe Fifth Wheel \u2013 A Critical Component\n\nThe fifth wheel is the pivotal link between the tractor and trailer that bears massive weight, absorbs dynamic stress during travel, and is vital to safety for all drivers on the road. If the fifth wheel connection was to fail, the consequences extend beyond inconvenience, leading to potential hazards that endanger others, and high costs. Given the critical role of this component, the integrity of every part, from the locking mechanism down to the bushings in the mounting bracket, play a direct role in ensuring optimal performance and minimizing risk.\n\nGenuine OEM vs. Non-Genuine Parts \u2013 Not all parts are created equal.\n\nGenuine OEM parts are designed, tested, and validated by the original manufacturer specifically for their fifth wheel assembly that has been approved and installed by an OEM. These parts meet exact performance standards and are manufactured to handle the wear, load, and environmental challenges of real-world fleet operations.\n\nNon-genuine parts may fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean they perform. They may not have the rigorous testing, material quality, or tolerances of genuine parts. Even a slight variation in materials, finish, or alignment can drastically reduce part life or lead to failure.\n\nThe Risks of Cutting Corners\n\nUsing non-genuine fifth wheel parts expose your fleet to multiple operational and financial risks.\n\nIncreased failure rates: Non-genuine parts often wear prematurely, leading to frequent replacements and unexpected downtime.\n\nPotential safety hazards: Poorly manufactured locking mechanisms can result in trailer disconnects, putting drivers, cargo, and public in harm\u2019s way.\n\nCostly downtime: A failed coupling on the road halts delivery, delays schedules, and can require expensive roadside assistance or towing.\n\nVoided warranties: Many genuine OEM part manufacturers will not honor warranties if non-genuine parts are used, which can lead to significant out-of-pocket repair costs.\n\nThe Long-Term Value of Genuine OEM Parts\n\nWhile the upfront costs of genuine OEM parts may be higher, the total cost of ownership proves their value over time.\n\nMaximized uptime: Genuine OEM parts are engineered for durability, helping keep your trucks on the road longer with fewer unexpected stops.\n\nExtended service intervals: Superior materials and engineering lead to fewer replacements and lower labor costs.\n\nPredictable performance: Consistency across your fleet improves service planning and reduces the risk of roadside events.\n\nRegulatory compliance: Genuine OEM parts are built to meet DOT and industry safety standards, giving your operation a stronger defense in audits or inspections.\n\nHow to Ensure You\u2019re Getting Genuine OEM Parts\n\nProtecting your fleet starts with proactive sourcing. There are multiple ways you can ensure authenticity of the repair parts you\u2019re buying.\n\nBuy from authorized dealers: Use trusted distributors and ask for genuine OEM parts.\n\nInspect packaging and branding: Genuine OEM parts have clear, traceable markings and part numbers.\n\nTrain your team: Educate maintenance and purchasing staff to identify and reject non-genuine or suspicious components.\n\nSmart Fleets Don\u2019t Cut Corners\n\nFor executives managing large, complex fleets, every operational decision has ripple effects. Choosing genuine OEM fifth wheel parts isn\u2019t just a maintenance decision; it\u2019s a leadership one. It signals a commitment to safety, reliability, and cost-efficiency. In a competitive and increasingly regulated industry, the fleets that last are the ones that make smart, long-term decisions.\n\nGenuine OEM parts deliver genuine value. For critical components like fifth wheels, there is no room for compromise. Invest in the genuine OEM parts that keep your fleet safe, productive, and profitable mile after mile.",

However, revenue increased 2.4% sequentially compared to Q1. Its operating ratio rose to 74.6% in Q2, up from 71.9% a year ago. Other LTL peers like ArcBest and TFI International also reported similar sequential revenue upticks in Q2. ArcBest's revenue was up 5.7% sequentially to $1 billion.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe sequential revenue improvement, despite seasonal trends, is helpful amid a three-year downcycle for the industry. Old Dominion is managing costs and protecting service in a very weak environment. Its operating ratio worsened as volumes decreased due to the company's commitment to superior service. This challenges a consensus of pure decline, suggesting a potential sequential stabilization for LTL revenue. However, the rising operating ratio indicates efficiency challenges persist in a low-volume market.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) industry is contending with volumes approximately 15% lower than during the demand surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reflects a broader three-year downcycle for the sector. Companies are maintaining a disciplined pricing strategy, refusing to chase \"bad revenue.\" This approach continues even as many shippers are intensely focused on achieving cost savings.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Old Dominion Q2 Revenue:** $1.41 billion\n*   **Old Dominion YoY Revenue Decline:** Roughly 6%\n*   **Old Dominion Q2 Operating Ratio:** 74.6% (vs. 71.9% a year ago)\n*   **LTL Industry Volume Decline:** 15% lower than pandemic surge\n*   **ArcBest Q2 Sequential Revenue Increase:** 5.7% (to $1 billion)\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Old Dominion Freight Line:** Reported Q2 revenue decline year-over-year but a sequential increase.\n*   **Adam Satterfield:** Old Dominion EVP and CFO, noted revenue improvement helps in a downcycle.\n*   **Kevin \u201cMarty\u201d Freeman:** Old Dominion President and CEO, expressed confidence in improving long-term operating ratio.\n*   **ArcBest:** LTL peer experiencing a similar sequential revenue uptick, with a 5.7% increase.\n*   **TFI International:** LTL peer whose LTL segment saw a 3.6% sequential revenue increase.\n*   **Matt Beasley:** ArcBest CFO, highlighted securing 4% average deferred price increases.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nOld Dominion's sequential revenue growth signals a potential bottom in a weak freight market.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nTwelve states and the District of Columbia have launched rebate programs funded by the Inflation Reduction Act to help homeowners and low-to-moderate income households increase their energy efficiency.\n\nThe Home Owner Managing Energy Savings Act, or HOMES, and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates, or HEAR, were allocated $8.8 billion under the IRA that is set to be disbursed, while a similar residential energy efficiency tax credit was ended early by the Republican tax and spending law.\n\nDavid Terry, president of the National Association of State Energy Officials, said the association has been \u201crepeatedly\u201d assured by the U.S. Department of Energy that all obligated funds for the rebate program \u201cwill ultimately get out the door.\u201d All states except South Dakota applied for the funding and have received conditional awards.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nA DOE spokesperson said in an email that the department \u201cis continuing to conduct a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nTerry said he is \u201coptimistic at this point\u201d that the administration is working to streamline the program and will then resume negotiations with the remaining states within a framework \u201cthat would allow the programs to operate a little bit more cheaply and a little bit more quickly.\u201d\n\nThe IRA sets the HOMES and HEAR programs to run either until their funding runs out, or Sept. 30, 2031.\n\nHOMES set aside $4.3 billion in rebates for \u201cwhole-home retrofit packages based on the reduction in home energy use,\u201d such as \u201cbuilding envelope upgrades, appliance and HVAC equipment replacement, and installation tasks,\u201d according to the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.\n\nHEAR set aside $4.5 billion \u201cto fund efficient electrification of low- and moderate-income households\u201d with alterations like \u201cappliance upgrades, installation costs, and enabling measures such as upgrading circuit panels, insulation, air sealing, ventilation, and wiring,\u201d NEEP said. Those appliances include heat pumps and heat pump water heaters.\n\n\u201cWhile many federal energy programs and tax credits have been impacted by recent federal policy changes, this program, which is administered through state energy offices, has remained in development but has run into some roadblocks,\u201d NEEP said.\n\nThe Trump administration has been working to claw back funding for other IRA programs, including the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar For All grants. In July, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ending the 25D residential clean energy tax credit and the 25C energy efficient home improvement credit after this year.\n\nStates are individually responsible for creating the rebate programs to disburse this funding. According to NASEO, 12 states plus D.C. have launched one or both programs, though six \u2014 North Carolina, Wisconsin, New York, California, Maine and Colorado \u2014 are in a pilot phase.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons a lot of them did pilot phases initially was to work out any kinks, things that might have been unique to a particular part of the state they were working in, or a particular client,\u201d Terry said. He cited Maine, where state officials wanted to offer upgrades for older manufactured housing, and had to find equipment that would \u201cphysically fit and work properly in those homes.\u201d\n\nTerry said he sees potential for the program to have nationwide energy efficiency benefits such as providing \u201cgood guidance on the bang-for-your-buck of different measures in different types of housing and in different locations,\u201d and by bolstering experience among contractors.\n\nD.C., Georgia, Arizona, Indiana, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Michigan have programs fully up and running. Only Michigan, Wisconsin, D.C., Georgia, Indiana and North Carolina have established both HOMES and HEAR programs \u2014 the other states have only launched HEAR.\n\n\u201cGeorgia is very active \u2014 they're having great success with their rebate program,\u201d Terry said. \u201cIndiana had their program negotiated and approved just before the new administration took office, and launched [in May], and that seems to be going well. And certainly the other states, they're going through the funds pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nTerry said there are variations from state to state \u201cin terms of the particular market they're trying to target,\u201d but \u201cthey're largely all trying to target affordable, moderate and lower income households where the benefit belongs. I think that's going well.\u201d\n\nNASEO has issued a recommendation for the requirements associated with these programs to be streamlined, and Terry said that one of the reasons so few agreements were negotiated under the Biden administration is that DOE at the time \u201cput an extraordinary number of requirements on these programs that were not in statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made them very complicated to negotiate, and complicated to implement,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we, early on in the Trump administration, flagged that streamlining the requirements would be very helpful in terms of bringing down administrative costs. And if you bring down administrative costs, that frees up more money for the rebates.\u201d\n\nThere are several states that are waiting for negotiations with DOE to resume but \u201chave one or both of their programs essentially fully prepared \u2026 and just need some quick updates and finalization with [DOE], and they'll be ready to launch,\u201d Terry said. \u201cAnd some of those are relatively large population states. So nationally, [their launch] will certainly have an impact.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "Aftab Khan is executive vice president of operations, planning and security at the PJM Interconnection.\n\nFor most of its nearly 100-year history, the PJM Interconnection has operated behind the scenes. When the job is to ensure reliable electricity for 67 million people, being largely invisible is often a sign that the system is working as it should. More recently, PJM has been thrust into a more public light. In many instances, that has been a good thing. Consumers deserve an open and honest conversation about the conditions facing the industry today.\n\nSince early 2023, PJM has been warning of the potential for an electricity supply and demand imbalance \u2014 one we are now seeing play out \u2014 and the effect that could have on future grid reliability.\n\nAt the same time, some public narratives have presented an incomplete or inaccurate picture of PJM\u2019s role in overseeing the operations, markets and planning functions of the grid. It is important to set the record straight by focusing on the facts.\n\nPJM is the regional grid operator for 13 states and Washington, D.C. Our core mission is to keep the lights on in our region. We act like an air traffic controller, maneuvering electricity through outages and storms across a multistate grid to match supply and demand in real time. We make sure that your local utility has the power it needs to deliver it to your homes and businesses.\n\nPJM also does not operate for profit. We have no profit motive, no shareholders and no share price. We are fully regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and cannot make any major changes to how we operate unless we have that body\u2019s approval. Our only motivation is to use our engineering expertise to keep the lights on and provide value to consumers.\n\nUnderstandably, rising electricity bills have become a top concern. These increases deserve thoughtful explanation and honest context. A typical consumer electric bill consists of three primary components. One involves the delivery of power to your home or business from your local utility. The next includes the taxes or surcharges authorized by your utility and its state regulator. The charges for both of these components are governed by the utility and the specific state and do not involve PJM.\n\nThe third component reflects the cost of generating and transmitting power. That is where PJM plays a role. To ensure reliability, we forecast electricity needs and run competitive auctions to secure the supply required to meet demand. These costs have risen recently because supply is decreasing while demand is growing.\n\nSeveral factors are behind this shift. Power plants that generate electricity are retiring, often due to decarbonization policies or economic pressures. Simultaneously, demand is increasing due to the growth of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. When fewer resources are available and more are needed, prices naturally rise.\n\nThis dynamic is national, but some states in the PJM region are feeling the effects more acutely. In areas where older resources are being retired without enough new supply coming online, prices are under even more pressure.\n\nPJM is working with stakeholders across the region to plan for these changes and support the development of new, reliable sources of power. In 2022, PJM reformed its interconnection process to better manage the high volume of renewable power projects seeking to connect to our system. That reform, approved by federal regulators, is already helping to move projects through the system more efficiently.\n\nAs of June, more than 46 GW of new generation, most of it renewable, had received interconnection approval, meaning those projects are clear to be built from PJM\u2019s standpoint. This is enough energy to power roughly 40 million homes at full output. Many of these projects now face challenges related to construction, financing, permitting and supply chains, which are outside of PJM\u2019s control. Still, we are tracking these issues closely and continuing to support progress where we can.\n\nThe power grid is a complex machine governed by the principles of engineering, mathematics and economics. Any effort to improve it must begin with a clear understanding of those realities. Policy decisions are important, but they must be grounded in the fundamentals of how the system works.\n\nPJM remains committed to transparency, collaboration and delivering solutions. We will continue to work to ensure a reliable and affordable energy future, keep the lights on, and do it cost-effectively for families and businesses.",

This dynamic, characterized by decreasing supply and increasing demand, is driving recent rises in electricity bills.

The termination letters could be sent by the end of this week,\u201d Foley Hoag said. \u201cThis recent news represents a considerable escalation on EPA\u2019s part. EPA\u2019s termination efforts are likely to invite strong legal challenges\u201d and may stand on the same legal ground as challenges from recipients of frozen Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funding, the firm said.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality says in an undated alert on its website, \u201cSection 60002 of the OBBBA repealed the section of the Clean Air Act that created the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescinded \u2018unobligated balances\u2019 under the Fund.

Termination letters from the EPA could be sent by the end of this week, though the purported basis for termination is not yet known.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe potential termination is \"deeply alarming\" to groups like Vote Solar, as it could cancel \"contractually obligated funding\" for \"shovel-ready\" solar projects. This action is described as part of a larger administration effort to claw back appropriated clean energy funds. Law firm Foley Hoag anticipates \"strong legal challenges\" against these efforts, potentially mirroring past funding disputes. The move challenges the stability of clean energy funding, as some recipients, like North Carolina's EnergizeNC, maintain their award agreements are still in effect. Programs already launched, such as Georgia BRIGHT, which quickly saw high sign-ups, could face uncertainty.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Solar For All fund originates from the Inflation Reduction Act, intended to boost solar growth and deployment with benefits to low-income communities. This potential termination is linked to the Trump administration's use of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" (OBBBA). The OBBBA is described as a tool for reversing Biden administration energy transition policies by eliminating or curtailing clean energy funding. The attempt to cancel Solar For All is part of a \"larger series of efforts\" to claw back funds appropriated by Congress under various acts.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$7 billion:** The total value of the Solar For All fund.\n*   **60:** The number of grantees that have received funding.\n*   **49:** The number of states with nonprofits affected by the potential termination.\n*   **$156.1 million:** The grant amount received by EnergizeNC from Solar For All.\n*   **500:** Approximately the number of households that signed up for Georgia BRIGHT within 24 hours.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Weighing terminating the $7 billion Solar For All fund.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** His administration's actions are seeking to reverse Biden's energy policies.\n*   **Sach Constantine:** Executive Director at Vote Solar, calls EPA's move deeply alarming.\n*   **Vote Solar:** Nonprofit expressing alarm over potential cancellation of Solar For All grants.\n*   **Foley Hoag:** Law firm stating EPA's termination efforts are escalation, likely inviting legal challenges.\n*   **North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ):** Received Solar for All funds, maintains award agreement is still in effect.\n*   **EnergizeNC:** Awarded $156.1 million Solar for All grant, moving forward with program planning.\n*   **Kym Meyer:** Litigation director at Southern Environmental Law Center, vows to sue if funding is stripped.\n*   **Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC):** Noted Georgia BRIGHT program launch, threatens legal action.\n*   **The Capital Good Fund:** Georgia nonprofit awarded $156 million grant, created Georgia BRIGHT program.\n*   **Georgia BRIGHT:** No-cost solar program for low-income households, created with Solar For All funding.\n*   **Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources:** State department mentioned as a Solar For All funding recipient.\n*   **Bonneville Environmental Foundation:** Nonprofit mentioned as a Solar For All funding recipient.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The EPA's termination letters for Solar For All grants could be sent by the end of this week.\n*   Strong legal challenges against these termination efforts are likely.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFederal clean energy funding faces termination, sparking legal battles and project uncertainty.",

Energy storage companies saw funding drop 41% over the same time period, according to Mercom.\n\nAlthough total funding declined, project acquisitions and merger activity picked up, likely driven by decreased valuations, according to Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom, which collects data on financing deals announced around the globe, excluding data on Chinese companies.\n\nDespite an early phase-out of renewable energy tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, having the final details in hand could be enough to prompt more investor activity in the second half of 2025, Prabhu said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nInvestors dislike uncertainty, so it should be no surprise that financing for solar and storage companies took a dive in the first half of the year, according to Prabhu. But the consulting firm's data also points to a handful of bright spots.\n\nSolar public market financing dropped 73% from $1.7 billion in the first half of 2024 to $467 million in the first half of 2025, according to Mercom. The total value of venture capital and private equity funding also fell about 50% year over year, but the number of individual deals grew from 29 to 32.\n\nIt's not entirely clear, Prabhu said, what may have prompted investors to pursue more, but smaller, deals in the solar sector.\n\nIf investors were locking in good deals during the downturn, they weren\u2019t alone. Nearly 20 GW of existing solar assets changed hands in the first half of 2025, compared to 18.5 GW over the same time period in 2024. Mergers and solar company acquisitions also rose, led by investment firms and utilities.\n\n\u201cWhen the market has so much volatility and uncertainty, there are always deals to be made, assets to be picked off,\u201d Prabhu said. \u201cSo if investors see a good deal \u2014 an undervalued asset, an undervalued company \u2014 because of the uncertainty ... they are going to do those deals and acquire that company.\u201d\n\nStorage took an even bigger hit than solar, with venture capital and private equity falling 29% across fewer deals, public market funding down 43%, and just three mergers and company acquisitions, down from 14 in the first half of 2024.\n\nHowever, acquisitions of energy storage projects more than doubled, and venture capitalists are showing an interest in alternative storage technologies like sodium-based batteries, according to Mercom.\n\nInvestment trends should begin to stabilize and possibly recover toward the end of this year now that Congress has completed the reconciliation process, Prabhu said. While the outcome may not have been favorable for renewable energy companies, knowing what the policy landscape looks like going forward should help investors identify the companies that are best positioned to pivot.\n\nAnd there is some evidence from the quarterly data that the solar sector is already adapting, Prabhu said. Debt financing ticked upward slightly in the second quarter of 2025, suggesting that some of the development plans solar companies put on hold in early 2025 have already begun to move forward.\n\n\u201cThe demand is there from data centers and AI ... but the rules of the game itself have changed in the last couple of quarters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players who understand this early will get ahead and define the next chapter of the U.S. and global solar industry going forward.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Solar, Storage Funding Drops Sharply; M&A Rises Amid Uncertainty**\n\n**Key details:**\nTotal corporate funding for solar companies declined 39% and for energy storage companies fell 41% year-over-year in the first half of 2025. Despite this funding drop, project acquisitions and merger activity picked up, likely driven by decreased valuations. Solar public market financing plummeted 73%, and venture capital/private equity funding dropped about 50%, though the number of individual solar deals grew. Storage funding also saw steep declines, but acquisitions of energy storage projects more than doubled. Debt financing for the solar sector showed a slight increase in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe significant decline in funding for solar and energy storage companies signals investor aversion to policy uncertainty following an early phase-out of renewable energy tax credits. This information challenges a simple \"market collapse\" narrative by highlighting that merger and acquisition activity actually increased, driven by investors seeking undervalued assets during the downturn. While overall funding dropped, the increase in individual solar deals and energy storage project acquisitions suggests a shift in investment strategy rather than a complete retreat from the sectors. The slight upward tick in solar debt financing in Q2 2025 also indicates that some previously delayed development plans are beginning to move forward. Knowing the final policy details is expected to prompt more investor activity in the second half of 2025.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe current investment landscape for solar and energy storage is characterized by investor caution due to policy shifts and uncertainty. An early phase-out of renewable energy tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act contributed significantly to this instability. Despite the negative policy outcome for renewables, the completion of Congress's reconciliation process is expected to provide clarity, enabling investors to identify well-positioned companies. The market's \"rules of the game\" have changed, requiring players to adapt to new conditions to succeed. Underlying demand from sectors like data centers and AI remains present for energy solutions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Total corporate funding for solar companies fell 39% year-over-year in H1 2025.\n*   Energy storage companies' funding dropped 41% over the same period.\n*   Solar public market financing plummeted 73%, from $1.7 billion in H1 2024 to $467 million in H1 2025.\n*   Nearly 20 GW of existing solar assets changed hands in H1 2025, up from 18.5 GW in H1 2024.\n*   Acquisitions of energy storage projects more than doubled in H1 2025.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Mercom Capital Group**: Provides data on global financing deals for solar and energy storage companies.\n*   **Raj Prabhu**: CEO of Mercom, offers insights on investment trends and market dynamics for renewables.\n*   **Congress**: Completed reconciliation process, offering policy clarity that could stabilize investment trends.\n*   **Investment firms**: Led the increase in mergers and solar company acquisitions in first half 2025.\n*   **Utilities**: Actively led increases in mergers and solar company acquisitions during the market downturn.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for stabilization and potential recovery of investment trends toward the end of 2025.\n*   Anticipate increased investor activity in the solar and storage sectors in the second half of 2025.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nSolar/storage funding dives, but M&A signals strategic opportunity amid uncertainty.",

The company is in discussions to supply data centers from its 3,758-MW nuclear fleet in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to Dan Cregg, PSEG executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nPJM\u2019s capacity market, which recently set another price record, is flawed and not attracting new power supplies, according to LaRossa. \u201cIf there isn't a change, and there isn't some more control taken by the state of New Jersey, we will be living with the outcome of that [capacity auction] process,\u201d LaRossa said. \u201cThe facts are that there has not been any new baseload generation built in New Jersey for quite some time.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPSE&G\u2019s potential new load comes amid a recent tightening in the power supply-demand balance across the PJM Interconnection, which includes New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe resource adequacy challenges in New Jersey and across the entire 13-state PJM region are becoming more acute as we see both growing demand and new supply slow to respond,\u201d LaRossa said. \u201cWithin the confines of PJM, it's hard to see the path to new generation through existing market signals, which may require the consideration of a new approach to procuring capacity and resource planning.\u201d\n\nReflecting that dynamic, PJM\u2019s capacity auction last month hit a record high. While PSE&G\u2019s customers will be hit by rate increases from the previous auction, they should be unaffected by the most recent auction because of the way New Jersey procures electricity for people who buy default power from their utility instead of purchasing it from competitive suppliers, according to LaRossa.\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers and utility regulators are exploring options for ensuring the state has adequate power supplies, LaRossa said. One pending bill in the New Jersey Legislature \u2014 A.B. 5439 \u2014 could enable regulated utilities like PSE&G to own in-state generation, LaRossa said, noting PSEG has no interest in owning merchant generation.\n\nPolicymakers are grappling with four related issues, according to LaRossa. They are: demand forecasting; grid reliability; affordability; and environmental policy goals, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you put those four pieces together, we think we'll be able to find the right answer and solution for the state,\u201d LaRossa said. \u201cWe'll be willing to help out in that in whatever way the state is looking for us to play a role.\u201d\n\nLaRossa decried PJM\u2019s governance structure in response to a question about governors from PJM\u2019s footprint seeking a role in selecting the grid operator\u2019s board members, a request that will hinge on a vote by the PJM\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cHow crazy does it sound that the governors have to get a Members Committee vote to allow a vote to take place to have a seat at the table?\u201d LaRossa asked. \u201cThis governance process is the core problem.\u201d\n\nIf the vote doesn\u2019t go their way, the region\u2019s governors could ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to intervene, according to LaRossa.\n\nOn the financial front, PSEG\u2019s second-quarter income jumped to $585 million, or $1.17/share, up from $434 million, or 87 cents/share, in the year-ago period, partly on higher electric rates, according to the company\u2019s quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. PSEG\u2019s revenue increased to $2.8 billion in the second quarter from $2.4 billion in the same period last year.\n\nWeather-normalized electric sales increased 1% in the trailing 12 months ending June 30, down from a 2% increase in the 12-month period from the end of the first quarter, according to PSEG.

Current preventive practices are based on the deployment of crewed helicopters, either equipped with RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors, or they simply rely on the human eye to spot anomalies, from equipment changes to encroaching vegetation threats. With all of this effort already behind inspections, it\u2019s easy to wonder how they can be improved to better protect against future catastrophic failures of critical infrastructure. The answer is unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nUAVs have a few very important differences compared with the crewed helicopters that conduct energy infrastructure inspections today. Their widespread use depends on the passing of a critical Federal Aviation Administration rule that\u2019s long been in the works. Thanks to a new executive order, however, it may be here sooner than expected.\n\nDrone data versus helicopter data\n\nThe large UAVs, also called drones, designed to carry heavy sensor payloads and conduct critical infrastructure inspections may look like helicopters from the outside, but the way they fly sets them entirely apart.\n\nUnlike manned helicopters, UAVs can be automated to fly identical flight patterns repeatedly \u2014 not just following the same powerline, but maintaining the exact same position in space \u2014 which has significant implications for the data captured.\n\nBy retrieving vast quantities of data from the exact same vantage points repeatedly, the evaluation of these data sets can be automated. Companies can use AI to identify changes and to create highly accurate digital twins that reveal information invisible to the human eye \u2014 such as early indications of erosion based on just a few inches of terrain movement, for example. These micro-changes can often be the earliest warning signs of forthcoming equipment failures, and they can alert maintenance crews to attend to the highest priority fixes.\n\nUAVs can also remove the crew risk, significantly reduce fuel burn, and are more cost-efficient than manned helicopters \u2014 so why aren\u2019t they the new standard for inspections across the industry?\n\nPart 108 and the new executive order\n\nPart 108 is the FAA\u2019s forthcoming regulation for beyond visual line of sight commercial drone operations. In other words, it\u2019s the FAA\u2019s answer to standardizing when drones can fly outside of an operator\u2019s visual range for use cases like critical infrastructure inspection or drone deliveries.\n\nThis regulation has been anticipated for several years, but the agency has been up against changing administrations and complex dependencies, all while developing a set of rules that needs to be right from the start.\n\nA new executive order President Donald Trump issued June 6 will accelerate the timeline for Part 108\u2019s approval. The \u201cUnleashing American Drone Dominance\u201d order requires:\n\nA BVLOS rule proposal within 30 days of the order release date and a final rule within 240 days.\n\nThe establishment of clear metrics for assessing the performance and safety of BVLOS operations within 30 days.\n\nThe identification of and proposed recommendations related to any associated BVLOS barriers within 180 days.\n\nThe use of AI tools to assist in and expedite the review of UAS waiver applications.\n\nAnd the immediate exploration of options to ensure that UAS flights in the U.S. can operate without being subject to onerous requirements of manned aircraft engaging in international navigation.\n\nThis powerful new instruction means the energy industry will likely have widespread BVLOS allowances much sooner than previously expected. It also means the time is now for utilities and infrastructure management companies to evaluate what integrating UAVs into their inspection capabilities will look like.\n\nThe next generation of infrastructure inspections will be here before we know it, and it\u2019ll be safer than ever before.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** New Executive Order Accelerates Drone Use for Critical Infrastructure Inspections\n\n**Key details:** A new executive order significantly accelerates the timeline for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) long-awaited Part 108 rule. This regulation will standardize beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) commercial drone operations for uses like critical infrastructure inspection. The order mandates a BVLOS rule proposal within 30 days and a final rule within 240 days. It also requires establishing performance metrics, identifying associated barriers, and using AI to expedite UAS waiver reviews.\n\n**Why it matters:** This new executive order means the energy industry will likely have widespread beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone allowances much sooner than previously expected. It challenges the current consensus that relies on crewed helicopters for critical infrastructure inspections. Drones offer advantages like automated, repeatable flight patterns for precise data collection and AI-driven analysis for early erosion detection. UAVs also remove crew risk, reduce fuel burn, and are more cost-efficient than manned helicopters, potentially replacing current inspection methods.\n\n**The big picture:** The context for this development is the enduring threat of equipment failures across the aging energy grid, as exemplified by the 2018 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. wildfire that killed 85 and caused $16 billion in damage. Current preventive practices involve crewed helicopters with human inspectors or basic sensors, which struggle to catch early warning signs across thousands of miles. This method is costly, involves crew risk, and cannot provide the precise, repeatable data needed for early detection of micro-changes.

        "summary_text": "This is the latest installment in Waste Dive\u2019s Biogas Monthly series.\n\nEnvironmental groups are opening up new forms of opposition to clean fuels credits that reward farm biogas in two states. If successful, they could reduce the strong incentive farm owners receive to convert biogas from manure into renewable natural gas.\n\nIn California, a coalition of environmental groups led by Food & Water Watch sued the California Air Resources Board on July 25. They allege that the Low Carbon Fuel Standard amendments that went into effect on July 1 unlawfully expand support for farm biogas and lock in negative impacts to communities near factory farms. The groups specifically hope to reverse avoided methane crediting, a policy that gives factory farm biogas particularly strong carbon intensity scores that boosts the price they charge for the credits they generate.\n\n\u201cThis new suit aims to bring CARB back in line with its obligations to honestly and equitably address the climate crisis under California\u2019s climate laws,\u201d Tyler Lobdell, staff attorney at Food & Water Watch, said in a statement. \u201cCARB doubling down on false climate solutions like factory farm biogas is bad for the climate and bad for Californians, and now we\u2019re arguing it\u2019s illegal as well.\u201d\n\nFood & Water Watch is joined by Central Valley Defenders of Clean Air and Water, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Center for Food Safety in its lawsuit. The California Air Resources Board did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.\n\nClean fuel standards have become subject to increasing political pressure in recent months as state and federal lawmakers \u2014 encouraged by the Trump administration \u2014 have prioritized gas prices for consumers over aggressive climate action.\n\nIn a related update, the LCFS appears to have survived an attempt to cap credit prices at January 2025 levels. That proposed change was included as part of SB 237, a bill introduced in the California legislature to make gasoline more affordable. The language was removed from the bill, which is still making its way through the legislature, in July.\n\nFood & Water Watch is also pressuring New Mexico regulators to not include avoided methane crediting in the state\u2019s own that state\u2019s clean fuels policy. New Mexico\u2019s Clean Transportation Fuel Standards are still being shaped by the state\u2019s Environmental Improvement Board. The CTFS program was created through a bill signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in March 2024.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s agency staff have released multiple draft proposals for the fuel standards, with the more recent proposal making carbon intensity scores for factory farm biogas less lucrative, Lobdell said on a recent webinar.\n\nThe environmental group is urging New Mexico residents to keep up pressure on the Environmental Improvement Board ahead of its late September meeting where it will next debate the fuel standards. The board could finalize the standards at that time.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to enrich and entrench factory farms,\u201d Emily Tucker, New Mexico organizer with Food & Water Watch, said on the webinar. \u201cWe must not import this policy from California into New Mexico, especially when that policy has led to numerous legal challenges and is opposed by environmental justice advocates across California.\u201d\n\nDespite activist pushback, new biogas projects and deals progressed in July. Below are a selection of updates from the industry.\n\nCredit pricing as of July 31, 2025 D3 RIN prices: $2.185 Up from $2.175 in 2024 D5 RIN prices: $1.185 Up from $1.105 in 2024 $110.00 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in Oregon\u2019s Clean Fuels Program $59.19 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Source: EcoEngineers Carbon Market Snapshot\n\nRepublic Services brings sixth facility online\n\nAmeresco partnered with Republic Services to open a landfill-gas-to-RNG facility in Dixon, Illinois, the companies announced in July. It's Republic's sixth such facility to open in 2025, with one more scheduled to come online by the end of the year, CEO Jon Vander Ark said on the company's earnings call last week.\n\nLocated at the Lee County Landfill, this is the 15th facility produced by the two partners. They expect it to produce 1.2 million mmBtus of RNG annually.\n\nRepublic continues to progress on its RNG production goals, part of its broader emissions reduction activities. The company said it beneficially reused 76.9 billion standard cubic feet of landfill gas in 2024, per its most recent sustainability report.\n\nSagepoint Energy adds landfill facility\n\nSagepoint Energy reached a deal with North American Power Systems to acquire a landfill-gas-to-electricity facility in Birch Run, Michigan. Sagepoint will convert the Peoples LFG plant to an RNG-producing facility.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of Peoples is a strategic advancement in expanding and strengthening our RNG portfolio,\u201d Sagepoint CEO Aaron Johnson said in a release. \u201cBy converting this landfill gas-to-electricity plant into an RNG facility, we are enhancing our operational capabilities and driving increased renewable natural gas production.\u201d\n\nSagepoint plans to begin construction in 2025 and start commercial operation next year.\n\nThis is the third acquisition by Sagepoint in 2025. The Indiana-based company was formed by Ares Management in April. Sagepoint is working to increase its portfolio of landfill gas projects through M&A this year, Johnson told Waste Dive.\n\nWaga Energy refinances Canadian facilities\n\nFrench RNG company Waga Energy closed a $25 million (Canadian) loan to refinance three Quebec facilities, the company announced. This is the company's first refinancing transaction in Canada.\n\nEquitable and the Empire Life Insurance Co. provided the 19-year loan. The company will pay down construction debt with some of the proceeds. It says the loan will strengthen Waga's cash position and allow it to pursue new facilities in Canada and internationally.\n\nWaga has been expanding rapidly in North America in recent years, with seven plants in operation and 13 under construction. The company continues to negotiate with EQT Transition Infrastructure, which offered to acquire a majority stake in Waga in June. Waga's board of directors previously expressed unanimous support for the deal. If they agree to proceed, the parties would file the offer with French regulators by year\u2019s end.\n\nBTS Bioenergy expands Maryland footprint\n\nBTS Bioenergy, which runs the Maryland Bioenergy Center, opened a new satellite facility to assist with feedstock consolidation. The new Maryland Organics Recovery Center takes palletized food waste from distribution partners and separates organics for processing at the MBC.\n\nBTS Bioenergy, formerly known as Bioenergy Devco, is in the process of improving operations in Maryland, where it's operated an anaerobic digestion facility since 2021. CEO Nick Thomas told Waste Dive in June that he was looking to refocus the company's mission this year and double down on revenue-generating facilities like MBC.\n\n\u201cMORC represents a strategic expansion of our infrastructure that enables BTS Bioenergy to better serve the food distribution sector while advancing our mission of landfill diversion,\u201d Thomas said in a statement announcing the Maryland expansion.",

        "summary_text": "A year ago, capacity prices spiked in the PJM Interconnection. Last month they hit another record high of nearly $330/MW-day.\n\nCompanies including Exelon, FirstEnergy and PPL Corp., which have utilities in states that bar them from owning generation, have been pressing for state legislation that would lift that restriction. They contend that the jump in PJM capacity prices is increasing customer bills but failing to spur independent power producers to build power plants.\n\nTo get a nonutility perspective, on Monday Utility Dive talked with Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for independent power producers, about how power providers are moving to bring electricity supplies to PJM, what\u2019s behind rising electric bills and the challenges all companies face in building power plants.\n\nEPSA members own and operate about 175,000 MW of capacity in U.S. regions with access to competitive wholesale electricity markets. Members include Invenergy, LS Power, NRG Energy, Talen Energy, Tenaska and Vistra.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nUTILITY DIVE: Have we seen a response by IPPs to increased capacity prices in PJM?\n\nTODD SNITCHLER: I think you are seeing a response from the IPP or competitive generator sector in response to price signals, but not exclusively that.\n\nYou saw a significant response to the Reliability Resource Initiative process at PJM, which tried to accelerate projects to the front of the line that were ready to go or could be constructed and operational by 2030. Ninety-four projects were submitted and 51 selected. It was close to 10,000 MW that is supposed to come online by 2030.\n\nAnd that was just a part of how independent producers tried to respond, before the second price signal was even sent in the July auction, which I think we would all agree continued to send the signal for new investment.\n\nOne of the challenges that we're seeing is this compressed auction schedule. There hasn\u2019t been an auction that's been on time in several years now. So you've got these six-month increments, which really make it difficult for generators or investors to make a decision that says, \u201cOkay, let's move this project from development into \u2018we're going to move forward\u2019 in that short of a time horizon.\u201d\n\nNormally, these auctions are spaced a year apart \u2014 it gives people an opportunity to respond.\n\nEven so, you're seeing people make affirmative decisions about investments, delaying retirement, projects that were not moving forward are now back on the drawing board. You see things like the Crane Clean Energy Center, formerly Three Mile Island \u2026 you are seeing that come back. So I think there are all kinds of indicators that show that the market is responding to the signals that are being sent.\n\nWould it be helpful if we could move faster? Sure, it would be. Is that always possible? Honestly, no. We've got issues outside of queue reform, which everyone likes to blame, and which I think is kind of behind us, if you look at the statistics.\n\nBut there are supply chain issues that affect everybody, whether you're a vertically integrated utility, or you're a competitive power generator, or you're a rural co-op or public power. We're all subject to the same issues with regard to supply chain.\n\nAnd there's a workforce issue that we're going to have to address because, assuming we all agree \u2026 that we're going to need to build a whole lot of new megawatts in the coming near-term time horizon, everybody's competing for the workforce that's skilled and able to construct those facilities.\n\nI hear some of our utility critics say, \u201cWell, if you just let us do it, we\u2019d have this problem solved.\u201d Well, I'd like to know how you're able to skip ahead and have your equipment, whether it's switchgears or transformers or turbines. We're all competing for the same equipment on the same time horizon, so it's a little bit difficult to understand how they could do it so much faster, so much cheaper, when that's historically never been the case.\n\nIf somebody were to order a turbine today, how long would it take to get it?\n\nIt varies, but conventional wisdom right now is it's probably five years, maybe six. We've seen some discussion about how we are going to address additional manufacturing capability, and I think we'll see that. But you don't build a new factory overnight, and you certainly don't turn out these pieces of equipment in a week or two.\n\nWhat about getting fuel supply for gas-fired power plants? I've heard pipelines are very tight. Storage is tight.\n\nIt varies by region. So if you're New England, you've got a different set of issues than if you're in central Pennsylvania or Ohio, where you're sitting on top of the gas, where it's being produced, and it's much easier to move around.\n\nWe are going to need to see some additional pipeline capacity that's going to take gas from where it's being produced into other parts of the country where they are bottlenecked, whether that's the Southeast or the Northeast.\n\nWhat about the cost of building a new gas-fired power plant? I'm seeing roughly $2,200 to $2,500 per kilowatt.\n\nThat range sounds pretty close to what we have heard, which is much more than it was three or five years ago. From our members\u2019 perspective, that's cost that they bear, that's not anything that's put on the backs of ratepayers. In a vertically integrated environment in contrast, that $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion for 1,000 megawatts has to be paid by someone, and that's the captive utility customer with a non-bypassable charge on the bill. And so that's a direct pass-through to customers, plus the rate of return that the utility gets, where, if our members build it, they've got to make sure that they build it as inexpensively but as reliably as they can so they can operate, and that has the effect of driving down costs for consumers.\n\nHow are your members navigating this new import tariff landscape?\n\nWe have some members that are in the process of trying to get equipment into the United States and not sure what the price will be when it hits the shore based on the tariff rate with the countries that it may be coming from. For one member, the price variation was potentially 40% higher. So if you've got a $100 million piece of equipment, and the price is either $100 million or $140 million, that's meaningful dollars. That is an area that our members are hoping that we can get some greater degree of certainty because if we're going to achieve the administration's objective of beating China at AI, we're going to need more energy. More energy that is going to be produced with the same turbines that potentially are exposed to some of the tariff-related issues. There is some disruptive effect to that, but I think the administration is aware of it.\n\nHow is EPSA thinking about the issue of affordability?\n\nWe are one of the best ways for people to mitigate those costs by avoiding non-bypassable charges and letting us be the ones who put the risk on shareholders and investors for the generation portion of your bill.\n\nTransmission and distribution charges are up substantially over the last 10 years, 15 years, and those costs are real and have translated into increased costs on consumers\u2019 bills. So I find it a little disingenuous for some of the utilities that have had the transmission and distribution charges go up substantially over that period of time to say that this one capacity auction and now a second capacity auction is what's driving up customer bills, and that's why they should be allowed back in the [generation] game, because if you look at it in raw data numbers, the facts just don't support their thesis.\n\nIn fact, the generation portion is flat or declining, and it has been that way as a result of both fuel switching, improved efficiency and new resources that came onto the system. But because of the most recent auction results, I think it's a useful tool for those people who are trying to push responsibility for price increases off of their portion of the bill and onto someone else.\n\nDo you have concerns about politicians feeling the pressure around affordability and asking themselves if restructuring is getting us more needed generation?\n\nWe're always mindful of the need for people to do something. Sometimes that means doing something that's not necessarily good policy. We\u2019re trying to educate policymakers and legislators about what markets are actually doing, what they have actually delivered.\n\nI'm still hard-pressed to find an example where a vertically-integrated utility has delivered a new generating project on time and under budget and had any accountability in the way that wholesale power generators do.\n\nSome people have been pointing to the consolidation in the power sector as a sign that the markets aren't working. In PJM, people are preferring to just buy existing gas-fired power plants. What\u2019s behind the consolidation?\n\nOur members all have different perspectives that they are operating under. Some are typically more operator-driven and others are more development-driven. Those that are in the development space are working on a number of projects in PJM as we speak, so I would urge a little caution from those who are suggesting that there's no new development in gas.\n\nSome companies are trying to acquire resources, to build their portfolio, because those entities have a different investment thesis, which is, \u201cWe're operators, not developers.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Record PJM power prices spark debate over utility generation bans.\n\n**Key details:** PJM Interconnection capacity prices recently hit a record high of nearly $330/MW-day, fueling a debate over new power generation. Companies like Exelon and PPL Corp. contend these high prices increase customer bills but fail to spur independent power producers (IPPs) to build new plants, and are pressing for legislation to lift restrictions on utilities owning generation. However, the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) reports IPPs are responding, with 51 projects totaling 10,000 MW expected online by 2030 via PJM\u2019s Reliability Resource Initiative. IPPs also face significant challenges, including compressed auction schedules, global supply chain issues (like 5-6 year turbine delivery times), and workforce shortages.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information directly challenges the utility consensus view that rising PJM capacity prices are failing to incentivize new power plant construction by independent producers. The article suggests IPPs are actively responding to market signals, but their efforts are hampered by broader economic and logistical hurdles. It highlights a fundamental disagreement on the responsibility and cost-bearing for new generation, with IPPs arguing their model places risk on shareholders, not ratepayers. The dispute also raises questions about the effectiveness of current market structures and state-level utility regulations.\n\n**The big picture:** The PJM Interconnection region has seen significant spikes in capacity prices, leading to increased electricity costs for consumers. Some utility companies, prohibited from owning power generation in certain states, are advocating for legislative changes to re-enter the generation market. They argue this would help stabilize prices and ensure new supply. Independent power producers, represented by EPSA, offer a counter-narrative, detailing their ongoing efforts to develop new projects despite market and external constraints that affect all types of power providers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Nearly $330/MW-day:** Record high for PJM capacity prices last month.\n*   **10,000 MW:** Capacity from 51 projects selected through PJM's Reliability Resource Initiative, due online by 2030.\n*   **5-6 years:** Estimated delivery time for a new turbine after ordering.\n*   **$2,200-$2,500 per kilowatt:** Estimated cost to build a new gas-fired power plant.\n*   **40%:** Potential increase in equipment price due to import tariffs for one member.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **PJM Interconnection:** Regional transmission organization experiencing record capacity price spikes.\n*   **Exelon:** Utility company advocating for state legislation to allow utility ownership of power generation.\n*   **FirstEnergy:** Utility contending PJM price increases are not spurring independent power plant construction.\n*   **PPL Corp.:** Utility firm pressing for legislative changes to lift generation ownership restrictions.\n*   **Todd Snitchler:** President and CEO of Electric Power Supply Association, representing independent power producers.\n*   **Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA):** Trade group for independent power producers detailing their market response and challenges.\n*   **Invenergy:** Member of EPSA operating capacity in competitive wholesale electricity markets.\n*   **LS Power:** Member of EPSA making affirmative investment decisions in response to price signals.\n*   **NRG Energy:** Member of EPSA involved in bringing electricity supplies to the PJM region.\n*   **Talen Energy:** Member of EPSA, part of the competitive generator sector.\n*   **Tenaska:** Member of EPSA, a competitive power generator facing supply chain issues.\n*   **Vistra:** Member of EPSA, navigating import tariffs and workforce challenges.\n*   **Utility Dive:** News outlet that conducted the interview for the article.\n*   **Crane Clean Energy Center:** Project formerly known as Three Mile Island, now back on the drawing board.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Record PJM prices intensify debate on power market design and who builds new generation.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSan Francisco is often touted as a poster child for waste reduction. In 2009 it became the first U.S. city to adopt mandatory recycling and composting. But when it comes to compliance, this bright green city has a dark side: apartment buildings.\n\n\u201cOut of all the sectors, multifamily struggles the most with contamination,\u201d said Freddy Coronado, residential zero waste specialist for the San Francisco Environment Department. Multifamily properties account for many of the city\u2019s large refuse generators \u2014 buildings that produce at least 40 cubic yards or more of uncompacted refuse per week. And upwards of 75% of them fail waste-stream audits that the city performs, according to Coronado.\n\nThe audits are required as part of the city\u2019s Refuse Separation Ordinance, which it enacted in 2019. The RSO covers roughly 450 buildings, including 150 multifamily dwellings, which generate 20% of San Francisco\u2019s waste stream.\n\nProperties that fail an audit must hire a service provider to perform onsite sortation for at least two years. The city offers training to these providers, called zero waste facilitators, to ensure they sort properly. These organizations take that role very seriously by ripping open every trash bag to pull out recyclable and organic waste. That\u2019s because the city has strict contamination thresholds: up to 25% in the waste stream, 10% for recycling and 5% for organics.\n\nWhile many municipalities don\u2019t have these types of rules, there\u2019s still a growing demand for onsite sortation and other high-touch waste handling services at multifamily properties across the country. These companies help improve recycling and organics diversion, address persistent illegal dumping and even collect waste from residents\u2019 doorsteps in a service known as trash valet.\n\nTrash valet is the second most-requested amenity in the multifamily sector right now (behind pet infrastructure, like play areas and waste stations), said Kevin Schwartz, senior director of governmental affairs for Valet Living.\n\nSchwartz said the company collects trash, recycling (and in some markets, organics) from more than six million residents, usually five nights per week. The company is increasingly providing onsite sortation, sometimes separately from doorstep collection, in California, Oregon and Washington, as well as cities with organics diversion requirements like Austin, Texas, and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nProviders are looking to offer more of these types of services to multifamily clients, as indicated by Ally Waste\u2019s recent acquisition of California-based WasteXperts, which has provided multifamily recycling and diversion services for decades.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, we were just a pure play valet trash company,\u201d said Ally Waste COO Harrison Crum. \u201cThat's a very niche service only for multifamily. And what we realized is that properties have a lot more trash issues than just getting trash from doorstep to dumpster.\u201d\n\nThe business model\n\nIn 2012, Lainika Johnson joined Republic Services as a sales representative in Sacramento, California. She knew nothing about the waste industry, but that quickly changed.\n\n\u201cI asked if I could move my desk to the window so I could watch the transfer station floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was fascinating to me \u2026 but to other people, they were probably like, \u2018okay, you're a little crazy about trash.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s interests eventually moved upstream as she fielded more and more questions from commercial customers about California\u2019s recycling and organics regulations, and concerns about how to handle illegal dumping on their properties. She took a sales role with Valet Living, and eventually decided to branch out on her own, founding TrashLogic in 2016.\n\nToday, TrashLogic provides waste handling and sortation services to commercial and multifamily properties. Its first step, Johnson explained, is generally to look over a client\u2019s recent hauler charges and observe residents\u2019 behaviors to see what they toss, where and how often.\n\n\u201cIt's about redesigning the whole system of waste, not just coming in and saying, \u2018oh, we can clean up your [waste] enclosures,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, TrashLogic determines whether the property has too many bins or dumpsters, or if they\u2019re poorly placed. Some might be overly full and others not maximized. By changing how the waste and recycling collection areas are designed, Johnson said, TrashLogic can often lower properties\u2019 hauling costs and reduce overage fees and contamination penalties that some haulers charge.\n\n\u201cWe charge for our service and our service costs. Usually the [client\u2019s] savings covers most of our cost,\u201d she said.\n\nMiyon Mael, chief growth officer at WasteXperts, noted that service adjustments can be very effective in areas with high hauler fees, like Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cEven though you may have overage charges or overflowing containers, it doesn't necessarily mean that those materials are being placed in the right containers. So with boots on the ground we can actually divert that material, place them in the right containers and we could definitely drive down some trash costs,\u201d said Mael.\n\nTrash valet services are often billed directly to tenants. A quick survey of rates from various companies in the San Francisco area show that fees range from $20 to $40 per month, per unit. Outside of valet services, Mael said that some properties are able to bill back costs of waste collection to tenants, in municipalities that consider it a utility.\n\nLarge apartment buildings in urban areas often collect waste centrally, generally using trash chutes. Newer construction or renovated properties sometimes have up to three chutes for different materials \u2014 or a retrofitted chute that allows residents to direct waste to different bins using integrated diverters. But the diverters can be difficult for residents to use and are prone to clogging, said Coronado.\n\nMael said WasteXperts provides green compostable bags for food waste and instructs residents to send them down trash chutes. Even if the waste streams are commingled, she said, the bags are easy to divert. \u201cBecause it is a translucent bag, we can easily identify if there's contamination [mixed in with the organics],\u201d she said.\n\nCoronado noted that many large buildings in San Francisco have had to remove trash compactors in order to reduce contamination by making it easier for sorters to access refuse. And new apartment buildings in the city are now required to install three separate trash chutes.\n\nStaying on top of bulk items in less dense complexes with large parking lots is key, Johnson said. Waste can add up once a location becomes known as a dumping site and sometimes people who don\u2019t live at the apartment complex dump there, too.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of TVs, we see a lot of furniture and we see a lot of car parts,\u201d explained Aaron Lee, a waste flow technician supervisor at TrashLogic.\n\nManaging bulky items such as furniture and mattresses can be a challenge for multifamily buildings. Jodi Jacobson via Getty Images\n\nChanging behavior\n\nImproving multifamily recycling is an ongoing challenge, and one that experts say requires ongoing education and engagement.\n\nMael said part of the problem is a lack of accountability in large communities, since it can be very difficult to tie high rates of contamination to particular residents.\n\n\u201cTenants move in and move [out], and there are language barriers, cultural barriers,\u201d to proper sorting and reducing contamination, said Coronado.\n\nSan Francisco is trying different approaches to improve compliance, from door-to-door outreach, to holding educational meetings for residents with refreshments. But, ultimately, the steep penalties and requirements to hire zero waste facilitators is what really moves the needle for property managers.\n\nIn San Francisco multifamily buildings face two different financial incentives to remain in compliance with the city\u2019s diversion requirements and to avoid contamination.\n\nIf a property fails a waste stream audit, it must create and share a compliance plan with the city, which includes hiring a zero waste facilitator. Failing to do so within four months triggers an administrative penalty of $500 per day for up to 60 days, and the fees increase from there.\n\nThe buildings are also subject to contamination fees based on inspections from the city\u2019s franchise hauler, Recology. Those fees can be up to 50% of the property\u2019s bill, which can easily add hundreds or thousands of dollars, each month. Coronado said the potential for these steep fines has resulted in a high compliance rate among properties that fail audits, and that the city has not yet charged administrative or contamination fees to multifamily properties.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence and automation are gaining traction in many parts of the recycling system, the companies that provide manual sortation don\u2019t see demand for their services decreasing any time soon. Miyon Mael, Aaron Lee and Kevin Schwartz all agreed that it won\u2019t be a concern until robots are able to climb stairs, drive trucks, jump into dumpsters and deftly sort all manner of trash.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEnviri is exploring a potential sale of Clean Earth six years after it acquired the company, executives said during an earnings call on Tuesday. The announcement comes as other divisions of the company drag on earnings and Enviri\u2019s board of directors looks to improve the company\u2019s value in public markets.\n\n\u201cAs we seek to close the persistent gap between Enviri\u2019s public market valuation and the company\u2019s sum-of-the-parts value, the board has authorized a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives,\u201d Enviri Chairman and CEO Nick Grasberger said in a release. \u201cWe are approaching this process with clarity, discipline, and an open mind, assisted by our outside advisors and guided by our commitment to maximize shareholder value.\u201d\n\nClean Earth, which previously grew under private equity ownership, provides a range of hazardous and specialty waste services to commercial, industrial and residential markets. When Enviri, previously known as Harsco, acquired Clean Earth in 2019, it was considered one of the largest service providers of its kind in the country.\n\nGrasberger said Enviri couldn\u2019t disclose many details of the potential sale, and did not give a timeline on the company\u2019s earnings call Tuesday, but he noted that the company would pursue all available options.\n\nQ2 2025 Enviri segment revenues Clean Earth: $246M Up 4.2% year over year Harsco Environmental: $258M Down 12% year over year Harsco Rail: $58M Down 28.4% year over year\n\nEnviri acquired Clean Earth from Compass Group Diversified Holdings for $625 million. The business brought in a substantial portfolio of specialty waste processing infrastructure. It had 27 facilities at the time of the acquisition, including nine hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities. In 2020, Enviri added to Clean Earth's portfolio by acquiring Stericycle\u2019s environmental solutions business for $462.5 million.\n\nThe company transitioned to deriving 100% of its revenue from environmentally focused business by 2023. The Clean Earth division has outperformed other business segments in Enviri in recent years, particularly Harsco Rail. The company previously tried to divest its rail assets, but paused that process early last year due to outstanding contracts in Europe, Grasberger told analysts.\n\nOver the past year, the company has considered other levers to boost revenue amid a slumping steel market affecting demand for Harsco Environmental\u2019s services and other macroeconomic headwinds. That includes divestitures \u2014 in August 2024, the company sold Reed Minerals to Speyside Equity for $45 million.\n\nThere has also been a shuffle in leadership. At the start of the fiscal year, Enviri announced that two directors with more than 10 years of tenure retired from its board, including the former lead independent director David Everitt. Nicholas Fanandakis, the former CFO of DuPont, was nominated to join the board at that time.\n\nThe environmental services and specialty waste industry segments have seen strong valuations over the past year. GFL sold a majority stake in its environmental services business for approximately $5.6 billion earlier this year. Triumvirate also recently received an investment from Berkshire Partners that valued the company at $1.8 billion. And WM acquired Stericycle for $7.2 billion late last year, absorbing one of the largest medical waste service providers.\n\nGrasberger expressed confidence in Enviri\u2019s underlying business, noting that the company would continue to improve the rail business and that Harsco Environmental \u201cis a market leader with unmatched service capabilities and a strong earnings and cash flow profile.\u201d\n\n\u201cClean Earth is an especially valuable business and in an attractive and consolidating industry,\u201d Grasberger said. \u201cWith that said, we think there may be alternatives to unlock this value sooner.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Enviri explores Clean Earth sale to boost shareholder value.\n\n**Key details:** Enviri is exploring a potential sale of its Clean Earth division, announced during an earnings call on Tuesday. The company\u2019s board has authorized a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to address a \"persistent gap\" between its public market valuation and its \"sum-of-the-parts value.\" Enviri acquired Clean Earth in 2019. Executives did not disclose specific details or a timeline for the potential sale.\n\n**Why it matters:** This potential sale is significant as Enviri aims to \"maximize shareholder value\" by closing a \"persistent gap\" in its public market valuation. The move suggests the company believes its current market price does not reflect its true \"sum-of-the-parts value.\" Given that the environmental services industry has seen \"strong valuations\" recently, Enviri's decision to sell Clean Earth challenges a consensus that the market is accurately pricing its asset value. Clean Earth has also \"outperformed other business segments\" within Enviri.\n\n**The big picture:** Enviri, formerly known as Harsco, transitioned to deriving 100% of its revenue from environmentally focused business by 2023. This involved the 2019 acquisition of Clean Earth for $625 million, and adding Stericycle\u2019s environmental solutions business in 2020 for $462.5 million. Other divisions, like Harsco Environmental and Harsco Rail, have been dragging on earnings. The broader environmental services and specialty waste industry has recently experienced strong valuations and consolidation, including significant acquisitions and investments.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Clean Earth Q2 2025 Revenue: $246 million, up 4.2% year over year.\n*   Harsco Environmental Q2 2025 Revenue: $258 million, down 12% year over year.\n*   Harsco Rail Q2 2025 Revenue: $58 million, down 28.4% year over year.\n*   Clean Earth acquired in 2019 for $625 million.\n*   Stericycle's environmental solutions acquired in 2020 for $462.5 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Enviri:** Company exploring the potential sale of its Clean Earth division to boost value.\n*   **Clean Earth:** Enviri division being explored for sale, outperformed other business segments.\n*   **Nick Grasberger:** Enviri Chairman and CEO, announced strategic review to maximize shareholder value.\n*   **Harsco:** Former name of Enviri, which acquired Clean Earth in 2019.\n*   **Compass Group Diversified Holdings:** Sold Clean Earth to Enviri for $625 million.\n*   **Stericycle:** Its environmental solutions business was acquired by Enviri for $462.5 million.\n*   **Reed Minerals:** Sold by Enviri to Speyside Equity for $45 million in August 2024.\n*   **Speyside Equity:** Acquired Reed Minerals from Enviri for $45 million in August 2024.\n*   **David Everitt:** Retired from Enviri's board, formerly lead independent director.\n*   **Nicholas Fanandakis:** Nominated to join Enviri's board at the start of the fiscal year.\n*   **DuPont:** Former employer of Nicholas Fanandakis, where he served as CFO.\n*   **GFL:** Sold majority stake in its environmental services business for approximately $5.6 billion.\n*   **Triumvirate:** Received investment from Berkshire Partners, valuing company at $1.8 billion.\n*   **Berkshire Partners:** Made an investment in Triumvirate, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.\n*   **WM:** Acquired Stericycle for $7.2 billion late last year.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Enviri explores selling key asset to close persistent valuation gap.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThis is the latest installment in Waste Dive\u2019s Biogas Monthly series.\n\nEnvironmental groups are opening up new forms of opposition to clean fuels credits that reward farm biogas in two states. If successful, they could reduce the strong incentive farm owners receive to convert biogas from manure into renewable natural gas.\n\nIn California, a coalition of environmental groups led by Food & Water Watch sued the California Air Resources Board on July 25. They allege that the Low Carbon Fuel Standard amendments that went into effect on July 1 unlawfully expand support for farm biogas and lock in negative impacts to communities near factory farms. The groups specifically hope to reverse avoided methane crediting, a policy that gives factory farm biogas particularly strong carbon intensity scores that boosts the price they charge for the credits they generate.\n\n\u201cThis new suit aims to bring CARB back in line with its obligations to honestly and equitably address the climate crisis under California\u2019s climate laws,\u201d Tyler Lobdell, staff attorney at Food & Water Watch, said in a statement. \u201cCARB doubling down on false climate solutions like factory farm biogas is bad for the climate and bad for Californians, and now we\u2019re arguing it\u2019s illegal as well.\u201d\n\nFood & Water Watch is joined by Central Valley Defenders of Clean Air and Water, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Center for Food Safety in its lawsuit. The California Air Resources Board did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.\n\nClean fuel standards have become subject to increasing political pressure in recent months as state and federal lawmakers \u2014 encouraged by the Trump administration \u2014 have prioritized gas prices for consumers over aggressive climate action.\n\nIn a related update, the LCFS appears to have survived an attempt to cap credit prices at January 2025 levels. That proposed change was included as part of SB 237, a bill introduced in the California legislature to make gasoline more affordable. The language was removed from the bill, which is still making its way through the legislature, in July.\n\nFood & Water Watch is also pressuring New Mexico regulators to not include avoided methane crediting in the state\u2019s own that state\u2019s clean fuels policy. New Mexico\u2019s Clean Transportation Fuel Standards are still being shaped by the state\u2019s Environmental Improvement Board. The CTFS program was created through a bill signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in March 2024.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s agency staff have released multiple draft proposals for the fuel standards, with the more recent proposal making carbon intensity scores for factory farm biogas less lucrative, Lobdell said on a recent webinar.\n\nThe environmental group is urging New Mexico residents to keep up pressure on the Environmental Improvement Board ahead of its late September meeting where it will next debate the fuel standards. The board could finalize the standards at that time.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to enrich and entrench factory farms,\u201d Emily Tucker, New Mexico organizer with Food & Water Watch, said on the webinar. \u201cWe must not import this policy from California into New Mexico, especially when that policy has led to numerous legal challenges and is opposed by environmental justice advocates across California.\u201d\n\nDespite activist pushback, new biogas projects and deals progressed in July. Below are a selection of updates from the industry.\n\nCredit pricing as of July 31, 2025 D3 RIN prices: $2.185 Up from $2.175 in 2024 D5 RIN prices: $1.185 Up from $1.105 in 2024 $110.00 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in Oregon\u2019s Clean Fuels Program $59.19 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Source: EcoEngineers Carbon Market Snapshot\n\nRepublic Services brings sixth facility online\n\nAmeresco partnered with Republic Services to open a landfill-gas-to-RNG facility in Dixon, Illinois, the companies announced in July. It's Republic's sixth such facility to open in 2025, with one more scheduled to come online by the end of the year, CEO Jon Vander Ark said on the company's earnings call last week.\n\nLocated at the Lee County Landfill, this is the 15th facility produced by the two partners. They expect it to produce 1.2 million mmBtus of RNG annually.\n\nRepublic continues to progress on its RNG production goals, part of its broader emissions reduction activities. The company said it beneficially reused 76.9 billion standard cubic feet of landfill gas in 2024, per its most recent sustainability report.\n\nSagepoint Energy adds landfill facility\n\nSagepoint Energy reached a deal with North American Power Systems to acquire a landfill-gas-to-electricity facility in Birch Run, Michigan. Sagepoint will convert the Peoples LFG plant to an RNG-producing facility.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of Peoples is a strategic advancement in expanding and strengthening our RNG portfolio,\u201d Sagepoint CEO Aaron Johnson said in a release. \u201cBy converting this landfill gas-to-electricity plant into an RNG facility, we are enhancing our operational capabilities and driving increased renewable natural gas production.\u201d\n\nSagepoint plans to begin construction in 2025 and start commercial operation next year.\n\nThis is the third acquisition by Sagepoint in 2025. The Indiana-based company was formed by Ares Management in April. Sagepoint is working to increase its portfolio of landfill gas projects through M&A this year, Johnson told Waste Dive.\n\nWaga Energy refinances Canadian facilities\n\nFrench RNG company Waga Energy closed a $25 million (Canadian) loan to refinance three Quebec facilities, the company announced. This is the company's first refinancing transaction in Canada.\n\nEquitable and the Empire Life Insurance Co. provided the 19-year loan. The company will pay down construction debt with some of the proceeds. It says the loan will strengthen Waga's cash position and allow it to pursue new facilities in Canada and internationally.\n\nWaga has been expanding rapidly in North America in recent years, with seven plants in operation and 13 under construction. The company continues to negotiate with EQT Transition Infrastructure, which offered to acquire a majority stake in Waga in June. Waga's board of directors previously expressed unanimous support for the deal. If they agree to proceed, the parties would file the offer with French regulators by year\u2019s end.\n\nBTS Bioenergy expands Maryland footprint\n\nBTS Bioenergy, which runs the Maryland Bioenergy Center, opened a new satellite facility to assist with feedstock consolidation. The new Maryland Organics Recovery Center takes palletized food waste from distribution partners and separates organics for processing at the MBC.\n\nBTS Bioenergy, formerly known as Bioenergy Devco, is in the process of improving operations in Maryland, where it's operated an anaerobic digestion facility since 2021. CEO Nick Thomas told Waste Dive in June that he was looking to refocus the company's mission this year and double down on revenue-generating facilities like MBC.\n\n\u201cMORC represents a strategic expansion of our infrastructure that enables BTS Bioenergy to better serve the food distribution sector while advancing our mission of landfill diversion,\u201d Thomas said in a statement announcing the Maryland expansion.",

They specifically target \"avoided methane crediting,\" which boosts biogas credit prices. Food & Water Watch is also pressuring New Mexico regulators to exclude similar crediting from their Clean Transportation Fuel Standards.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese legal and lobbying efforts, if successful, could reduce the strong financial incentives for converting farm manure into renewable natural gas. This directly challenges the current consensus that lucrative clean fuel credits for farm biogas will continue without significant opposition, potentially impacting project profitability.

Oregon had the distinction this year of becoming the first U.S. state to have its program go live.\n\nEPR programs in different industries have long existed in other countries. While many packaging industry stakeholders were skeptical of EPR in the U.S., some groups have come to support recently passed legislation in states including Minnesota, Washington and Maryland. To date, seven states in total have passed these types of laws, each with slightly different parameters.

It acquired WB Waste Solutions in the second quarter, a deal that nets WM additional commercial and industrial density in the mid-Atlantic region. WM also acquired Miller Recycling in Massachusetts in May.\n\nPresident John Morris said he expected \"one fairly sizable\" deal to close in the second half of the year, and said WM's pipeline remains robust.\n\n\"We've talked about last year being probably one of our strongest years, and a lot of that is carried over into this year.

Notable Q2 acquisitions include Town & Country Sanitation and Peterson Sanitation in Wisconsin.\n\nBesides the Shamrock Environmental deal, the company expects acquisitions it made so far this year to contribute about $35 million of annual revenue, CFO Brian DelGhiaccio said.\n\nThe company plans to continue executing on its pipeline of tuck-in acquisitions. CEO Jon Vander Ark said he doesn't \"see any transformational deals in the immediate term.\" Future deals are expected across recycling, solid waste and environmental services.\n\nThe company has already had an \u201coutsized\u201d year of acquisition activity, CEO Ron Mittelstaedt said, with deals representing about $200 million in annualized revenue. About $75 million in annualized revenue came from deals closed in Q2, including an E&P acquisition in Canada, he said. The company acquired 10 solid waste collection and recycling businesses and two E&P businesses in the first six months of the year. That\u2019s compared to 14 solid waste and 2 E&P businesses acquired in the same period in 2024.\n\nWaste Connections expects to close another $100 million to $200 million in acquisitions later this year, or by early 2026. Mittelstaedt said the company has \u201ctremendous firepower, both through free cash flow and available capital,\u201d to complete the deals as part of an \u201cenormous year.\u201d\n\nThose deals are expected to be all solid waste deals that are \u201cwell dispersed\u201d across Waste Connections\u2019 footprint, including some West Coast franchises and some in \u201ccompetitive markets in the South and Midwest and the East,\u201d he said.\n\nAll financial information in Canadian dollars\n\nGFL had a quiet second quarter for M&A, with business acquisitions and investments down nearly 90% year over year. The company completed three tuck-in deals in the quarter in Michigan and Minnesota, and expects the acquisitions it\u2019s completed in the first half of 2025 to generate about $105 million in annualized revenue.\n\nCEO Patrick Dovigi said the company has been quiet in the first half of 2025 as it works to finalize major deals involving its environmental services segment and Green Infrastructure Partners, its privately held spin-off. Nevertheless, executives still expect to spend $900 million on acquisitions by the year\u2019s end.\n\nIn response to questions, Dovigi also said he didn't expect the Trump administration's more business friendly approach to acquisition activity to have much of an impact on M&A strategy.\n\n\"For large-scale M&A, I guess in theory the process maybe will get more straightforward and maybe a little less scrutiny, but by and large we've never had an issue getting through the [Hart-Scott-Rodino] process,\" Dovigi said.\n\nCasella has already completed six acquisitions so far this year, which represent about $90 million in annualized revenues. Three of those acquisitions took place in Q2, totaling over $40 million of annualized revenues, said President Ned Coletta.\n\nThose acquisitions included a deal in an existing market in Casella\u2019s Western region that will allow the company to better consolidate routes, added CEO John Casella. Casella acquired Seyrek Disposal, a small New York hauler, in April. It acquired Gerber\u2019s, a commercial hauler in Maryland, in May.\n\n\n\nCasella is entering the second half of 2025 with an acquisition pipeline of about $500 million in annualized revenue opportunities, executives said. Casella also expects to close on the acquisition of Mountain Waste in Q4, a deal meant to generate about $30 million of annualized revenues. Mountain Waste offers residential, commercial and industrial services throughout West Virginia and parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Solid Waste M&A Slows in Q2, But Major Deals Anticipated Later\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. solid waste industry's five largest publicly traded companies collectively spent approximately $659 million on acquisitions in the second quarter. This marks a notable decrease from the $1.5 billion in deals announced during the first quarter. WM led Q2 spending with $363 million, while Waste Connections spent $130.3 million, and Casella Waste Systems $71.5 million. Republic Services recorded $62 million in Q2 acquisitions, and GFL Environmental spent $32.6 million. Executives provided varying insights into their future M&A strategies, with some anticipating significant deals in the latter half of the year.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe substantial drop in Q2 M&A spending suggests a moderation from the aggressive pace seen earlier in the year, potentially challenging a consensus view of sustained, high-volume acquisition activity. However, this slowdown appears to be more a shift in timing than a complete halt, as several key players still project significant spending by year-end. WM, Waste Connections, and GFL Environmental all expect to close large acquisitions, indicating strategic deals are being finalized. This nuanced outlook suggests the industry remains active in M&A, but with a focus on larger, potentially more impactful transactions emerging later in the year, rather than numerous smaller deals.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe U.S. solid waste industry's landscape is dominated by five major publicly traded companies: WM, Republic Services, Waste Connections, GFL Environmental, and Casella Waste Systems. These companies frequently engage in mergers and acquisitions as a primary strategy for growth, market expansion, and service consolidation. Their M&A spending totals are generally reported net of cash acquired, though specific methodologies can vary between firms. Executives regularly use earnings calls to communicate their acquisition pipelines and strategic outlooks, providing context for the sector's ongoing consolidation trends.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Total Q2 acquisition spend by the five largest public companies: $659 million\n*   Total Q1 acquisition spend by the five largest public companies: $1.5 billion\n*   WM's Q2 acquisition spend: $363 million\n*   Waste Connections expects to close another $100 million to $200 million (Canadian dollars) in acquisitions later this year or by early 2026.\n*   GFL Environmental expects to spend $900 million on acquisitions by year-end.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **WM:** Led Q2 spending, projects $500M total 2024 acquisitions, anticipates robust pipeline.\n*   **Republic Services:** Moderated Q2 activity, focuses on tuck-in deals, no immediate transformational deals.\n*   **Waste Connections:** \"Outsized\" acquisition year, expects more solid waste deals with strong capital.\n*   **GFL Environmental:** Quiet Q2, but finalizing major deals, expects $900M total acquisition spend.\n*   **Casella Waste Systems:** Active with six YTD acquisitions, strong pipeline includes Mountain Waste.\n*   **John Morris (WM):** President, anticipates a sizable H2 deal and robust acquisition pipeline.\n*   **Brian DelGhiaccio (Republic Services):** CFO, noted Q2 deals contribute $35M in annual revenue.\n*   **Jon Vander Ark (Republic Services):** CEO, stated no \"transformational deals\" expected immediately.\n*   **Ron Mittelstaedt (Waste Connections):** CEO, called the acquisition year \"outsized\" with \"tremendous firepower.\"\n*   **Patrick Dovigi (GFL Environmental):** CEO, explained Q2 quietness due to finalizing major deals.\n*   **Ned Coletta (Casella Waste Systems):** President, confirmed three Q2 acquisitions for over $40M annualized revenue.\n*   **John Casella (Casella Waste Systems):** CEO, detailed a Q2 acquisition enabling route consolidation in Western region.\n*   **WB Waste Solutions:** Acquired by WM, enhancing commercial and industrial density in mid-Atlantic.\n*   **Miller Recycling:** Acquired by WM in Massachusetts during May.\n*   **Shamrock Environmental:** Republic Services' major purchase earlier in the year.\n*   **Town & Country Sanitation:** Acquired by Republic Services in Wisconsin during Q2.\n*   **Peterson Sanitation:** Acquired by Republic Services in Wisconsin during Q2.\n*   **Green Infrastructure Partners:** GFL's privately held spin-off, involved in major deal finalization.\n*   **Seyrek Disposal:** Small New York hauler acquired by Casella in April.\n*   **Gerber's:** Commercial hauler in Maryland acquired by Casella in May.\n*   **Mountain Waste:** Casella expects to close acquisition in Q4, adding $30M annualized revenue.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   WM anticipates closing \"one fairly sizable\" acquisition in the second half of the year.\n*   Casella Waste Systems expects to finalize its Mountain Waste acquisition in Q4.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nSolid waste M&A cooled in Q2 but major deals are still anticipated for year-end.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFinancial picture: During the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call on Friday, CEO John Casella characterized the quarter as a time of \u201cstrong growth,\u201d particularly due to stable performance across the company\u2019s Northeast footprint and improved landfill tons compared to this time last year. Revenue growth for the quarter was mainly driven by the rollover impact from acquisitions and \u201csustained\u201d collection and disposal price growth, he said.\n\nM&A: Casella completed six acquisitions in the first half of this year, representing over $90 million in annualized revenue. Three of those deals closed in Q2, totalling over $40 million in annualized revenues, said President Ned Coletta. The acquisition pipeline for 2025 has over $500 million of annualized revenue opportunities, he said. The company\u2019s strategy is to solidify investments it\u2019s made along the Eastern Seaboard, including the Mid-Atlantic, while also seeking new business in those regions, John Casella added.\n\nMountain State Waste acquisition: Casella announced in July that it planned to acquire Mountain State Waste in West Virginia, which will add an incremental $30 million of annualized revenues after it closes. The acquisition will help broaden Casella's footprint in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky. The company\u2019s West Virginia base and location near the college town of Morgantown \u201cwill give us a lot of growth,\u201d John Casella said.\n\nMid-Atlantic optimization hurdles: Labor costs in the Mid-Atlantic region are currently \u201chundreds of basis points higher\u201d than in other regions where Casella operates, in part because \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of automation and optimization of routes, and that won\u2019t all get solved at once,\u201d Coletta said. At the same time, truck delivery delays have further slowed optimization plans.\n\nTruck and route optimization: Casella expects about 55 more trucks to be delivered to the Mid-Atlantic region later in the year, 40 of which are automated, he said. Meanwhile, the company completed 11 other route optimization projects in the Eastern and Western regions that helped offset hurdles in the Mid-Atlantic, he said.\n\nPrice: Solid waste pricing for the quarter was up 5% year over year, with 4.9% collection price growth and 5.8% disposal price growth.\n\nVolumes: Landfill volumes were up 9.5% year over year, driven in part by higher third-party MSW and C&D volumes due to the ongoing effects of the Brookhaven Landfill closure in New York. Casella also saw over 12% growth in internalized volumes.\n\nResource Solutions: Resource Solutions revenues were up 10% year over year to about $95.8 million , with recycling and other processing revenue up 9.6%. Average commodity sales prices were down 16% from the previous year. However, higher volumes at Casella\u2019s MRFs in Boston and Willimantic, Connecticut, helped offset that price impact, said CFO Brad Helgeson.",

His company has made a name for itself as one of the largest electronics recyclers in the country, expanding over the years to do business in about 140 countries.\n\nAdvancements in the electronics at the heart of ERI\u2019s business model are also the reason Shegerian travels about 175 days a year, he said.\n\n\u201cWith technology, with AI, nobody knows what\u2019s real or fake anymore. But having real, personal relationships with clients and strategic partners \u2013 that\u2019s what sets us apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpersonal relationships you build with people face to face are now more important than ever before.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years, ERI has expanded its footprint across the U.S. It opened a new battery recycling plant in Indiana in 2024 and is getting ready to open an electronics recycling and IT asset disposition facility in Georgia. The company also plans to announce several international partnerships this year. This comes at a time when the U.S. government aims to prioritize domestic recycling initiatives in an effort to get back critical materials from electronics.\n\nERI is also balancing domestic and international business expansion with sustainability initiatives Shegerian said further set his company apart in a competitive field. \u201cIt doesn't matter if you\u2019re Republican, Independent or Democrat, everyone agrees that we want to leave the environment better than how we found it,\u201d he said.\n\nShegerian talked with Waste Dive about ERI\u2019s latest carbon neutral and zero waste initiatives, its focus on its battery and e-scrap services, and its relationship with the current Trump administration.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDomestic recycling infrastructure for electronics and batteries has seemed to really pick up in recent years, and you yourself have said competition can be fierce. What are ERI\u2019s priorities in this space, and how is it mapping its own growth?\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of ERI\n\nOnly 22% of all electronics being used today and sold and used on this planet today are being responsibly recycled. That still leaves a massive 78% delta for myself and all of my competitors to chase. People ask why I\u2019m friends with my competitors, and it\u2019s because we can learn a lot from them, and it's not a zero-sum game. There's so much stuff to recycle that we can all do very well together. It's really an industry of collaboration, and collaboration is what's going to make the biggest impact.\n\nOne example of collaboration that we\u2019ve had going since about 2005 is the electronic take-back programs with Best Buy and Staples, which is now the second most successful take-back program in the world for batteries and electronic waste. We also manage the Salvation Army take-back program now. We\u2019re always trying to get the word out, get more education and activation, because people want to do the right thing with electronics, they just don't know where it exists.\n\nWhen we take back all the batteries at Staples, you know about 85% of these postconsumer batteries are alkaline batteries. Our technology so far is doing very well at our recycling plant in Indiana, [which focuses on alkaline battery recycling]. It's closed loop, no emissions, and we create and sell a wonderful black mass there.\n\nAt the same time, we're opening other infrastructure. In the fourth quarter we plan to open our northwest Georgia location, which will do ITAD and electronics recycling, and we plan to continue to grow in other parts of the United States as well.\n\nWe are also going to grow outside of the country. We\u2019re getting more and more business in Asia, Canada, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We're going to be opening locations in those regions in the next 12 months in the form of ERI owned and operated [facilities], with partners in those regions.\n\nERI recently published its latest sustainability report, which says the company is the first in its industry to become carbon neutral . What steps did you take to do that, and why are these specific sustainability metrics important?\n\nWe started our company around 23 years ago, which is a lifetime ago when it comes to technology. That was before any company had a chief sustainability officer and \u201ccircular economy\u201d wasn\u2019t a word yet.\n\nIt does cost ERI more and requires more intentional work to be carbon neutral and to achieve zero waste. You just don't write a check and buy your way into it. Our carbon neutrality and zero waste efforts stand out really fast compared to our competitors.\n\nAll our big clients like the retailers, OEMs, cities and municipalities \u2014 they all have to answer to somebody and create sustainability or impact reports. We're one less problem on their balance sheet. We're not creating more scope 1, 2 or 3 issues for them.\n\nThe fact is, we have strategic partners that are investors and board members of ERI, so everyone knows where our materials go. Batteries go right to Redwood Materials. Alcoa gets all of our aluminum and LS MnM gets all of our copper and precious metals. People know there's no brokers. They see the transparency to that.\n\nWe have eight big facilities across America, but we never had a head of procurement until about two years ago, which is kind of embarrassing. Having a head of procurement is Sustainability 101. The march towards carbon neutrality becomes a lot easier when you're buying right and when you're diverting right.\n\nNo one's truly zero waste. We're at about 2.3% to 2.7% that goes to a hazardous waste landfill, but the rest gets diverted. Those efforts all came from our procurement and also from our chief sustainability officer efforts to increase and improve our diversion.\n\nOur sustainability officer and his team also look into how to power our facilities with green energy such as solar, and then whatever we can't do ourselves at the end of the day to zero out and reconcile this, then we'll buy credits.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pretty clear that it wants to see more investments in domestic manufacturing and the recovery of critical materials, which it says is important to stay internationally competitive and reduce reliance on other countries. What\u2019s ERI\u2019s role in these larger federal priorities?\n\nIn the last nine months, we've met with leadership from Canada, the United States and Japan. They all are interested in the same thing. They don't want to decouple from China, but they want to de-risk their resources and supply chain. The question on their minds is, \u201cHow can we recycle more electronics domestically and keep those material resources domestically?\u201d And that's what we've been asked to advise on.\n\nERI had an office in Washington, D.C. for 10 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we would walk the halls to meet with both sides of the aisle. Each side gave us wonderful lip service. The Republican people typically say, \u201cWe love the job growth that you're doing in our communities.\u201d The Democrats would say, \u201cWe love what you're doing for the environment.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s different with the Trump administration, love them or hate them, is that this is an administration of doers. They've come to us and said, \u201cGive us specifics. How can we retain more electronics, domestically speaking, and keep our resources domestic?\u201d They ask practical questions and they\u2019ve followed up with us numerous times. That\u2019s never happened in all the years I had an office in D.C.\n\nBy the way, the Canadian and Japanese governments are doing the same thing. I know each one of those administrations is going to do a lot more to make their countries safer and more independent and de-risk their supply chains. This is a high, high priority for all administrations of those three countries. This is just not idle chatter.\n\nERI is known for electronics and battery recycling, but you also do a fair amount of plastics recycling because of the plastics in electronics. How has that area of the business evolved over the years, especially in the context of your zero waste goals?\n\nPlastics have always been important to us. We built proprietary shredders back in 2008, and they have been upgraded every year. Those shredders create cleaner commodities, and smelters want the most liberated resources and commodities to smelt, because certain plastics will ruin their smelters.\n\nWhen OEMs started realizing that circularity and sustainability were trends, they all created design for sustainability divisions. One of the ways they want to make their products greener and more sustainable is by avoiding buying virgin plastic and instead buying back recycled plastic from me. We make sure it goes to a good vendor who can meet our specs. We've been working with OEMs for the last 15 years on this, but now more and more OEMs are doing that. What they're realizing is that young people are voting with their pocketbooks and want to buy greener and greener products.\n\nWe've chased this space vigorously for 15 years, and we continue to chase it. We continue to find great vendors on different continents that can help us recycle our plastic that we create in those continents and then also fulfill the needs of our OEMs.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPaper cups are for the first time part of the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s materials specifications list, the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. Graphic Packaging International praised the cups update, calling it \u201ca major milestone in a broader movement to increase awareness and drive greater collection of paper cups in recycling systems,\u201d according to a Monday news release.\n\nReMa's ISRI specifications set standards for the quality of recycled materials and serve as a guide for scrap material buyers' and sellers' transactions. However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Paper Cups Gain Recycling Status, Opening New Fiber Recovery Avenues\n\n**Key details:**\nPaper cups are now included on the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s (ReMa) materials specifications list, marking the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. ReMa's ISRI specifications establish quality standards for recycled materials, guiding transactions between scrap material buyers and sellers. While influential with waste collectors and material recovery facilities (MRFs), these guidelines do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials. The update followed a suggestion by a ReMa member in September 2024 and received board approval in May after roughly nine months of progression.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nReMa's guidelines are highly influential for waste collectors and MRFs in determining what gets collected in municipal recycling systems. This addition means more high-quality, longer fiber \u2014 which the industry desires \u2014 will be introduced into the available recycling market. The move challenges the previous consensus that paper cup coatings contributed to contamination and made fiber recovery not \"worth the hassle,\" as negative feedback indicated certain mills preferred not to work with them. However, newer packaging designs and technological advances like robots, optical sorters, and modern pulping equipment now make fiber recovery more efficient, overcoming past separation difficulties. This development helps drive demand for cup material and is critical for end market development.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPaper cups have historically posed recycling challenges due to thin plastic coatings, designed to prevent leaks, which comprise approximately 5% of the cup, with the remaining 95% being wood-based fibers. While some mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, this acceptance is growing and becoming less regionalized. Industry fiber recycling rates have appeared flat, and participants actively debate ways to boost them. Graphic Packaging International (GPI) views the inclusion of cups as essential to expand the range of recovered paperboard packaging materials, providing a high-quality, underutilized fiber source that currently often ends up in landfills.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020.\n*   Paper cups are made with approximately 95% wood-based fibers.\n*   GPI's new Waco mill plans to use up to 15 million paper cups per day as feedstock.\n*   More than 40 North American mills (a 33% increase from prior year) accepted single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups as of mid-2024.\n*   Only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams as of mid-2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Recycled Materials Association (ReMa):** Added paper cups to its influential materials specifications list for recycling quality.\n*   **Graphic Packaging International (GPI):** Major recovered fiber user, largest North American paper cup producer, praised the update.\n*   **Mike Doss:** CEO of Graphic Packaging International, emphasized the update's significance for the company.\n*   **Chick-fil-A:** Food service giant that GPI helped develop alternative paper cup solutions for.\n*   **McDonald\u2019s:** Food service giant that GPI helped develop alternative paper cup solutions for.\n*   **Nissin Cup Noodles:** Switched to a fiber cup version with assistance from GPI in the CPG space.\n*   **Bret Biggers:** Senior economist at ReMa, explained the importance of specs and cup fiber quality.\n*   **Foodservice Packaging Institute (FPI):** Heralded for efforts to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling in North America.\n*   **NextGen Consortium:** Partnered on collecting data regarding North American mill acceptance of paper cups.\n*   **Natha Dempsey:** FPI President, explained the association\u2019s demand-pull system for recovery efforts.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Graphic Packaging International is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nReMa approval opens a significant new recycling stream for paper cups, boosting fiber supply.",
