        "summary": "**Headline:** Manufacturing Contracts in July Amid Tariff Woes; Outlook Mixed\n\n**Key details:**\nThe manufacturing industry's contraction accelerated in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) registering 48%. Production rose to 51.4%, but this suggests higher prices due to ongoing tariff concerns. Supplier deliveries were faster in July, and the employment index fell, indicating cautious hiring despite increased production. However, new and backlog orders increased by 47.1% and 46.8% respectively, offering potential positive indications for the future. S&P's July PMI also showed a deterioration in operating conditions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe accelerating manufacturing contraction signals a challenging environment, reinforced by a significant GDP contraction to 79% in July, which is \"quite concerning.\" Tariffs are prompting companies to question sourcing strategies and consider passing higher costs to customers, indicating a broader impact on pricing and supply chains. This situation presents a mixed picture that challenges a purely negative industry consensus, as the increase in new and backlog orders suggests a future rebuild of inventories. Furthermore, U.S. manufacturers now anticipate greater stability from understood tariff conditions, which is considered a \"good thing.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe manufacturing sector is currently navigating persistent tariff concerns, which are causing companies to evaluate sourcing and potential cost increases for consumers. Industry health is measured by PMI, with readings below 50% indicating contraction. Companies previously saw customers stocking up on orders to get ahead of tariffs, leading to a rise in new and backlog orders. This suggests that once inventories are depleted, companies may return to their suppliers to restock. Manufacturers also believe that trade deals made by the Trump administration will contribute to more stable and predictable future conditions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM\u2019s July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index: 48%, down one percentage point from June.\n*   Manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted to 79% in July, from 46% in June.\n*   New orders increased by 47.1% and backlog orders by 46.8%.\n*   Employment index registered 43.4%, down 1.6 percentage points from June\u2019s 45%.\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI reported 49.8%, down from June\u2019s 52.9%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Reported the July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, indicating manufacturing industry contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, discussed tariff impacts on sourcing, costs, and future positive indicators.\n*   **S&P:** Published its July PMI report, reflecting similar numbers and deteriorating operating conditions.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist, commented on declining optimism and employment.\n*   **Trump administration:** Its trade deals are expected to create more stable and predictable conditions for manufacturers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing contracts amid tariffs, with mixed signals for future demand.",

        "title": "Ex-Flagstar CEO accused of illegal conduct",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Ex-Flagstar CEO Accused of Misconduct, Money Laundering in New Lawsuit\n\n**Key details:** A lawsuit filed by former Flagstar chief compliance officer Ross Marrazzo accuses former CEO Alessandro DiNello of significant misconduct. The complaint alleges DiNello was aware of client money laundering and urged Marrazzo to keep a flagged account open, potentially \"tipping\" the client. DiNello also allegedly discussed sensitive company transactions over a virtual conference while a \"junior employee sat on his lap.\" Marrazzo claims he was terminated to block his investigation into these matters.\n\n**Why it matters:** These allegations, brought by a former chief compliance officer, point to serious internal control and ethical failures at New York Community Bank, post-merger with Flagstar. The claims suggest potential executive interference in compliance investigations and a board that reportedly dismissed significant misconduct. This information could challenge any current perception of the bank's internal governance and commitment to regulatory compliance, especially given its recent struggles and acquisitions, by highlighting alleged high-level breaches.\n\n**The big picture:** Ross Marrazzo, a 40-year veteran in regulatory compliance, joined New York Community Bank (NYCB) which merged with Flagstar in 2022. NYCB acquired a large segment of the failed Signature Bank in March 2023. Alessandro DiNello, formerly Flagstar CEO, was installed as NYCB's CEO in March 2024 amidst the bank's financial problems, though his tenure was short. Marrazzo, who previously handled Signature Bank's regulatory issues, headed investigations involving DiNello before his termination.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* $2.7 billion: New York Community Bank bought a large segment of Signature Bank for this amount.\n* March 2023: Date NYCB acquired Signature Bank's segment.\n* $5 million: Amount Alessandro DiNello transferred to a millionaire.\n* $1.7 million: Amount DiNello received back in a related transfer.\n* 36 months: Ross Marrazzo's agreement term with the company.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* Alessandro DiNello: Former Flagstar CEO accused in lawsuit of alleged money laundering awareness and misconduct.\n* Ross Marrazzo: Former enterprise chief compliance officer who filed lawsuit after termination.\n* New York Community Bank (NYCB): Bank where alleged misconduct occurred; merged with Flagstar.\n* Flagstar: Bank whose name was adopted after merger with NYCB.\n* Signature Bank: Failed bank from which NYCB bought a large segment.\n* Joseph Otting: Took over as NYCB CEO after DiNello stepped down.\n* Liberty Capital: Acquired controlling interest in NYCB around time of stock offer.\n* Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom: Law firm involved in video meeting where nonpublic information was discussed.\n* Cravath, Swaine & Moore: Law firm that investigated the video meeting incident for the bank.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Eastern District of New York, will proceed.\n* Ross Marrazzo is seeking employment restoration and financial compensation.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New lawsuit alleges severe misconduct by ex-CEO, raising major compliance and governance flags.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Five Senior FDIC Officials Accused of Widespread Workplace Misconduct\n\n**Key details:**\nA report from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released Thursday found five senior Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) officials, including then-Chair Martin Gruenberg, engaged in workplace misconduct. The OIG's investigations developed evidence that each official personally engaged in some degree of inappropriate conduct. Allegations against Gruenberg included being short-tempered, making people cry, and dismissing a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 as a \"political attack.\" Other officials faced accusations ranging from belittling staff and leaving vitriolic voicemails to sexual harassment and retaliating against employees. As of June, none of the five officials identified in the report still worked at the FDIC.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe report's findings directly challenge the FDIC\u2019s stated core values, including accountability, fairness, and integrity. This information suggests that the actions of these senior officials did not protect victims of harassment, nor did they consistently align with FDIC policies. A previous OIG report also found FDIC employees perceived management was not effective in supporting harassment victims. The documented misconduct, including alleged retaliation and dismissal of internal concerns, could undermine public trust in the agency responsible for deposit insurance.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis OIG report represents the second part of a two-part investigation into the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture. The investigation was initiated following a November 2023 Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 alleging a \u201cboys\u2019 club environment\u201d that alienated women at the agency. The OIG stated that the evidence supported that certain actions of these senior officials did not protect victims of harassment. The previous OIG report also highlighted employee perceptions that management was ineffective in addressing workplace harassment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Five** Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials engaged in workplace misconduct.\n*   **Four** people alleged then-Chair Gruenberg made them cry.\n*   An employee received a **$105,000** payout following a complaint against Official 2.\n*   The OIG's investigation included a technology-assisted review of **280,448** FDIC documents.\n*   The OIG interviewed **69** current and former FDIC employees.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC):** A financial regulator whose senior officials were found to have engaged in workplace misconduct.\n*   **Office of the Inspector General (OIG):** Authored the report detailing widespread workplace misconduct at the FDIC.\n*   **Martin Gruenberg:** Then-Chair of the FDIC, identified for short-tempered behavior and seeing reports as political attacks.\n*   **Official 1:** A deputy chairman accused of belittling staff and driving employees to tears.\n*   **Official 2:** Allegedly left a vitriolic voicemail, leading to an employee complaint and significant payout.\n*   **Official 3:** Subject of detailed allegations concerning sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct in 2022 and 2023.\n*   **Official 4:** Accused of viewing opponents as disloyal and using his position to investigate them.\n*   **Wall Street Journal:** Published a November 2023 expos\u00e9 alleging a \u201cboys\u2019 club environment\u201d at the FDIC.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDamning report details widespread leadership misconduct, challenging FDIC's institutional integrity.",

        "title": "Frost CEO: Lending competition heating up",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Frost Bank Navigates Rising Texas Lending Competition, Eyes M&A Integration Gains\n\n**Key details:** Frost Bank is experiencing stiffer competition for lending activity in its Texas markets, particularly in the commercial real estate sector. Loans lost to other banks due to structure reached the second-highest quarter ever for Frost in the second quarter. This indicates competitors are offering more lenient loan structures, such as longer interest-only periods or terms. Despite this, Frost's average loans for Q2 increased 7.2% year-over-year to $21.1 billion, and losses to pricing dropped by 28%.\n\n**Why it matters:** The intensifying competition, especially in commercial real estate, suggests potential pressure on loan growth and profitability for banks operating in Texas. Frost's CEO Phil Green stated the bank will not make significant changes to its approach to credit structure, indicating a firm stance on credit quality despite aggressive competitor offerings. This challenges any potential consensus that Frost might compromise its lending standards to secure business. Furthermore, Frost perceives recent Texas M&A activity as beneficial, presenting an opportunity to gain customers and bankers from confused integrating entities.\n\n**The big picture:** Texas has become a significant hub for bank expansion and merger-and-acquisition activity, driven by the state's explosive population and business growth. Several regional and super-regional banks are actively acquiring local lenders or deepening their presence in the state. This heightened competition follows a period where many lenders had scaled back on commercial real estate due to past issues. Now, with fewer deals available, more participants are vying for opportunities.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$21.1 billion:** Frost Bank's average loans for the second quarter.\n*   **7.2%:** Year-over-year increase in Frost's average loans for Q2.\n*   **28%:** Drop in Frost Bank's losses to pricing.\n*   **$347.1 million:** Frost's non-interest expenses in Q2, a 9.5% jump.\n*   **$2.7 billion:** Deposits generated by Frost's expansion efforts since 2018.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Phil Green:** Frost Bank CEO, discussed stiff competition and the bank's strategy on the earnings call.\n*   **Dan Geddes:** Frost CFO, noted intensified competition for larger, high-quality loan opportunities.\n*   **Frost Bank:** San Antonio-based lender facing increased competition in Texas while pursuing organic expansion.\n*   **Huntington Bank:** Columbus, Ohio-based regional bank buying Dallas-based Veritex for $1.9 billion.\n*   **Glacier Bank:** Kalispell, Montana-based bank acquiring Mount Pleasant, Texas-based Guaranty Bancorp.\n*   **Prosperity Bancshares:** Houston-based company buying American Bank for $321.5 million.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Frost maintains credit discipline amid lending competition, leveraging M&A for organic growth.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Tech Job Growth Masks Sector Cuts, Broader Weakness Persists\n\n**Key details:**\nTechnology jobs across the economy increased by 54,000 in July, marking the second consecutive month of growth. However, employer postings for tech positions contracted slightly last month. Tech sector employment also saw a contraction of over 10,000 positions. Tech unemployment slightly rose to 2.9% in July from 2.8% the prior month. This occurred while national unemployment also increased to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe July increase in technology roles across the economy contrasts with flagging indicators in the broader U.S. employment market. This report challenges any consensus of steady job growth, as major downward revisions showed prior months' gains were largely nonexistent. It reveals an underlying weakness in the labor market. While tech jobs across the economy grew, the tech sector itself contracted, indicating a less robust picture for tech companies. This suggests the labor market is no longer a \"job-switcher's paradise.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe data comes from a CompTIA analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data published recently. Employers are contending with economic uncertainty and a fluid global trade scenario. Previous months' seemingly steady jobs growth was significantly revised downwards, showing underlying weakness. Despite the overall growth in tech jobs across the economy, several technology providers have been trimming headcount. These recent layoffs are not fully reflected in the current report due to data lag.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   54,000: Technology jobs increased across the economy in July.\n*   2.9%: Tech unemployment rate in July.\n*   4.2%: National unemployment rate in July.\n*   More than 10,000: Tech sector employment contracted by this amount last month.\n*   More than 40%: Of active tech postings were added last month.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CompTIA**: Conducted the analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n*   **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: Source of the employment data analyzed by CompTIA.\n*   **Indeed**: Laura Ullrich, its director of economic research, commented on the market weakness.\n*   **Udemy**: Mischa Fisher, an economist, stated the market is no longer a job-switcher's paradise.\n*   **Microsoft**: Trimmed approximately 15,000 positions in two layoff rounds.\n*   **Intel**: Laid off over 5,000 last month, with plans for more cuts.\n*   **AWS**: Cut hundreds of positions, as reported in July.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Intel plans to cut nearly 25,000 positions by the end of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTech job growth masks sector cuts; broader market weakness persists.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Fluor reports project pauses and profit drops, stock plummets.\n\n**Key details:** Clients are now taking a \"wait-and-see\" approach, pausing projects due to trade policy, cost escalation, and interest rates. This includes project cancellations or extended deferments. Additionally, three older infrastructure jobs continue to hamstring Fluor's earnings. Work tied to energy construction also slowed significantly.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information challenges Fluor's previous report three months ago, which stated clients were \"forging ahead\" with projects despite headwinds; now, \"many are hitting pause.\" The shift in client behavior, coupled with ongoing issues on large infrastructure jobs and slowed energy work, severely impacted Q2 profits. This reversal suggests a deteriorating market environment and operational challenges.\n\n**The big picture:** Three months prior, Fluor reported clients were actively pursuing projects despite trade headwinds. However, client sentiment has since changed, with trade policy discussions significantly impacting their willingness to make long-term investment decisions. The company continues to experience \"pain from projects\" due to design errors, material escalation, and labor challenges on older jobs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Company's stock cratered more than 27% following the news.\n*   Urban Solutions segment profits nosedived from $105 million to $29 million.\n*   Energy Solutions segment profit dropped about 80% to $15 million from $75 million a year ago.\n*   Backlog fell 13% to $28.2 billion from $32.3 billion a year ago.\n*   New awards dropped 43% year-over-year to $1.8 billion for the second quarter.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Fluor:** Engineering and construction company reporting Q2 earnings, seeing client project pauses and profit hits.\n*   **Jim Breuer:** Fluor CEO, discussed client hesitation, project challenges, and long-term opportunities.\n*   **NuScale:** Small modular nuclear reactor company, Fluor saw $3.2 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gains on its investment.\n*   **Baird:** Milwaukee-based financial services company, provided a research note on Fluor's Q2 results.\n*   **Andrew Wittmann:** Senior research analyst at Baird, commented on Fluor's \"tough\" results with \"weak orders, charges and delays.\"\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Client caution, project delays, and legacy issues hit Fluor's earnings.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Andrea Lucas confirmed at EEOC, signaling policy shift for employers.\n\n**Key details:** Andrea Lucas was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to a second term at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Her new term is set to expire on July 1, 2030. Lucas committed to enacting the \"bold civil rights agenda laid forth by President [Donald] Trump,\" emphasizing \"colorblind equality.\" She also stated that the EEOC is not an independent agency and would obey lawful presidential directives.\n\n**Why it matters:** Lucas's confirmation signals a significant shift in the EEOC's enforcement priorities, directly impacting how companies might approach diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The agency under Lucas has already issued documents targeting what it called \"unlawful\" DEI initiatives and moved to abandon litigation for transgender plaintiffs. Her stated position that the EEOC is not independent, and will follow presidential orders, challenges the traditional view of the agency as a neutral, autonomous enforcer of all civil rights laws, potentially altering compliance expectations and litigation risks for employers.\n\n**The big picture:** Lucas previously served as acting chair at the EEOC, despite the agency lacking a quorum due to President Trump's dismissal of two Democratic commissioners. During her confirmation hearing, Democratic lawmakers questioned her about the agency\u2019s independence from the White House. Lucas reversed her prior stance, affirming she would obey lawful directives from the president. The agency has also terminated leases at some field offices and faces at least one lawsuit alleging refusal to enforce federal workplace protections for transgender workers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Term expiration: July 1, 2030\n*   Columbia University settlement: $21 million\n*   EEOC settlement largest in: nearly 20 years\n*   Largest-ever EEOC settlement for victims of antisemitism\n*   Hamas attacks against Israel: Oct. 7, 2023\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Andrea Lucas: Confirmed to second EEOC term, will pursue Trump's civil rights agenda.\n*   U.S. Senate: Confirmed Andrea Lucas for a second term at the EEOC.\n*   U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): Agency where Lucas serves, handles civil rights enforcement.\n*   President Donald Trump: Lucas committed to enacting his civil rights agenda at the EEOC.\n*   Columbia University: Reached $21 million settlement with EEOC over civil rights allegations.\n*   Hamas: Attacks led to civil rights allegations resolved in EEOC settlement.\n*   Democratic lawmakers: Questioned Lucas during hearing about EEOC's independence.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Andrea Lucas's current term at the EEOC expires on July 1, 2030.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New EEOC leadership signals policy shift, impacting corporate employment practices.",

        "title": "Court shuts down bias claim from Christian ERG with biblical conduct requirement",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Appeals Court Sides with Sandia on Employee Group Discrimination Claim\n\n**Key details:** A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision favoring National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC. A Christian employee resource group (ERG) sued Sandia after its sponsorship was revoked. Sandia withdrew support due to the ERG's requirement that leaders attest to a \"Christian statement of faith,\" which conflicted with company policies. The appeals court affirmed the ERG failed to provide sufficient evidence or preserve arguments for its discrimination claims. This ruling stands even after the U.S. Supreme Court's *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, which lowered the standard for showing harm in Title VII cases.\n\n**Why it matters:** This ruling confirms a company's ability to enforce its nondiscrimination policies against employee groups, even when those groups cite religious grounds. It demonstrates that employers may prevail in discrimination lawsuits, even in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The outcome challenges the view that the *Muldrow* decision would automatically lead to an \"influx of discrimination claims\" against employers. Instead, it suggests that plaintiffs still face hurdles in providing sufficient evidence.\n\n**The big picture:** This case originates from a disagreement between a U.S. Department of Energy lab operator and one of its employee resource groups. At issue was the ERG's leadership criteria requiring adherence to a \"Christian statement of faith,\" which the employer deemed discriminatory. The lawsuit focused on religious discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The appeals court's review included considerations of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, which updated the standard for proving harm in discrimination claims.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   *: 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued its holding July 29.\n*   *: Lawsuit alleged discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n*   *: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 decision in *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* was part of the court's analysis.\n*   *: *Muldrow* changed the Title VII standard from \"significant\" harm to \"some\" harm.\n*   *: ERG was an \"improper plaintiff\" for First and Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC:** Lab operator that won the lawsuit against the employee resource group.\n*   **Christians in the Workplace Networking Group:** Employee resource group that sued Sandia over revoked sponsorship.\n*   **U.S. Department of Energy:** Entity for which Sandia operates as a lab operator.\n*   **10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals:** Court that affirmed the lower court's ruling in Sandia's favor.\n*   **U.S. Supreme Court:** Issued the *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, referenced in the case.\n*   **Muldrow:** Plaintiff in a separate Supreme Court case influencing Title VII standards.\n*   **City of St. Louis:** Defendant in the Supreme Court case referenced by the appeals court.\n*   **HR Dive:** Media outlet mentioned for experts' opinions on *Muldrow* ruling.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Companies can enforce non-discrimination policies; lawsuits face high evidence hurdles.",

        "title": "EEOC alleges Mayo Clinic failed to accommodate religious exemption to COVID vaccine",
        "summary": "**Headline:** EEOC Sues Mayo Clinic Over Denied Religious Vaccine Exemption\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Mayo Clinic, alleging it illegally refused a security guard\u2019s religious COVID-19 vaccine exemption request. The guard, an Assemblies of God Church member, sought exemption in late 2021, citing beliefs and offering masking and testing. Mayo Clinic reportedly denied his request and threatened termination if he did not get vaccinated. The hospital declined comment, citing pending litigation.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit highlights that employers are still contending with failure-to-accommodate lawsuits despite less news about vaccine mandates. Such legal actions can result in \"hefty payouts,\" as exemplified by a $12.69 million jury award in a similar case. This challenges any perception that vaccine-related legal risks have subsided, showing ongoing financial and legal exposure for companies. Employers are advised to take religious accommodation requests seriously, especially after a Supreme Court ruling raised the bar for undue hardship claims.\n\n**The big picture:** While vaccine mandate news has significantly decreased, employers continue to face failure-to-accommodate lawsuits, often alleging religious rights violations. The EEOC consistently pursues these cases, having previously sued AG Equipment Co. and a Michigan-based hospital system over similar issues. One such case resulted in a $50,000 settlement. Legal experts warn employers to diligently address religious accommodation requests following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Groff v. DeJoy decision, which impacts employers' undue hardship claims.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Wednesday: Day the lawsuit against Mayo Clinic was filed.\n*   Late 2021: When the security guard submitted his vaccine exemption request.\n*   $50,000: Settlement in an April 2023 EEOC lawsuit against a Michigan hospital system.\n*   $12.69 million: Amount a Michigan jury initially awarded a former Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan employee.\n*   10: Number of workers allegedly fired by AG Equipment Co. in a prior EEOC lawsuit.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Mayo Clinic: Hospital system sued by EEOC for allegedly refusing a security guard's religious vaccine exemption.\n*   U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): Federal agency that filed the lawsuit against Mayo Clinic for alleged religious discrimination.\n*   Andrea Lucas: EEOC Acting Chair who stated employees have a right to reasonable religious accommodations.\n*   AG Equipment Co.: Manufacturer previously sued by EEOC for allegedly firing 10 workers over vaccine exemptions.\n*   Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan: Company that faced a large jury award in a past case involving a denied exemption.\n*   Assemblies of God Church: Religious affiliation of the security guard who sought the vaccine exemption.\n*   Christian Employers Alliance: Former president selected as chief of staff by EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The lawsuit against Mayo Clinic is currently pending litigation.\n*   A prior EEOC case against AG Equipment Co. is still working its way through the courts.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Employers face ongoing legal and financial risks from religious accommodation lawsuits.",

While states are reportedly making progress in promoting evidence-based reading, more effort is needed for all students to become skilled readers. Shayna Levitan, a policy analyst and author, emphasized students' right to learn with effective instructional materials. The report recommends six principles for states to advance equity in literacy development.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe EdTrust report's call for more action, despite reported state progress, challenges any consensus that current initiatives are fully addressing the literacy gap. This implies a continued need for policy shifts and resource allocation in education. For investors, this could signal ongoing demand for education technology or curriculum providers aligned with evolving evidence-based reading frameworks. U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon's focus on literacy further underscores this priority.\n\n**The big picture:**\nRecent disappointing reading proficiency, as measured by exams like the National Assessment of Educational Progress, has led many states to adopt evidence-based reading policies. These policies often include \"science of reading frameworks.\" U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has declared literacy education her No. 1 priority, reinforcing the national focus on improving student reading skills.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Most states had some type of law or policy addressing pre-K-12 literacy initiatives as of March 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **EdTrust:** Nonprofit that released a report on advancing equitable access to high-quality reading instruction.\n*   **Shayna Levitan:** P-12 policy analyst at EdTrust and author of the report on reading proficiency.\n*   **Council of Chief State School Officers:** Reported on the prevalence of state pre-K-12 literacy initiatives as of March 2024.\n*   **Linda McMahon:** U.S. Education Secretary, stated literacy education is her number one priority.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nStates must intensify efforts to achieve universal reading proficiency.",

        "summary": "**Manufacturing Contraction Accelerates Amid Tariff Concerns, Mixed Signals Emerge**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe manufacturing industry\u2019s contraction accelerated in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 48%. Supplier deliveries became faster, while the employment index declined. Despite the overall contraction, production rose, and new and backlog orders increased, which are considered positive future indicators as customers restock due to tariffs.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe accelerated contraction in manufacturing, highlighted by a PMI below 50%, signals ongoing industry challenges. Tariffs are pushing companies to rethink sourcing strategies and consider passing higher costs to customers, which could impact consumer prices. However, the reported increases in new and backlog orders, driven by customers stocking up, suggest a potential rebound in demand for inventories, challenging a purely negative outlook on the sector's immediate future.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTariffs remain a significant concern, leading to a questioning of sourcing strategies and opportunities for reshoring or nearshoring. Companies are also contemplating passing higher duty-related costs onto end customers, though this hasn't been widely observed yet. The manufacturing sector's gross domestic product contracted sharply in July, reaching a level described as \"quite concerning.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM PMI: 48% in July, down 1 percentage point from June.\n*   Production: 51.4%, up 1.1 percentage points from June.\n*   Supplier deliveries index: 49.3% in July, compared to 54.2% in June.\n*   Employment index: 43.4%, down 1.6 percentage points from June\u2019s 45%.\n*   Manufacturing GDP contracted to 79% in July, from 46% in June.\n*   New orders increased by 47.1%; backlog orders increased by 46.8%.\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI report: 49.8%, down from June\u2019s 52.9%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Released the July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index indicating accelerated manufacturing contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, commented on tariffs' impact on sourcing and companies considering cost pass-through.\n*   **S&P:** Published a July PMI report showing similar indicators and deteriorating operating conditions.\n*   **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** Employer of chief business economist Chris Williamson.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** Chief business economist, stated optimism took a knock due to demand and tariff concerns.\n*   **Trump administration:** Made trade deals, seen by U.S. manufacturers as leading to more stable conditions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing contracts, but tariff-driven order increases offer a glimmer of future rebuilding.",

        "title": "Stryker lowers expected tariff impact to $175M",
        "summary": "**Stryker slashes tariff impact, raises forecast on strong demand.**\n\n**Key details:** Stryker now anticipates a reduced $175 million tariff impact in 2025, down from a prior $200 million forecast. This adjustment follows a U.S.-China agreement to significantly reduce levies, though an EU trade deal set a higher tariff rate than initially modeled. The company also raised its full-year organic sales growth forecast to 9.5%-10% and increased adjusted earnings per share expectations by about 20 cents. Furthermore, Stryker provided an update on its Mako 4 robot, which has FDA clearance but is not yet globally launched, with new applications primarily on this system.\n\n**Why it matters:** The updated outlook, including reduced tariff impact and raised sales/earnings forecasts, challenges previous company projections and potentially market expectations for its future performance. This positive shift is driven by continued procedural strength, demand for capital equipment, and successful pandemic-era efficiency initiatives, suggesting robust underlying business health. Stryker\u2019s smaller tariff impact compared to some peers is attributed to its European manufacturing footprint and lesser presence in China.\n\n**The big picture:** Stryker joins several medical device companies, including Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, in reducing expected tariff hits due to new trade agreements. The company's raised financial forecast is supported by strong demand for implants and capital equipment. Margin improvements are also noted, stemming from pricing and manufacturing efficiency initiatives implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stryker recently achieved a milestone of 2 million robotic procedures performed with its Mako system.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $6 billion (11.1% increase year over year)\n*   Net income: $884 million (7.2% increase year over year)\n*   Expected 2025 tariff impact: $175 million (down from $200 million)\n*   New organic sales growth forecast: 9.5% to 10% (from 8.5% to 9.5%)\n*   Mako milestone: 2 million robotic procedures performed.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Stryker:** A medical device company reporting improved financial forecasts and reduced tariff impact expectations.\n*   **Johnson & Johnson:** A medical device firm also mentioned for cutting its expected tariff hit.\n*   **Boston Scientific:** Another medical device firm noted for slashing its expected tariff hit.\n*   **Preston Wells:** Stryker's CFO, who attributed tariff changes to U.S.-China levy reductions and discussed margin improvements.\n*   **Kevin Lobo:** Stryker's CEO, who commented on drivers for the raised forecast and Mako robot rollout status.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Global rollout of the Mako 4 robot.\n*   Full launch of the Mako shoulder surgery application, currently in limited release until next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Stryker's strong performance and tariff relief boost its financial outlook.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** At Home Closes More Stores Post-Bankruptcy Amid Home Goods Slump\n\n**Key details:**\nHome retailer At Home is closing six additional stores, according to a Friday press release from Hilco Consumer-Retail. These new closures span six states, including Illinois and New Jersey. This follows 26 locations previously announced for shuttering in June, with closing sales offering discounts up to 30% off. All sales on goods purchased on or after Friday are final, and At Home gift cards are accepted through August 14.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAt Home's additional store closures highlight the continued struggles in the broader home goods category. The sector experienced a sharp downturn from its COVID-19 pandemic highs, facing months of sales declines. This trend challenges a potential view that the industry's recent \"upswing\" is broadly stabilizing all players. The liquidations demonstrate the severe impact on specific companies as consumers pull back on discretionary spending.\n\n**The big picture:**\nAt Home, which operated around 260 stores in 40 states, filed for bankruptcy in June with about $2 billion in debt. The company attributed its demise to factors including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and tariffs. This debt is part of a larger agreement involving $600 million in debtor-in-possession financing, with $200 million for restructuring. Other companies like Dollar General, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture, and Ikea are focusing on value or store growth amidst the category headwinds.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Six additional At Home stores are closing.\n* 26 At Home locations were announced to shutter in June.\n* Discounts of up to 30% off are offered during closing sales.\n* At Home operated about 260 stores across 40 states when it filed for bankruptcy.\n* The company filed with about $2 billion in debt.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* At Home: Home retailer closing additional stores after filing for bankruptcy in June.\n* Hilco Consumer-Retail: Firm retained to manage specific store closing sales for At Home.\n* Dollar General: Discount retailer that launched new home products in June.\n* Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture: Home furniture company that sought store growth this year.\n* Ikea: Furniture retailer that also sought store growth this year despite industry headwinds.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* At Home gift cards, certificates, and rewards will be accepted through August 14 at closing stores.\n* Store closing sales will continue until all merchandise, fixtures, and equipment are sold.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** At Home's deeper closures underscore ongoing challenges in the home goods sector.",

While the employment index declined, production rose to 51.4%, suggesting a move towards raising prices due to ongoing tariff concerns. Supplier deliveries were faster, implying better supply chain performance amid sluggish demand. The manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted to 79% in July, a level not seen since December 2024. Conversely, new and backlog orders increased, which ISM views as a potential positive indicator for future U.S. manufacturing. S&P\u2019s July PMI also showed contraction at 49.8%, reflecting a \"deterioration in operating conditions.\"\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe overall contraction in manufacturing reported by both ISM and S&P challenges any consensus view of consistent or robust growth in the sector. Despite some positive indicators like increased new orders and production, the decline in employment and the high manufacturing GDP contraction signal underlying vulnerability. Companies considering passing tariff-induced higher costs to end customers suggest potential inflationary pressures for consumers. This creates a mixed and uncertain outlook for investors, as the industry grapples with the impact of tariffs while simultaneously showing signs of future demand.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTariffs are an ongoing concern for the manufacturing industry, prompting companies to question sourcing strategies and consider reshoring or nearshoring. Firms are actively discussing passing higher costs from duties onto their end customers. While supplier deliveries are faster, indicating better supply chain performance, it occurs amidst continued sluggish demand. However, the increase in new and backlog orders suggests customers stocked up due to tariff concerns, with expectations that inventories will now be rebuilt. Additionally, U.S. manufacturers interpret trade deals made by the Trump administration as leading to more stable and predictable future conditions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM PMI in July: 48% (down one percentage point from June).\n*   Manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted in July to 79% (from 46% in June).\n*   New orders increased by 47.1% and backlog orders by 46.8%.\n*   Employment index registered 43.4% (down 1.6 percentage points from June).\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI report: 49.8% (down from June\u2019s 52.9%).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Released its July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, reporting manufacturing industry contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, discussed tariffs' impact on company sourcing, costs, and positive future order indicators.\n*   **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** Published its July PMI report, which reflected a deterioration in operating conditions.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, commented on S&P's findings and manufacturing optimism.\n*   **Trump administration:** Mentioned for trade deals that manufacturers believe will create more stable and predictable conditions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   ISM anticipates people will go back to their supply base to rebuild inventories after working them off, a potential positive for U.S. manufacturing.\n*   U.S. manufacturers expect more stable and predictable conditions from trade deals, despite ongoing tariffs.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing faces tariff headwinds, showing contraction but mixed signals for future demand.",

The list includes levies for countries that match the rates included in a series of trade-related agreements Trump has announced over the last several months. The order also implements a 25% tariff on imports from India that Trump threatened earlier this week.\n\nTariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China will continue to incur separate duties, while goods from countries not listed in the order will face a baseline 10% levy.\n\nThe Trump administration also continues investigations into the semiconductor and pharmaceuticals industries, which are expected to result in sectoral tariffs when complete.

These duties will range from 10% to 41%, including a 25% tariff on India and a 39% rate for Switzerland. Tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China will continue separately, while goods from unlisted countries face a baseline 10% levy. Imports loaded onto vessels or in transit by August 7 will not be subject to the duties if entered for consumption by October 5.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe executive order codifies previously unveiled duties, directly increasing import costs for businesses sourcing from affected countries. This move solidifies President Trump's protectionist trade policy, impacting various global supply chains. The targeted 39% rate on Switzerland highlights specific pressure on the pharmaceutical industry, given its major drugmaking presence. It suggests a challenge to any consensus view that further negotiations or a prolonged pause might have averted these specific, higher tariffs for countries that failed to meet U.S. demands.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPresident Trump's directive implements country-specific duties first announced in April, which were subsequently paused. During this pause, the administration reached tariff agreements with some trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. However, the order states that other countries failed to offer sufficient trade or security commitments or did not engage in negotiations. The new tariffs are described as reciprocal, reflecting these varying outcomes.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 60 trading partners listed for new U.S. tariff rates.\n*   New country-specific tariff rates range from 10% to 41%.\n*   India faces a 25% tariff on imports.\n*   Switzerland is subject to a 39% country-specific rate.\n*   A 40% tariff will apply to goods found transshipped to evade duties.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed the executive order implementing new U.S. country-specific tariff rates.\n*   **U.S. Customs and Border Protection:** Will identify goods transshipped to evade applicable duties.\n*   **Canada:** Continues to incur separate tariffs on imports to the U.S.\n*   **Mexico:** Continues to incur separate tariffs on imports to the U.S.\n*   **China:** Continues to incur separate tariffs on imports to the U.S.\n*   **India:** Faces a newly ordered 25% import tariff from the U.S.\n*   **Switzerland:** Receives a 39% country-specific tariff rate from the U.S.\n*   **European Union:** Reached tariff agreements with the Trump administration during the pause.\n*   **Japan:** Reached tariff agreements with the Trump administration during the pause.\n*   **South Korea:** Reached tariff agreements with the Trump administration during the pause.\n*   **Roche:** Drugmaking giant located in Switzerland, potentially affected by new tariffs.\n*   **Novartis:** Drugmaking giant located in Switzerland, potentially affected by new tariffs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Imports will begin incurring the new country-specific tariffs on August 7.\n*   Investigations into the semiconductor and pharmaceuticals industries are expected to result in future sectoral tariffs.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nU.S. tariff policy is now solidified, raising costs for many global trading partners.",

Kennedy Jr. last month called Wednesday for an alternative to the panel from which they were ousted, arguing that the federal government has \u201cupended the U.S. vaccine policymaking process.\u201d\n\nThe former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which provides vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, made their call in a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cAn alternative to the Committee should be established quickly and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 independently from the federal government,\u201d they wrote.\n\nKennedy, who as head of the Department of Health and Human Serivces oversees the CDC, fired all existing ACIP members in June, replacing them with seven hand-picked successors, some of whom had previously made false claims about vaccines.\n\nHistorically, the committee has met several times per year to review clinical and epidemiological data, assess vaccine benefit and risk, and develop recommendations. The guidelines they put forward, if endorsed by the CDC, can form the basis of insurance coverage and influence health policy. Presentations made at these meetings are typically the product of months of research by working groups.\n\nIn the first meeting of the reformed committee, however, panelists heard from Lyn Redwood, president emeritus of the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense, who gave an unvetted presentation that initially contained at least one incorrect reference.\n\nAt that meeting, committee members sharply questioned evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of certain vaccines, and recommended the contested preservative thimerosal be removed from the few shots that still contain it.\n\n\u201cThe abrupt dismantling of the rigorously vetted process and the replacement of the Committee with an inexperienced and biased panel has engendered fundamental distrust in the Committee\u2019s vital work,\u201d the former ACIP members wrote in their editorial.\n\nThey laid out options for alternatives, including organizing a coalition of professional medical societies that could harmonize their vaccine recommendations or creating an external auditor to review guidelines put out by the reconstituted ACIP. An entirely separate, parallel system that follows past ACIP practices could also be stood up, although they cautioned that would take more resources.\n\nOne initiative, led by University of Minnesota professor Michael Osterholm, who leads an infectious disease center there, is trying something similar.\n\nKennedy has faced pushback for his actions from medical organizations as well as lawmakers. On Tuesday, Democrats on the Senate Health Committee launched an investigation into his remaking of ACIP. Kennedy has also been sued over vaccine policy changes made under his tenure as HHS secretary.\n\nJason Goldman, a liaison member to ACIP and a plaintiff in that suit, said in a recent interview that the changes \u201ccreate tremendous confusion and distrust\u201d in our public health.\n\n\u201cThe [ACIP] process has been hijacked with a very specific agenda to undermine the trust and faith in life-saving vaccines,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nACIP members, as well as other federal vaccine experts, were kept in the dark during Kennedy\u2019s changes to the committee. Stanley Perlman, member of a committee that consults with ACIP and a vaccine advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration, had told BioPharma Dive he heard of the dismissals from the news.\n\nBoth Goldman and Perlman said ACIP working groups did not meet as is typical prior to the most recent ACIP meeting.\n\nACIP isn\u2019t the only health panel that\u2019s been targeted by Kennedy. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal indicated he's considering replacing members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and, on Thursday, Jeremy Faust at Inside Medicine reported Kennedy has fired several members of a committee that supports the CDC director.",

The company received a complete response letter for its bispecific cancer antibody odronextamab in lymphoma on July 30, due to issues at an Indiana factory that Novo Nordisk recently acquired from Catalent. In addition, the FDA will delay a decision on an application for high-dose Eylea processed at that plant. The odronextamab setback will require Regeneron to refile its application. The FDA previously rejected another Regeneron bispecific antibody, now approved as Lynozyfic, in multiple myeloma because of third-party manufacturing issues. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAllogene Therapeutics is stopping use of an experimental immunosuppresive antibody called ALLO-647 following the death of a study participant, the company said Friday. ALLO-647 is part of a regimen meant to prepare patients for treatment with Allogene\u2019s donor-derived cell therapy for blood cancer, cema-cel. But the antibody has been associated in rare cases with severe viral infections and, in this instance, was deemed related to an adenovirus infection that triggered liver failure in a participant in Allogene\u2019s pivotal trial. Allogene has closed the study arm with ALLO-647 and won\u2019t use it in future trials. It will move forward with a standard two-drug immunosuppressive regimen often used in cancer cell therapy. Results from the pivotal trial are still expected next year, the company said. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nBristol Myers Squibb boosted its revenue outlook for 2025 by $700 million, driven by higher-than-expected sales of its off-patent cancer drug Revlimid. The company now expects full-year sales to be between $46.5 and $47.5 billion, although that may not flow through to the bottom line because of the $1.5 billion it has spent this year to license a BioNTech cancer drug. The unexpectedly high $838 million in Revlimid sales in the second quarter were part of a broader overperformance by the company, which beat Wall Street consensus for both its old and new drug business lines. Sales of Eliquis, Opdivo and Reblozyl were higher than expected, although cell therapy Abecma and new psoriasis drug Sotyktu were below, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nBiogen shares rose as much as 7% Thursday after the biotechnology company\u2019s latest earnings report surpassed Wall Street expectations.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Pharma Giants See Mixed Fortunes: Setbacks Amid Surprising Revenue Beats\n\n**Key details:**\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals faced regulatory setbacks for two drugs, odronextamab and high-dose Eylea, due to FDA inspection issues at a third-party manufacturing plant. Allogene Therapeutics halted its experimental antibody ALLO-647 in a study after a participant's death, deemed related to a severe viral infection. Conversely, Bristol Myers Squibb raised its 2025 revenue outlook driven by higher Revlimid sales, beating Wall Street consensus. Biogen's shares rose after its Q2 earnings, including $160 million from Leqembi, surpassed expectations. Argenx also saw shares climb as its autoimmune drug Vyvgart generated nearly $949 million in Q2 sales, handily topping investor estimates.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nRegeneron's recurring manufacturing-related issues may challenge investor expectations for its new drug pipeline's approval timelines. Allogene's safety concern with ALLO-647 impacts its cell therapy regimen, potentially shifting timelines for future trials of cema-cel. Bristol Myers Squibb's increased outlook, even with significant licensing costs, suggests stronger core business performance than analysts anticipated, challenging prior revenue forecasts. Biogen's earnings beat and raised forecasts indicate its business turnaround efforts are gaining traction, potentially challenging skepticism about its future growth. Argenx's \"blowout\" Vyvgart sales demonstrate stronger commercial uptake than the market expected, challenging previous peak sales projections.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a period of mixed developments, as evidenced by recent company announcements. Some firms are navigating persistent regulatory hurdles, particularly regarding manufacturing quality at third-party sites. Simultaneously, other companies are demonstrating robust commercial performance, with several key drugs exceeding sales and earnings expectations. These varied outcomes offer investors insights into the diverse operational challenges and successes across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Bristol Myers Squibb boosted its 2025 revenue outlook by $700 million.\n*   Bristol Myers Squibb expects full-year sales to be between $46.5 billion and $47.5 billion.\n*   Bristol Myers Squibb's second-quarter Revlimid sales were $838 million.\n*   Biogen recorded $2.6 billion in revenue from April through June, with $160 million from Leqembi.\n*   Argenx's Vyvgart formulations generated nearly $949 million in revenue between April and June, beating consensus by over $80 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals:** Experienced regulatory setbacks for two new drugs due to third-party manufacturing issues.\n*   **Allogene Therapeutics:** Stopped use of an experimental antibody (ALLO-647) after a study participant's death.\n*   **Bristol Myers Squibb:** Boosted its 2025 revenue outlook due to higher-than-expected sales of older drugs.\n*   **Biogen:** Shares rose after its latest earnings report surpassed Wall Street's financial expectations.\n*   **Argenx:** Shares climbed significantly after its autoimmune drug Vyvgart's sales handily topped expectations.\n*   **Food and Drug Administration (FDA):** Regulatory body that cited inspection issues impacting Regeneron's drug approvals.\n*   **Novo Nordisk:** Recently acquired a manufacturing plant from Catalent, implicated in Regeneron's regulatory setbacks.\n*   **Catalent:** Previous owner of the Indiana manufacturing plant linked to Regeneron's recent regulatory issues.\n*   **Leerink Partners:** Investment firm with analysts providing commentary on Bristol Myers Squibb and Argenx.\n*   **David Risinger:** Leerink Partners analyst who commented on Bristol Myers Squibb's drug sales performance.\n*   **RBC Capital Markets:** Investment bank with an analyst offering positive commentary on Biogen's results.\n*   **Brian Abrahams:** RBC Capital Markets analyst who sees \"considerable room for upside\" for Biogen.\n*   **William Blair:** Investment firm with an analyst who commented on Argenx's Vyvgart sales performance.\n*   **Myles Minter:** William Blair analyst who characterized Argenx's Vyvgart sales as a \"blowout\" performance.\n*   **Thomas Smith:** Leerink Partners analyst who projected over $9 billion in peak yearly Vyvgart sales.\n*   **Jonathan Gardner:** Author of sections detailing news on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Bristol Myers Squibb.\n*   **Ben Fidler:** Author of sections detailing news on Allogene Therapeutics and Argenx.\n*   **Jacob Bell:** Author of the section detailing news on Biogen.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Regeneron will need to refile its odronextamab application.\n*   Allogene expects results from its pivotal cema-cel trial next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPharma sees mixed results; some beat expectations, others face setbacks.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nSales of an Alnylam Pharmaceuticals rare disease medicine substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations in the drug\u2019s first full quarter since U.S. regulators expanded its use, lifting the biotechnology company\u2019s market value to new highs on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Alnylam, sales of the drug, called Amvuttra and sold for two types of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR, reached $492 million between April and June, well above consensus estimates of about $350 million. About $150 million of that total was attributed to patients with the \u201ccardiomyopathy\u201d form of the disease that regulators cleared Amvuttra for in March. Some 1,400 people were on therapy at the end of the quarter, Alnylam said.\n\nAlnylam also hiked its 2025 financial projections by hundreds of millions of dollars, guiding between $2.18 billion and $2.28 billion in net revenue from Amvuttra and Onpattro, its other transthyretin amyloidosis drug, compared to the previous $1.6 billion to $1.73 billion range. Alnylam now expects $2.65 billion to $2.8 billion in total net revenues. Company shares climbed by more than 15%, taking Alnylam\u2019s market value past $50 billion.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAlnylam has for years been among biotech\u2019s most valuable companies. But it has never been consistently profitable, and is banking on Amvuttra to change that.\n\nA March expansion into ATTR cardiomyopathy, a progressive condition that causes heart failure, hospitalizations and death, was a vital step. ATTR cardiomyopathy is believed to be more common than the \u201cpolyneuropathy\u201d form Amvuttra was first cleared to treat in 2022. Sales of the leading cardiomyopathy treatment, Pfizer\u2019s tafamidis, topped $5 billion last year.\n\nAmvuttra, an injectable medicine, competes with Pfizer\u2019s drug and BridgeBio Pharma\u2019s Attruby, both of which are taken orally. Attruby reached market earlier and is also off to a faster-than-expected start.\n\nAlnylam priced Amvuttra in cardiomyopathy at $476,000 per year, a significant premium to its rivals, despite the fact clinical results didn\u2019t appear strong enough to indicate its drug is clearly superior.\n\nAlnylam executives have said they expect Amvuttra to grow the market for ATTR cardiomyopathy medicines, as most patients still aren\u2019t on treatment. They\u2019ve also expressed confidence Amvuttra could become a standard option. The drug works differently than its competitors and, because it\u2019s only injected four times a year, could have better adherence, they\u2019ve said.\n\nSo far, its optimistic projections appear to be playing out. On a conference call Thursday, some analysts questioned whether the better-than-expected numbers were driven by a surge of initial prescriptions for sicker people whose disease had been progressing on other medicines. CEO Yvonne Greenstreet said the company is seeing \u201cbroad uptake\u201d that includes newly diagnosed patients as well.\n\nChief Commercial Officer Tolga Tanguler added many commercial and Medicare insurers already have policies out and are clearing use in newly diagnosed patients, indicating they aren\u2019t requiring people take Pfizer or BridgeBio\u2019s drugs first. A month into the quarter, Alnylam began to see a \u201cvery healthy and accelerating trend in first-line use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results are \u201cnot just a flash in the pan,\u201d Greenstreet added. \u201cWe expect continuous, sustainable growth,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing the call, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a research note the higher guidance still \u201clooks beatable\u201d and raised his projections for Amvuttra\u2019s peak annual sales to $9 billion, up from about $7 billion previously.\n\nAlnylam intends to gradually lower Amvuttra\u2019s net price through rebates and pay-for-performance deals as patient uptake increases. On Thursday\u2019s call, CFO Jeff Poulton said to expect a \u201cmid-single digit reduction in net price\u201d this year.",

        "date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:58:00 -0400",
        "summary_text": "Biotechnology companies specializing in psychedelics research saw their share prices rise after rumors of a billion-dollar acquisition hinted that big pharma is now more open to betting on this area of drug development.\n\nBloomberg News reported early Thursday that AbbVie is in talks to buy privately held Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals. If agreed to, the deal would hand AbbVie a small slate of experimental therapies for depression, anxiety and mental health conditions. Gilgamesh\u2019s most advanced drug, code-named GM-2505, works by latching onto a brain protein known to interact with psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin.\n\nGilgamesh\u2019s possible takeover appears to have buoyed investor confidence in psychedelics companies. Shares of Cybin, Mind Medicine and GH Research \u2014 which are respectively advancing their own versions of psilocybin, LSD, and a psychoactive compound found in certain plants and toads \u2014 were up about 3% to 5% by mid-morning Thursday.\n\nTwo other biotechs, Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways, had gains of more than 10%, though Compass\u2019 later dwindled.\n\nJoshua Schimmer, an analyst at the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, said he\u2019s not surprised to see big pharma taking more interest in psychedelics, since these therapies have shown \u201ctransformational\u201d potential across a range of mental health disorders. Compass, for one, in June announced results from a late-stage clinical trial wherein a single dose of its psilocybin therapy significantly reduced symptoms of treatment-resistant depression.\n\nGilgamesh also recently disclosed positive results from a study of GM-2505, which, according to the company, was able to quickly, effectively and durably treat the most common form of depression.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important waves of innovation we're seeing today in biotech,\u201d Schimmer said. \u201cWe need more clinical data readouts in proper, large, randomized, controlled trials. But so far, we're seeing things we've really not seen before in psychiatric care, and it doesn't end with depression.\u201d\n\nAnalysts note, too, the inroads psychedelics are making with drug regulators. Martin Makary, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, both support speeding up the testing \u2014 and possible approval \u2014 of psychedelics. The FDA, under former president Joe Biden, also issued guidance in 2023 for psychedelic drug developers.\n\n\u201cThe macro backdrop continues to improve,\u201d wrote Jefferies analyst Andrew Tsai in a note to clients. Tsai added that a Gilgamesh purchase, should it happen under the alleged terms, would be larger than previous deals for these kinds of assets. That could help assure Wall Street that psychedelics are \u201can investable space.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, concerns raised by last year's flame-out of one of the field's leading players, Lykos Therapeutics, have since eased. Analysts now see the problems that company encountered in its attempt to win approval of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as unique.\n\nWhile those tailwinds can help catalyze bigger-ticket acquisitions, there are reasons to believe such deals won\u2019t come easily. For instance, many of the deepest-pocketed drug firms have found neuroscience too risky and backed away from it over the years. That aversion, if it persists, could keep the pool of potential buyers narrow.\n\nPsychedelic developers may also not be so keen to come to the negotiating table, especially since medium-sized companies like Intra-Cellular Therapies, Axsome Therapeutics and Acadia Pharmaceuticals have demonstrated that brain drugs can be successfully commercialized without big pharma resources.\n\nMany of the current crop of psychedelics biotechs have \u201cvery strong management teams\u201d with considerable experience selling medicines, Schimmer said. \u201cI don't see why you need a large pharma company to get this done.\u201d\n\nKabir Nath, CEO of Compass, told BioPharma Dive this week that his team isn\u2019t designing the company to be sold. The focus, rather, is getting Compass\u2019 psilocybin therapy through the final stages of testing and onto the market.\n\n\u201cIt's very exciting to see the resurgence of interest in psychiatry in general, from big pharma and so on,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe can't expect to be bought or partnered.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any board, if somebody comes knocking at the right point, we'll have the discussion,\u201d Nath added. \u201cThe door is not closed.\u201d\n\nAbbVie has been more active than many of its peers inking deals that revolve around the brain. In late 2023, the company agreed to spend almost $9 billion to take control of Cerevel Therapeutics and a once-promising schizophrenia therapy.\n\nSince then it dropped $1.4 billion on a Johnson & Johnson-backed startup built around a type of brain drug technology. Then, a couple months ago, it took a $355 million stake in a biotech developing genetic medicines for neurological disorders, among other diseases.\n\nA Gilgamesh acquisition would further diversify the company\u2019s neuroscience research while thrusting it into a field few other large pharmaceutical firms have felt comfortable dedicating significant resources to. J&J is the main exception there. It already sells Spravato, a form of ketamine that\u2019s used to treat depression and last year generated more than $1 billion.\n\nJ&J also this spring closed its $15 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular, providing access to a lucrative, mind-stabilizing drug called Caplyta as well as a series of experimental, non-hallucinogenic psychedelics.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets, in a report published last week, argued the psychedelic space is \u201capproaching a tipping point\u201d as late-stage readouts near and Spravato gets on track to deliver $2 billion in yearly sales.

The news has boosted investor confidence across the psychedelics biotech sector.\n\n**Why it matters:** This potential acquisition signals that big pharma is becoming more open to investing in psychedelics drug development. It challenges the long-standing aversion many large drug firms have had towards neuroscience due to perceived risks.

The company planned to hit that mark without cutting into its workforce, with a spokesperson at the time calling the restructuring a \u201cfinancial change\u201d that wouldn\u2019t involve layoffs.\n\nIn a Thursday memo to employees, CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that the company has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d towards that goal, in part by renegotiating supply deals and lowering manufacturing costs. But while \u201cevery effort was made to avoid affecting jobs,\u201d the company now has to reduce its headcount, too. Bancel didn\u2019t detail which types of roles will be affected, but revealed the company\u2019s global workforce \u2014 which totaled more than 5,800 people in 18 countries at the end of last year \u2014 will be cut to less than 5,000.\n\n\"Reshaping our operating structure and aligning our cost structure to the realities of our business are essential to remain focused and financially disciplined, while continuing to invest in our science on the path to 2027,\u201d Bancel wrote.\n\nModerna rose to stardom during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing one of the first coronavirus shots to market and earning billions of dollars in product sales as a result. But its financial fortunes have reversed since then due to declining demand for COVID-19 shots and slow uptake for an RSV vaccine it\u2019s also brought to market. Moderna has revised its revenue guidance multiple times amid the slowdown, too, eroding confidence in its management team and leading analysts to long expect expense cuts and layoffs.\n\nThe job cuts announced Thursday are \u201cnecessary to right-size the company\u2019s operational footprint to offset continued vaccine revenue decline,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Mani Foroohar wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe change in U.S. public health leadership this year has hurt Moderna, too. The Food and Drug Administration has implemented a stricter approval framework for COVID shots that\u2019s resulted in narrower-than-expected clearances. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also recast an influential vaccine committee with some members skeptical of the messenger RNA shots Moderna is known for. HHS terminated a contract with Moderna to develop mRNA vaccines for bird flu as well.\n\nModerna is counting on newer shots it\u2019s developing \u2014 among them a cancer vaccine being co-developed with Merck & Co. and a combination COVID and influenza vaccine \u2014 to help change its outlook.\n\n\u201cOur mission remains unchanged. With three approved products and the potential for up to eight more approvals in the next three years, the future of Moderna is bright. We are sharpening our focus, becoming leaner, and staying ambitious in oncology, rare diseases and latent viruses,\u201d Bancel said in the memo.\n\nModerna will report its latest quarterly results on Friday.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s popular diabetes drug Mounjaro proved about as effective as its older medicine Trulicity in protecting heart health in the largest and longest clinical trial of the newer GLP-1 therapy to date.\n\nAccording to summary results released by Lilly Thursday, Mounjaro met the main goal of the head-to-head study, which enrolled more than 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and heart disease and ran for nearly five years.\n\nWhile Mounjaro\u2019s benefit wasn\u2019t great enough for researchers to declare it superior to Trulicity, the rate of all-cause mortality was 16% lower for the newer drug, which in addition to stimulating the GLP-1 hormone receptor like Trulicity, also activates another known as GIP.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTirzepatide, the active ingredient contained in Mounjaro and Zepbound, which Lilly sells for weight loss, has fast become one of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s fast-selling medicines. Already, it\u2019s entrenched as a go-to option for treating Type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\nStudies like the one Lilly top-lined Thursday are meant to build on that dominance by proving out the tantalizing signals indicating tirzepatide can have powerful effects on a range of chronic illnesses. Already, Lilly has shown with Phase 3 trial data that tirzepatide can lower heart failure risk, ease obstructive sleep apnea and reduce the chances of developing diabetes.\n\nThe results released Thursday are particularly vital to Lilly\u2019s plans, given the interplay between diabetes, obesity and heart risk. The company said it would share the data with regulators, potentially supporting its addition to Mounjaro\u2019s labeling, which could help improve insurance coverage and encourage prescribing.\n\nCalled Surpass-CVOT, the trial pitted Mounjaro against Trulicity on an endpoint known as MACE-3, which tracks the time until first occurrence of either a stroke, heart attack or cardiovascular-related death. On that measure, data showed treatment with Mounjaro led to an 8% lower rate than did Trulicity, enough to statistically prove \u201cnon-inferiority\u201d but not superiority.\n\n\u201cAlthough we would have rather seen tirzepatide demonstrate statistically significant superiority on the primary endpoint, we see the results as supportive of tirzepatide continuing to be preferred by physicians and patients over other GLP-1s, including Trulicity,\u201d wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger in a Thursday note to clients.\n\nOther secondary measures also supported Mounjaro\u2019s benefit. Clinical trial participants who received it on average experienced better kidney function and blood sugar control, although Lilly did not adjust the data for testing multiple hypotheses.\n\nPeople on Mounjaro also experienced substantially greater improvements in weight, losing on average about 25 pounds at three years compared to about 10 pounds for those on Trulicity.\n\nLilly also compared data from Surpass-CVOT to an earlier study called Rewind that tested Trulicity against placebo and found the older GLP-1 drug reduced MACE-3 risk by about 12%. By statistically matching patients who received Mounjaro in Surpass-CVOT to those given placebo in Rewind, Lilly researchers estimated Mounjaro\u2019s risk reduction versus placebo at 28% on MACE-3 and 39% on all-cause mortality.\n\nSide effects were mainly gastrointestinal and generally ranged from mild to moderate in severity, Lilly said. However, slightly more participants on Mounjaro, about 13%, discontinued due to side effects than the roughly 10% in the group that received Trulicity.\n\nSurpass-CVOT examined Mounjaro\u2019s heart benefit in people who had diabetes; Lilly has another study, dubbed Surmount-MMO, that\u2019s testing whether Zepbound can reduce broader morbidity and mortality risk in people with obesity and heart disease.\n\nSuccess should help Lilly compete with Novo Nordisk\u2019s competing GLP-1 drug semaglutide, which the Danish drugmaker sells as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. Novo already has proven Wegovy provides heart benefits in people with obesity, which has helped it secure favorable insurance coverage.\n\nBut Zepbound\u2019s greater weight loss benefit appears to be winning out in the market, as Lilly has made gains against Novo. On Wednesday, Novo trimmed down its sales forecasts for the year, citing, among other things, increased competition.",

Tim Walz asking state workers to return to the office for 50% of their workdays.\n\nWalmart and Google have issued similar orders in the past six months, with Google introducing a voluntary exit program for some U.S. teams and tightening return-to-office policies for remote employees living near offices, Fortune reported July 11.\n\nA survey by Cisco found a \u201cclear, global trend toward increased in-office work,\u201d with 72% of respondents\u2019 organizations having mandates for working in the office, according to the company\u2019s 2025 global hybrid work study released in June. Nearly half, or 46%, of respondents said their organization\u2019s hybrid work policy requires more time in the office than prior policies.\n\nIn part, these initiatives have helped drive an increase in office visits, according to data from location analytics software firm Placer.ai. Following a decrease in attendance in May, foot traffic recovered in June, improving 8.3% year over year, but still 27.4% below 2019 levels. June was the fourth busiest in-office month since the pandemic, according to the Placer.ai, which analyzed foot traffic data from about 1,000 U.S. office buildings.\n\nThe increase in attendance was led by Miami and New York, with both nearing full post-pandemic recovery. Atlanta, Dallas and Houston also outperformed the U.S. overall. San Francisco, which remained furthest from pre-pandemic attendance levels, also was making progress toward getting people into the office, Placer.ai says.\n\nHybrid work, collaboration tools remain crucial\n\nDespite the trend, 40% of interactions in the office still have at least one person joining remotely, on average, according to Cisco\u2019s survey.\n\nHybrid work arrangements remain \u201ca cornerstone of the modern workplace,\u201d Cisco says. It notes that 90% or more of employers and employees recognize collaboration technology as crucial to enabling engagement and flexibility, resulting in increasing investments in these technologies.\n\nDespite the availability of collaboration tools, only 49% of employees feel workflows are seamless across all work locations, underscoring the need for better technology devices and capabilities that can provide better employee experience, according to the report.\n\n\u201cAs the future of work continues to evolve, it is essential to invest in flexible and scalable technology that adapts to changing workforce needs,\u201d Amit Barave, vice president of product management for Webex at Cisco, told Facilities Dive in an email. \u201cAt a high level, facilities and IT must prioritize an integrated and seamless experience to ensuring that hardware and software work together harmoniously. This enhances operational efficiency and also provides a cohesive user experience that supports productivity.\u201d\n\nIntegration of the tools is key, Barave said.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, success hinges on understanding the actual workflows and needs of your employees,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore making deployment decisions, take time to understand how teams collaborate, what their pain points are, and how new tools can genuinely enhance their day-to-day.\u201d\n\nAdvanced analytics tools can help leaders assess employee satisfaction and the adoption of collaboration tools and workplace resources, according to Barave. But facility managers must be careful when making decisions around these tools, especially as it relates to the technical support required to maintain them, he said.\n\nFor example, when weighing in-house versus outsourced support for these technologies, operators must critically assess several key aspects, such as the specialized expertise of support teams for hybrid tools; their scalability and flexibility; and robust security and compliance measures.\n\nThey also must ensure there are clear service level agreements in place for response times, and determine whether the support is proactive or merely reactive, Barave said.\n\n\u201cThe user experience for accessing support is critical as well, as it must be intuitive and efficient for employees working from anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better serve organizations and their employees during this transition period, the relationship between facility managers, real estate operators and businesses must take the form of a strategic partnership, according to Barave.\n\n\u201cThe key is regular, proactive conversations focused on understanding each business\u2019s goals \u2014 especially as hybrid work continues to evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cFacilities managers and operators can ask, \u2018What are your priorities for the next 12\u201324 months, and how can our spaces help you achieve them?\u2019 and provide data-driven insights to support better decisions.\u201d\n\nCorporate and commercial real estate operators should also establish clear metrics for success and a feedback loop. By measuring tangible outcomes, like increased productivity and improved employee satisfaction, office operators can validate technology investments, identify areas for adjustment and continue to better align their solutions with evolving business needs, according to Barave.\n\n\u201cSuccess comes from listening closely, adapting together, and always aiming to enhance partners\u2019 business outcomes,\u201d he said.",

Starbucks corporate employees must return four days a week by October, offering a voluntary exit program. Target\u2019s commercial unit employees are asked to return at least three days a week starting September 2. 3M, U.S. Bank, and General Mills also enacted increased office attendance requirements this year.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese mandates are driving an increase in office visits, with June foot traffic up 8.3% year over year. However, the information challenges a view that companies are fully abandoning flexible work, as hybrid arrangements remain common and integral.

        "summary_text": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Madrigal Pharmaceuticals and Viridian Therapeutics, as well as updates from Apellis Pharmaceuticals, PTC Therapeutics and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals that you may have missed.\n\nSeeking to expand treatment of the liver disease MASH, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is paying $120 million to Hong Kong-based drugmaker CSPC Pharmaceutical Group for global rights to an oral GLP-1 drug in preclinical development. The deal offers CSPC potentially $2 billion in additional payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Madrigal executives said they plan on combining the CSPC drug, called SYH2086, with the company\u2019s MASH drug Rezdiffra in a once-daily pill. They envision treatment could combine the benefits of weight loss from a GLP-1 pill with the antifibrotic and fat reducing qualities of Rezdiffra to give people with MASH additional disease control. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nKissei Pharmaceutical is paying $70 million upfront and offering up to $315 million in milestone payments to Viridian Therapeutics for Japanese rights to two antibody drugs for thyroid eye disease. Viridian has already announced positive Phase 3 study data for the most advanced drug in the deal, called veligrotug. The second, called VRDN-003, is in ongoing Phase 3 testing. The company hopes to compete with Amgen\u2019s marketed drug for thyroid eye disease, Tepezza, by offering a more convenient dosing regimen.\u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved broader use of Apellis Pharmaceuticals\u2019 rare disease drug Empaveli, clearing it for the kidney diseases C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in people 12 years of age or older. In testing, treatment with Empaveli reduced urine protein levels by significantly more than placebo and stabilized kidney function. Earlier this year, Novartis won FDA approval of its drug Fabhalta for use in adults with C3G. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nPeople with the rare disease phenylketonuria, or PKU, have a new treatment option after the FDA on Monday approved the drug Sephience from PTC Therapeutics. In a statement, the company highlighted what it described as a broad label that includes all disease subtypes in people who are 1 month of age or older. News of the approval sent shares in PTC higher by nearly 10% this week. The company is also awaiting agency decisions on drugs for Friedrich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals said Monday that it had earned a $100 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics under their research alliance, after meeting a patient enrollment target in a Phase 1/2 trial of its treatment for myotonic muscular dystrophy. Such fees are part of the normal course of business in biotech, but payment by Sarepta had suddenly become in doubt after the company\u2019s standoff with the FDA over whether it could continue selling its gene therapy Elevidys. The Duchenne treatment is vital to Sarepta\u2019s financial future, so the prospect of it being removed from market sparked concerns Sarepta might reach a point when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations. That risk appears to have receded for now, after the FDA relented Tuesday. Arrowhead expects to receive the $100 million within 60 days. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

The FDA approved broader use of Apellis Pharmaceuticals' Empaveli for specific kidney diseases and PTC Therapeutics' Sephience for PKU. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals earned a $100 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics after meeting a myotonic muscular dystrophy trial target.\n\n**Why it matters:** Madrigal's GLP-1 acquisition could alter MASH treatment by combining weight loss with antifibrotic effects, potentially challenging existing approaches. PTC Therapeutics' broad FDA approval for Sephience offers a new, widely applicable option for PKU patients, leading to a significant stock increase. Arrowhead receiving its $100 million payment from Sarepta Therapeutics is crucial. This payment signals Sarepta's ability to meet its financial obligations, easing prior investor concerns stemming from its earlier FDA standoff over Elevidys, which had put the payment in doubt.\n\n**The big picture:** These announcements reflect ongoing innovation and strategic collaborations within the pharmaceutical sector.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nFord Motor Co. has entered into an unsecured $3 billion term loan credit agreement with a group of major lenders, with JPMorgan Chase serving as the administrative agent, according to a July 28 Securities and Exchange Commission filing .\n\nThe automaker has access to the capital through July 28, 2026, and any funds drawn from the facility will mature on Dec. 31, 2028. However, any loan amounts repaid cannot be reborrowed.\n\nAs a condition of the agreement, Ford must maintain a minimum of $4 billion in liquidity, which includes cash, marketable securities, and availability under its other credit facilities, according to the filing.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe unsecured $3 billion loan agreement signals a sign of confidence from Ford\u2019s institutional lenders, which include Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The automaker is not required to put down any company assets as collateral.\n\nIn addition, the loan includes a material adverse change conditions clause. Ford's ability to draw upon the funds is not subject to any adverse change conditions or credit rating triggers, which means that the company can still access the loan even if its financial condition changes or its credit rating is downgraded.\n\nIn May, Morningstar confirmed Ford\u2019s credit rating as BBB (low), citing its conservative financial policy and solid balance sheet over the past few years. Morningstar expects that Ford will remain significantly profitable, but its rating indicates that Ford\u2019s business is still vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\n\nEarlier this month, Ford reported Q2 sales of 612,095 vehicles, a 14.2% year-over-year increase. Truck sales, including F-Series pickups, were up 15.1% from last year.\n\nBut Ford and other automakers face uncertainties in the short term around significant changes in tariffs and trade policies that could impact vehicle sales, increase supply chain costs and erode profits. The current business climate led to Ford, General Motors and Stellantis suspending their full-year guidance in the spring.\n\nIn May, Ford said that tariffs would result in a $2.5 billion decline in gross profit and a $1.5 billion decline in net profit in 2025. While its rival GM expects tariffs to cost between $4 billion and $5 billion this year. Stellantis, however, has since reinstated its previous forecast, although the automaker reported a 13% year-over-year decline in H2 revenue this year.\n\nIn April, a Tariff Impact Analysis report published by the Center for Automotive Research concluded that tariffs will raise costs for all domestic automakers by $107.7 billion in 2025.\n\nBut securing the loan helps ensure that Ford can better withstand any unexpected downturn in its business, including a recession. It also provides the automaker with more flexibility in its medium-term capital planning, which includes investments in electrification to launch new hybrid models.\n\nThe funds can also be used to address a record-high number of recalls in 2025 that extend to over 5 million vehicles since Jan. 1. Two weeks ago, the automaker recalled around 694,000 vehicles for fuel injectors that may crack and leak fuel. It followed a recall of 850K vehicles for low-pressure fuel delivery module failures that have led to engine stalling while driving.\n\nAddressing the high number of recalls and performing the necessary repairs under warranty could be costly for Ford.",

Additionally, Ford faces a record-high number of recalls in 2025, exceeding 5 million vehicles, which may be costly.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$3 billion:** Unsecured term loan credit agreement amount.\n*   **$4 billion:** Minimum liquidity Ford must maintain.\n*   **BBB (low):** Ford's credit rating confirmed by Morningstar in May.\n*   **14.2%:** Year-over-year increase in Ford's Q2 sales of 612,095 vehicles.\n*   **Over 5 million:** Record-high number of Ford recalls in 2025 since January 1.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ford Motor Co.:** Secured a $3 billion unsecured loan to boost flexibility and withstand downturns.\n*   **JPMorgan Chase:** Acted as the administrative agent for Ford's new term loan agreement.\n*   **Barclays:** One of the major institutional lenders providing Ford with the unsecured $3 billion loan.\n*   **Deutsche Bank Securities:** Major institutional lender involved in Ford's recently secured $3 billion credit agreement.\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** An institutional lender that provided capital for Ford's new unsecured loan facility.\n*   **Morgan Stanley:** Participated as an institutional lender in Ford's $3 billion unsecured credit agreement.\n*   **Morningstar:** Confirmed Ford's credit rating, noting profitability but vulnerability to economic conditions.\n*   **General Motors (GM):** Rival automaker that suspended full-year guidance due to the current business climate.\n*   **Stellantis:** Automaker rival that suspended then reinstated its forecast, reporting revenue decline.\n*   **Center for Automotive Research:** Concluded tariffs will raise costs for domestic automakers by $107.7 billion in 2025.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Ford's $3 billion unsecured loan signals confidence, bolstering resilience against future challenges.",

The report stated that the U.S. is \u201coverly reliant\u201d on copper imports, posing a national security risk and necessitating action such as tariffs, according to the order.\n\nAs part of the report, the Commerce Secretary recommended the implementation of additional tariffs to be phased in through 2028, including a 15% tariff on refined copper starting in 2027 and 30% starting in 2028. The order also asks the Commerce Secretary to deliver a report on the state of the domestic copper industry that can help assess whether the additional tariffs on refined copper are needed.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary also recommended the implementation of a 25% domestic sales requirement for copper inputs and scrap, as well as export controls.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFord Motor Co. on Wednesday reported a net loss of $36 million in the second quarter, citing costs associated with a field service action and the cancellation of a battery-electric vehicle program. Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $2.1 billion, which Ford said included $800 million in tariff costs.\n\nThe hit from tariffs significantly helped wipe out the automaker's net profit, marking its first quarterly loss since 2023.\n\nNevertheless, Ford saw strong sales in the quarter: 612,095 vehicles in the U.S., or a 14.2% increase from a year ago. Its electrified-vehicle (including BEVs, plug-in-electric vehicles and hybrids) sales totaled 82,886 during the quarter, up 6.6% from Q2 2024.\n\nFor Q2 2025, Ford reported revenue of $50.2 billion versus $44.14 billion estimated per Bloomberg consensus, up 5% compared to a year ago.\n\nFord posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 versus $0.33 expected, on adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.1 billion vs $1.91 billion estimated.\n\nThe Blue Oval automaker\u2019s estimate for tariff costs for the year rose $500 million to $3 billion, up from $2.5 billion predicted last spring.\n\nThe automaker said it now plans to record full year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, down from its February 2025 projection of between $7 billion and $8.5 billion.\n\nFord\u2019s domestic production accounts for about 80% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., according to GlobalData. Ford\u2019s tariff losses are less than those for other Detroit-based OEMs General Motors and Stellantis, but it must still deal with steep levies on aluminum, steel and copper.\n\nCEO Jim Farley says the company is targeting a $1 billion improvement in material costs as a partial offset to tariff expenses.\n\nAs problematic as tariffs are, additional offsets coming from Trump administration deregulation moves, such as a rollback of emissions standards, which will result in Ford being able to increase sales of its most profitable internal-combustion-engine-powered trucks and SUVs.\n\nCommercial unit and ICE business shine, Model e struggles\n\nThe Ford Pro commercial-vehicle business continues to be a growth area for the automaker, generating $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of 12.3% on $18.8 billion in revenue. Ford Pro\u2019s paid subscriptions grew 24% year-over-year to 757,000. \u201cFord Pro is a unique competitive advantage driving both top- and bottom-line growth while creating new high-margin revenue streams from software and physical services,\u201d says Farley.\n\nRevenues for the Ford Model e business unit, which includes battery-electric vehicles and software, climbed 105% to $2.4 billion, but it is still losing money to the tune of $1.329 billion. The automaker said it expects to lose up to $5.5 billion on its BEV and software business in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford Blue, which represents the automaker\u2019s traditional ICE vehicles, reported $661 million in EBIT.\n\nTariff talk\n\nFarley tells Bloomberg the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a \"meaningful\" cost advantage. Last week, President Trump said the U.S. would lower tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%. The reduced tariffs, lower labor costs and favorable exchange rates \"really advantage their export (business),\" Farley said.\n\nA Kentucky-built Ford Escape could cost $5,000 more than a Japan-made Toyota RAV4, while a Michigan-made Ford Bronco might be undercut by a Toyota 4Runner to the tune of $10,000, Farley added.\n\nFord's finance chief Sherry House said in a post-earnings call with analysts and media the firm had raised its forecast for the cost of tariffs on its business because levies on Mexico and Canada, where it has facilities, have remained higher for longer than expected.\n\n\u201cA Model T moment\u201d\n\nEven with a sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit supporting the purchase of BEVs coming on Sept. 30, Farley teased on the earnings call a mid-August showcase of the company\u2019s BEV manufacturing complex in Kentucky. He says the combination of a low-cost, simpler BEV architecture combined with new, lower-cost manufacturing processes it will lay out is a \u201cModel T moment\u201d \u2013 referring to the landmark transformation in lower-cost.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Ford logs Q2 loss amid tariffs, cuts full-year profit outlook.\n\n**Key details:** Ford Motor Co. reported a $36 million net loss in Q2, its first since 2023, primarily due to tariff costs and a cancelled battery-electric vehicle program. The automaker's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $2.1 billion, including $800 million in tariffs. Despite the loss, Ford's Q2 revenue of $50.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 both exceeded analyst estimates.\n\n**Why it matters:** Ford's net loss marks a significant hit, especially as it's the first since 2023, despite strong sales growth and outperforming revenue and EPS estimates. The substantial impact of tariffs, explicitly cited for wiping out profit and causing a lowered full-year outlook, challenges a previous consensus that may not have fully accounted for escalating trade costs. This indicates that while core operational performance in sales and revenue is robust, external factors like tariffs are heavily influencing profitability and future guidance.\n\n**The big picture:** Tariffs are significantly impacting Ford's profitability, with estimated costs rising to $3 billion for the year. The company is actively seeking $1 billion in material cost improvements to partially offset these expenses. While Ford's tariff losses are less severe than those of General Motors and Stellantis, the levies on materials like aluminum, steel, and copper remain a challenge. Additionally, potential deregulation by the Trump administration could enable Ford to increase sales of more profitable internal-combustion-engine trucks and SUVs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Net loss: $36 million in the second quarter.\n*   Full-year adjusted EBIT projection: $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion.\n*   Tariff costs: $800 million in Q2; estimated $3 billion for the full year.\n*   Q2 Revenue: $50.2 billion, surpassing estimates.\n*   Model e business: Lost $1.329 billion in Q2; expects up to $5.5 billion loss in 2025.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ford Motor Co.:** Reported a Q2 net loss and lowered its full-year earnings outlook due to tariffs.\n*   **Jim Farley:** Ford CEO, discussed tariff impacts, material cost offsets, and the \"Model T moment.\"\n*   **Sherry House:** Ford's finance chief, explained the raised tariff forecast due to sustained levies.\n*   **General Motors:** Detroit-based OEM mentioned as having higher tariff losses than Ford.\n*   **Stellantis:** Detroit-based OEM mentioned as having higher tariff losses than Ford.\n*   **Toyota:** Japanese automaker whose vehicles could gain cost advantages from reduced tariffs.\n*   **President Trump:** U.S. President whose administration's tariff decisions and deregulation were discussed.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A mid-August showcase of Ford's BEV manufacturing complex in Kentucky, teased by CEO Farley.\n*   The sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit for BEV purchases on September 30.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Tariffs are eroding Ford's profits and outlook despite strong sales and segment growth.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA Honda employee may proceed with his lawsuit alleging that the company\u2019s U.S. division violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and state laws when it failed to pay him overtime in the aftermath of the 2021 Kronos outage, a federal judge held July 24.\n\nIn Albert v. Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC , Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. denied Honda\u2019s motions for summary judgment on the question of whether the company excessively delayed compensation for overtime that went unpaid during the outage.\n\nHowever, Sargus granted the company\u2019s motion for summary judgment on a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s Ohio state law claims while holding in abeyance a decision on whether Honda is criminally liable under Ohio law. The case consolidated a series of lawsuits relating to the outage, including one 2022 complaint originally filed in Alabama.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe facts outlined in Albert are notable given the steps Honda said it took during and after the events of the Kronos outage to compensate employees. The company was one of several forced to take emergency actions to address payroll concerns following the incident.\n\nFor example, Honda offered affected employees a $1,000 interest-free loan during the second week of the outage and implemented a new pay method that would compensate nonexempt employees for 40 hours at their regular rate, as well as three hours at their overtime rate, per court documents.\n\nAfter the outage was resolved, Honda began a reconciliation process in which it attempted to reconcile differences between the new pay method and what should have been paid to affected workers. This \u201cinvolved analyzing about three million Kronos time swipes, recovering missing scans, and reviewing call-in and leave-of-absence records,\u201d the court said.\n\nHonda issued approximately 20,000 reconciliation payment statements to employees, including a gross amount of more than $2,000 to the lead plaintiff in Albert. When he disputed the amounts provided for certain weeks of the outage, Honda paid the plaintiff for all hours at all pay codes that he asserted for the disputed weeks, as well as an additional inconvenience payment and attendance bonus.\n\nNonetheless, the plaintiff claimed that Honda did not act in good faith because the company lacked a backup timekeeping system before the incident that would have allowed it to continue to track workers\u2019 hours. He also alleged that Honda\u2019s payment was excessively delayed in violation of the FLSA as well as Ohio\u2019s Prompt Pay Act.\n\nSargus held that Honda failed to show that the lead plaintiff \u201clacks evidence that his overtime payments were delayed for a period longer than reasonably necessary.\u201d He declined to opine on the question of whether the company owed back pay or liquidated damages to the plaintiff.\n\nOther employers affected by the outage settled workers\u2019 lawsuits for millions of dollars in recent years. For instance, food corporation Cargill agreed to a $2.4 million settlement of similar claims in 2023, while health system UMass Memorial Health reached a $1.2 million settlement that same year.\n\nLitigation over the outage also has extended to UKG, the HR vendor and parent company of Kronos. The ransomware attack against UKG that precipitated the outage raised questions about HR vendors\u2019 legal liability during disruptions caused by cybercrime.",

Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. denied Honda\u2019s motions for summary judgment regarding excessively delayed compensation. However, Sargus granted Honda's motion for summary judgment on a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s Ohio state law claims, while holding a decision on criminal liability in abeyance.

Litigation over the outage has also extended to UKG itself.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2021:** Year of the Kronos outage.\n*   **$1,000:** Interest-free loan offered by Honda to affected employees during the outage.\n*   **3 million:** Approximate Kronos time swipes analyzed by Honda during the reconciliation process.\n*   **20,000:** Approximate reconciliation payment statements issued by Honda to employees.\n*   **$2.4 million:** Amount Cargill settled for similar claims in 2023.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC:** Company facing a lawsuit alleging delayed overtime payments after a 2021 system outage.\n*   **Albert:** Lead plaintiff in the lawsuit alleging Honda failed to pay overtime promptly after the Kronos outage.\n*   **Judge Edmund Sargus Jr.:** Federal judge who ruled on Honda's summary judgment motions regarding the overtime lawsuit.\n*   **Kronos:** Workforce management software whose 2021 outage led to payroll issues for affected companies.\n*   **UKG:** HR vendor and parent company of Kronos, also facing litigation over the 2021 ransomware attack.\n*   **Cargill:** Food corporation that settled similar worker lawsuits for $2.4 million in 2023.\n*   **UMass Memorial Health:** Health system that settled similar claims for $1.2 million in 2023.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Honda faces continued legal battle over Kronos outage overtime payments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNissan Motor Co. will shutter its CIVAC Plant in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico in March 2026 as part of its fast-track cost-cutting plan to return to profitability by FY2026, the automaker announced Tuesday.\n\nThe automaker said it will consolidate Mexico vehicle production to its complex in Aguascalientes where it operates two factories. Nissan said its action centralizes its manufacturing and allows it to leverage state-of-the-art equipment to drive production and logistics efficiencies.\n\n\u201cToday, we have made the difficult but necessary decision that will allow us to become more efficient, more competitive, and more sustainable,\u201d CEO Ivan Espinosa said in a statement.\n\nThe CIVAC Plant was Nissan\u2019s first production facility outside Japan and operated continuously for more than 60 years.\n\nThe decision to close a plant in Mexico follows the company\u2019s July 14 announcement to shutter a factory in Oppama, Japan by the end of FY2027.\n\nShrinking its manufacturing footprint is part of Nissan\u2019s strategy to cut costs and boost profits. The company\u2019s goal is to slash its global manufacturing facilities from 17 to 10 by FY2027 and reduce global production from 3.5 million units (excluding China) to 2.5 million units while maintaining 100% plant utilization.\n\nDuring the automaker\u2019s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CFO Jeremie Papin said he was encouraged by the progress of Nissan\u2019s turnaround plan, but added that \u201cthe magnitude of our challenge remains significant.\u201d Nissan projects its plan will lead to 500 billion yen ($3.4 billion) in savings by FY2026.\n\nNissan reported a FY2025 Q1 operating loss of $79.1 billion yen ($530 million), while its net income loss was 115.8 billion yen ($775.6 million).\n\nGlobal retail sales fell 10.1% year over year. Nissan\u2019s North American sales fell 2.4% YoY while sales in China tumbled 27.5% from a year ago, where the automaker faces growing competition.\n\nPapin said tariffs impacted its U.S. sales where the automaker prioritized selling domestically built vehicles.\n\nPapin said the company projects to sell 3.25 million units globally during its current fiscal year, which would translate to a 2.9% YoY decline. He expects a steep sales drop in China where Nissan is forecasting an 18% decline and flat growth in Japan, North America and Europe.\n\nEspinosa said the company recognizes its recovery is a two-year plan that will take time to show results.\n\n\u201cFiscal 2025 is our transition year\u2014the year in which we are taking decisions as we simultaneously execute actions,\u201d he said during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cThese actions are being delivered in structured phases, each with clear milestones and accountability.\u201d",

This decision consolidates vehicle production to the company's Aguascalientes complex. The closure is part of Nissan's fast-track cost-cutting plan to achieve profitability by FY2026. This follows a previous announcement to shutter a factory in Oppama, Japan by FY2027. Nissan aims to reduce global manufacturing facilities from 17 to 10 by FY2027.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nNissan's aggressive plant closures signal a clear strategic shift towards efficiency and profitability over sheer volume. Consolidating production in Mexico aims to leverage state-of-the-art equipment for better production and logistics. This directly addresses the company's significant financial struggles, including substantial operating and net income losses in Q1 FY2025. This strategy challenges the traditional industry focus on expanding production, indicating Nissan's priority is now on a leaner, more profitable operation.\n\n**The big picture:**\nNissan is undergoing a major restructuring to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026. This includes a broader strategy to cut costs and boost profits by shrinking its global manufacturing footprint. The company plans to reduce its worldwide facilities from 17 to 10 and lower global production by 1 million units by FY2027. This aggressive turnaround plan projects 500 billion yen ($3.4 billion) in savings by FY2026. Fiscal Year 2025 is considered a \"transition year\" for executing these strategic decisions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   CIVAC Plant closure: March 2026.\n*   Global manufacturing facilities target: From 17 to 10 by FY2027.\n*   Projected savings: 500 billion yen ($3.4 billion) by FY2026.\n*   FY2025 Q1 operating loss: $530 million.\n*   Global retail sales fell 10.1% year over year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Nissan Motor Co.:** Automaker closing plants and cutting production to achieve profitability by fiscal year 2026.\n*   **Ivan Espinosa:** Nissan CEO stating plant closure is a difficult but necessary step for efficiency and sustainability.\n*   **Jeremie Papin:** Nissan CFO encouraged by turnaround progress, but noted the significant magnitude of challenges.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The CIVAC Plant closure in March 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNissan is aggressively shrinking its global footprint to improve profitability amid declining sales.",

Now, however, that approach is \u201cyielding to a, \u2018I need to act now\u201d mindset, Sankar said in an interview.\n\nAgentic AI checks and balances\n\nAs CFOs seek to navigate economic turmoil and changing business needs, they have continued to mull how AI could best benefit their organizations and members of the finance team.\n\n\u201cMany CFOs are starting to spend a significant chunk of their time looking to\u2026\u2018what is the potential of AI?\u2019\u201d Sankar said. \u201cWhere can I invest in agents today so that I can get the benefits of automation?\u201d\n\nAgentic AI \u2014 tools which are crafted to take over tasks without the input of a human \u2014 have captured a widening amount of finance chiefs\u2019 interest in recent months. Many companies, for that matter, have moved out of the \u201cpilot,\u201d or testing phase of such solutions, in favor of production, with about one-third of organizations stating they have moved to full-scale deployment of such tools, according to a recent KPMG survey.\n\nAs finance chiefs contemplate the integration of tools such as agentic AI, they need to be sure they are considering their long-term impact, especially as for some, the end goal of such tools is to have agentic AI performing tasks without human interaction, Sankar said.\n\n\u201cHow can I provide a certain level of checks and balances to ensure that it is doing the right thing and that the numbers coming out of a task performed by agentic AI are as reliable as the numbers performed by my accountant, who's been doing this for 10 years?\u201d he said.\n\nFinance chiefs are looking to find the right place for agentic AI solutions as spending on such tools continues to ramp up: according to a recent study by Big Four firm Ernst & Young, 35% of leaders anticipate their organizations will spend more than $10 million on such technologies in the next year, EY found. Nearly three-quarters of senior leaders also believe entire business units will be managed by agentic AI, according to the study.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say agentic AI tools will entirely replace humans: \u201cI don't think CFOs are in a hurry to get rid of their people, and replace them with agents,\u201d Sankar said, noting the more complex tasks and analysis will always have a human in the loop.\n\nBut, as the business grows, executives may not be meeting that growth with more headcount, because \u201cthese technologies have the potential to deliver a level of automation where you can do more with the existing people,\u201d he said.\n\nAchieving the accounting, tech skill balance\n\nAI\u2019s continued evolution is occurring at the same time as the role of the CFO continues to change, with CEOs leaning more and more heavily on their finance chiefs to drive strategy as well as keep the finance function running smoothly. The broadening of the finance chief role is \u201creflecting in their desire to make investments, their desire to sponsor projects, their desire to hire the right talent or train the existing talent, to become more AI savvy, to become more data savvy,\u201d Sankar said.\n\nIt\u2019s also contributing to a ripple effect throughout the finance department \u2014 controllers, for instance, are gaining responsibility not just for providing the numbers, but \u201cresponsibility to provide clean, consolidated, curated data to the rest of the business,\u201d Sankar said. The financial planning and analysis team, meanwhile, is morphing into a group responsible for supporting \u201cagile decision-making\u201d throughout the organization.\n\nAs the finance function sees its roles and responsibilities continue to evolve, it will be critical to ensure members of the team have the right mix of both core accounting and finance as well as technical skills. Future financial professionals may not need to become data scientists or AI model experts, Sankar said, but they need to develop a \u201csufficient understanding of the technology\u201d so they can properly utilize it to meet the changing needs of their role.\n\n\u201cThere'll be a balance between accounting domain knowledge and broader business knowledge and technical savvy,\u201d Sankar said of how finance functions in the future will be structured.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nGlobal shipping and mailing company Pitney Bowes appointed board director Paul Evans to become CFO, EVP and treasurer, effective July 29, according to a Wednesday release. Evans, who steps down from the board to take the finance reins, succeeds Robert Gold, who is departing just about five months after his appointment was announced in February, according to a company release at the time.\n\nappointed board director Paul Evans Robert Gold, who is departing Evans, 57, has served as a member of the board since October 2024 and as a managing member at FSS Capital, an advisory firm that provides managed capital to startup ventures, since 2021, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He previously also served as COO and director of America\u2019s Auto Auction Group, an automotive remarketing entity, from January 2023 to October 2023. His past experience also includes a stint in 2020 and 2021 as CFO of Sevan Multi-Site Solutions, a private-equity-backed provider of construction services, and he also previously held multiple roles including CAO at MYR Group, a public holding company.\n\nA company spokesperson on Friday declined to comment as to the reasons for the swift change in finance leadership, pointing to CEO Kurt Wolf\u2019s comments during the company\u2019s earnings call this week. \u201cWith respect to the CFO position, this in no way \u2014 the change in no way reflected on Bob. He's an excellent CFO. Just \u2014 it's not often that I feel like we have an opportunity to bring in a talent like Paul,\u201d Wolf said, noting that he had a \u201ctremendous working relationship\u201d with and the same values as Evans. \u201cWe have the same focus within running a business in terms of creating urgency, creating discipline, data-driven decision-making, et cetera. So it was just \u2014 it's really a comment on the opportunity that we had to bring somebody of Paul's caliber.\u201d \u200b\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe shift is the latest in a series of C-suite changes that the Stamford, Connecticut-based company has undergone recently. Last March, then-CFO Ana Maria Chadwick resigned after about three years in the role, in the wake of the company naming Jason Dies to fill in as interim CEO in October for outgoing Marc Lautenbach, CFO Dive previously reported. Chadwick subsequently took the CFO seat at the Acton, Massachusetts-based medical device maker Insulet.\n\nWolf, then a sitting director of Pitney Bowes, was named CEO in May, succeeding Lance Rosenzweig, who stepped down just seven months after being named CEO. The founder of Hestia Capital Management, Wolf is an \u201cactivist investor\u201d that along with three other nominees from Hestia joined the board in 2023 after a proxy battle, according to a May 22 report from Hartford Business. In a letter to shareholders shared in the company\u2019s Wednesday\u2019s earnings release, Wolf said he served with Evans on the board of directors of GameStop in 2020 and 2021.\n\nEvans \u201chas a proven record of helping businesses successfully allocate capital, manage their balance sheets and pursue enhanced profitability. When Paul and I served together on the board of directors of GameStop in 2020 and 2021, we worked side-by-side to help recapitalize the balance sheet, eliminate debt and enhance shareholder value,\u201d the letter states. Videogame retailer GameStop has been viewed as a so-called \u201cmeme stock,\u201d with its shares rising nearly 700% in a few weeks in early 2021 but it has been missing from the latest surge in such trading, Barron\u2019s reported.\n\nThe over 100-year-old Pitney Bowes has faced headwinds as it has sought in recent years to expand beyond its iconic postage meter and mailing equipment roots into parcel and e-commerce shipping, CFO Dive previously reported. In its second quarter, the company\u2019s revenue ticked down to $462 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year, but the company\u2019s GAAP net income improved, hitting $29.9 million, compared to a $24.9 million loss in the year-earlier period, the company reported this week.\n\nUnder the terms of his employment letter, Evans will receive an annual base salary of $600,000, less certain withholdings and payroll deductions, an annual incentive award with a target value of 80% of his annual salary and an annual long-term equity base incentive award with a target grant date value of $1.5 million, according to the SEC filing.",

The company now projects $16 in adjusted earnings per share between $445.5 billion and $448 billion in revenue.\n\nIn the second quarter, the firm reported $111.6 billion in revenue, up 13% year over year, while profit declined 19% to $3.4 billion.\n\nAs CFO, DeVeydt will receive an annual base salary of $1 million, according to a securities filing. He will also receive a sign-on bonus of $1.2 million, as well as a stock sign-on award with a fair value of $5 million, according to the filing.",

        "summary": "**UnitedHealth replaces CFO amid turnaround efforts and mounting challenges**\n\n**Key details:** Wayne DeVeydt, most recently a managing director and operating partner at investment firm Bain Capital, will become UnitedHealth's new CFO on September 2. He replaces John Rex, who has served as CFO since 2016 and will transition to a strategic advisor role for CEO Stephen Hemsley. DeVeydt previously served as chairman and CEO of Surgery Partners and worked at insurer Anthem and consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers. His compensation package includes a $1 million annual base salary, a $1.2 million sign-on bonus, and a stock sign-on award with a fair value of $5 million.\n\n**Why it matters:** This CFO change marks another significant executive shakeup for UnitedHealth as it attempts a financial turnaround. The company faces growing scrutiny over its business practices and is under federal investigation from the Department of Justice over its Medicare program. UnitedHealth recently missed investor expectations for its first-quarter results, pulled its 2025 guidance, and saw its stock fall about 50% this year, leading to downgrades by investment banks. These ongoing leadership changes underscore the company's severe operational and financial pressures, challenging any prevailing view of corporate stability.\n\n**The big picture:** This shakeup comes months after Stephen Hemsley, chairman of UnitedHealth\u2019s board, replaced Andrew Witty as chief executive in May. John Rex had joined UnitedHealth in 2012 as CFO of its Optum health services business before becoming the company's CFO. UnitedHealth includes the nation\u2019s largest insurer, a major pharmacy benefit manager, and a large network of physicians. Scrutiny over the company's business practices reportedly increased after the head of its health insurance unit was killed in December.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Incoming CFO Wayne DeVeydt starts Sept. 2.\n*   UnitedHealth stock is trading about 50% less than at the start of the year.\n*   Q2 revenue: $111.6 billion, up 13% year over year.\n*   Q2 profit: $3.4 billion, declined 19%.\n*   New 2024 guidance: adjusted EPS $16, revenue $445.5 billion to $448 billion.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **UnitedHealth:** Healthcare behemoth replacing its CFO amidst financial turnaround efforts.\n*   **Wayne DeVeydt:** Incoming CFO for UnitedHealth starting Sept. 2, previously at Bain Capital.\n*   **Bain Capital:** Investment firm where incoming CFO Wayne DeVeydt was a managing director.\n*   **John Rex:** Outgoing UnitedHealth CFO since 2016, becoming strategic advisor to CEO.\n*   **Stephen Hemsley:** UnitedHealth CEO who returned to his top job in May.\n*   **Department of Justice:** Federal agency investigating UnitedHealth's Medicare program.\n*   **Andrew Witty:** Previous UnitedHealth CEO, replaced by Stephen Hemsley in May.\n*   **Optum:** UnitedHealth's health services business where John Rex was CFO.\n*   **Surgery Partners:** Surgical facility operator where Wayne DeVeydt served as chairman and CEO.\n*   **Anthem (now Elevance):** Insurer where incoming CFO Wayne DeVeydt previously worked.\n*   **PricewaterhouseCoopers:** Consultancy where incoming CFO Wayne DeVeydt previously worked.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Wayne DeVeydt begins as UnitedHealth's new CFO on September 2.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** UnitedHealth's leadership shuffle underscores ongoing struggles and turnaround efforts.",

The company's ability to balance heavy AI investment with margin expansion demonstrates efficient scaling into FY26. This performance challenges earlier expectations of slower capex growth and confirmed pullbacks in AI data center projects, suggesting strong demand justifies continued heavy investment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMicrosoft reported total revenues of $281.7 billion for its last fiscal year, marking a 15% year-over-year increase. Tech giants like Microsoft continue to heavily invest in AI, with investors keenly seeking evidence of these investments paying off. Earlier, the company's capex was slightly lower than expected due to timing of data center lease deliveries. Economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff measures has also added pressure on big tech firms.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Current quarter capex expected to exceed $30 billion.\n*   Total revenues for last fiscal year: $281.7 billion.\n*   Last fiscal year revenue spike: 15% year-over-year.\n*   Microsoft's stock jumped 5%, pushing valuation beyond $4 trillion.\n*   Capex for most recent quarter: $24.2 billion.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Microsoft:** Software giant reporting strong demand for cloud/AI, driving high capital expenditures and valuation.\n*   **Amy Hood:** Microsoft CFO who provided financial expectations for capex, revenue, and operating income growth.\n*   **Nvidia:** Chipmaker mentioned as also having reached a $4 trillion valuation earlier in July.\n*   **Thomas Monteiro:** Senior analyst at Investing.com, who commented on Microsoft's AI investment and scaling efficiency.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** His tariff measures created economic uncertainty, adding pressure for big tech firms.\n*   **CNBC:** Reported on Microsoft's stock price jump and its valuation exceeding $4 trillion.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Monitoring actual capital expenditures for the current quarter against the $30 billion expectation.\n*   Watching for confirmation of double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the current fiscal year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRobust AI demand justifies Microsoft's massive investments, driving record valuation.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nNearly one in four (23%) CFOs anticipate their treasury departments will accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method, or purchase such assets as investments, within the next two years, according to a recent survey by Big Four firm Deloitte found. That percentage jumps to 39% of finance chiefs at companies with revenues at $10 billion or higher, the Q2 2025 North American Signals survey found.\n\nFinance chiefs are eyeing stablecoins in particular \u2014 digital assets with their valuation tied to that of another asset, typically a fiat currency \u2014 as \u201ca practical entry point\u201d into adoption of digital assets, according to a Thursday press release on the survey results. Only 1% of the 200 finance chiefs surveyed don\u2019t expect to utilize stablecoin over the long-term, according to the survey.\n\n\u201cCFOs are thinking beyond any 'crypto hype' and focusing on the practical implications of digital assets,\" Steve Gallucci, U.S. and global leader of Deloitte's CFO Program, said in a statement included in the release. \"They appear to be assessing where cryptocurrency can drive efficiency, reduce friction in global operations and future-proof financial infrastructure. The opportunity isn't just about innovation; it's about making informed, strategic moves that align with enterprise value and control.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nStablecoins have gained increased attention from business and executive leaders during the past year, as the Trump administration takes steps to bring cryptocurrency and digital assets into mainstream finance. In recent weeks, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a regulation which establishes guidelines for issuers of stablecoins.\n\nThe passing of the GENIUS Act helps to add a much-needed level of legitimacy to stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies for finance chiefs, experts previously told CFO Dive, with CFOs taking a closer look at how such assets could be put to best use inside of their businesses.\n\nStablecoins could enable faster and less costly cross-border payments, for example, with 39% of CFOs citing more efficient cross-border payments as a \u201ctop motivator\u201d for the adoption of such assets, Deloitte found. Forty-five percent of finance chiefs also pointed to greater customer privacy as a key motivator for stablecoin adoption, according to the survey.\n\nAs interest in stablecoin grows, finance chiefs are also broaching the topic with other senior leadership. Over a third (37%) of finance chiefs have had conversations with their boards about cryptocurrency, Deloitte\u2019s survey found, while 41% have had such discussions with their chief information officers.\n\nHowever, \u201cthese early conversations might underscore a recognition that any move toward adoption will likely require a robust governance framework and hefty IT support,\u201d according to the survey.\n\nAlthough the GENIUS Act helped to establish clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance, questions regarding cryptocurrency accounting and compliance still linger for CFOs.\n\nLawmakers, for instance, are considering the age-old question of which digital assets might count as securities, and which government bodies have the power to regulate those assets. In recent votes, the House of Representatives passed both the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, or CLARITY Act, as well as the Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, aimed at addressing those gaps.\n\nThe CLARITY Act, sponsored by Rep. French Hill (R-AR), seeks to establish a framework for digital commodities, and looks to provide jurisdiction to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate digital commodities transactions, according to a summary of the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, in a 166-page report issued Wednesday, the cryptocurrency Presidential Working Group established by President Trump in January recommended that lawmakers \u201cbuild on the massive bipartisan House of Representatives vote for CLARITY\u201d by enacting legislation that \u201celiminates existing gaps in regulatory oversight by providing the CFTC authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets,\u201d according to a fact sheet.\n\nAmong other recommendations, the working group\u2019s report also lays out a plan of action for the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, noting the two agencies should utilize their authority to help enable digital asset trading at the federal level.\n\n\u201cAt its core, the PWG report reflects a conviction that I have long held: a rational regulatory framework for digital assets is the best way to catalyze American innovation, protect investors from fraud and keep our capital markets the envy of the world,\u201d SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement on the report released Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, my predecessor and the previous administration did not share that vision. Thank goodness President Trump does and is leading on it.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** CFOs increasingly embrace stablecoins as regulations foster mainstream crypto adoption.\n\n**Key details:**\nA recent Deloitte survey indicates nearly one in four (23%) CFOs expect their treasury departments to accept cryptocurrencies or invest in them within the next two years. This figure rises to 39% for finance chiefs at companies with revenues of $10 billion or higher. CFOs specifically view stablecoins as a practical entry point into digital assets, with only 1% not anticipating their long-term use. Key motivators for stablecoin adoption include more efficient cross-border payments (39% of CFOs) and greater customer privacy (45% of finance chiefs).\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis growing corporate interest signals a significant shift towards the mainstream adoption of digital assets, moving beyond initial \"crypto hype\" to focus on practical applications. The explicit embrace of stablecoins, supported by new regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act, suggests a pathway for regulated integration into corporate finance. This challenges a potential consensus view that cryptocurrencies are too volatile or unregulated for serious consideration by corporate treasuries, indicating a shift towards strategic exploration. CFOs are also actively engaging senior leadership, including boards and CIOs, in these discussions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Trump administration is actively working to integrate cryptocurrency and digital assets into mainstream finance. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing guidelines for stablecoin issuers and adding legitimacy for finance chiefs. The House of Representatives has also passed relevant legislation, including the CLARITY Act, which seeks to provide a framework for digital commodities and grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulatory jurisdiction. A Cryptocurrency Presidential Working Group also recommended further legislation to address regulatory oversight gaps and enable federal digital asset trading.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   23%: CFOs anticipating crypto acceptance/investment within two years.\n*   39%: CFOs at companies with revenues $10 billion+ anticipating crypto acceptance/investment.\n*   1%: CFOs not expecting to utilize stablecoin over the long-term.\n*   39%: CFOs citing more efficient cross-border payments as a top motivator for stablecoin adoption.\n*   45%: Finance chiefs pointing to greater customer privacy as a key motivator for stablecoin adoption.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Deloitte:** Big Four firm that conducted the Q2 2025 North American Signals survey on CFOs and digital assets.\n*   **Steve Gallucci:** U.S. and global leader of Deloitte's CFO Program, stated CFOs are focusing on practical implications of digital assets.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed the GENIUS Act into law and established the cryptocurrency Presidential Working Group.\n*   **Rep.

The dissenting Fed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, supported policy easing in speeches earlier this month, citing signs of weakness in the job market.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell disagreed with his two colleagues. \u201cLabor market conditions have remained solid\u201d while inflation \u201cremains somewhat elevated relative to our 2% long-run goal,\u201d he said during a post-meeting news conference. \u201cThe economy is not performing as if a restrictive policy is holding it back,\u201d he said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe mix of a cooling labor market and stubborn, above-target inflation poses a dilemma for the central bank, which is mandated by Congress to ensure both price stability and full employment.\n\nPowell and most of his colleagues this year have supported a wait-and-see strategy before trimming the benchmark rate, warning that high import duties may spur a sustained, rather than temporary, jump in prices.\n\nYet such patience disregards signs of job market weakness, and may prompt an unnecessary rise in unemployment, according to Waller and Bowman.\n\nJob openings fell in June compared with May and the hiring rate fell to 3.3%, one of the lowest levels since 2013, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday.\n\nAlso, the proportion of consumers that consider jobs hard to find rose this month to 18.9% from 14.5% in January, the Conference Board said Tuesday.\n\nYet Powell considers the labor market healthy.\n\n\u201cBy many, many statistics, the labor market is kind of still in balance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings like quits, job openings and let alone the unemployment rate, they\u2019re all by many measures very similar to where they were a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you do not see weakening in the labor market.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate for many months has stayed close to its current 4.1% level and the labor market has become balanced as both supply and demand for workers have simultaneously fallen, Powell said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s getting into balance due to declines in both supply and demand, though, is suggestive of downside risks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo of course we\u2019ll be watching that carefully.\u201d\n\nFlagging economic growth may signal a risk from postponing a reduction in borrowing costs.\n\nGross domestic product shrunk at a 0.5% annual rate during the first quarter and then rose 3% during the second quarter, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Wednesday.\n\nHigher import duties under the Trump administration skewed both GDP numbers, with a Q1 overstocking of imported goods to front-run tariffs offset by a decline in imports during Q2.\n\nThe result: 1.2% annual GDP growth during the first six months of this year, less than half the 2.8% rate for all of 2024.\n\nAt the same time, price pressures argue for continuing to pursue a slightly restrictive monetary policy, Powell said.\n\nThe consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annual rate in June compared with 2.4% the prior month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cWe want inflation to move all the way back to its target\u201d of 2%, Powell said, adding that policymakers aim to ensure tariffs do not provoke more than a one-time jolt to prices.\n\n\u201cWe want to do that efficiently, though,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you move too soon, you wind up not getting inflation all the way fixed and you have to come back\u201d with an interest rate increase, Powell said. \u201cIf you move too late, you might do unnecessary damage to the labor market.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated with comments from a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",

The company\u2019s core loss per share of $1.24 was \u201ca significant improvement compared to last year,\u201d CFO Brian West said Tuesday during the company\u2019s earnings call, citing higher commercial deliveries as well as improved operational performance as key drivers.\n\nThe Arlington, Virginia-based company\u2019s latest earnings come several weeks after Boeing announced it would be appointing Lockheed Martin veteran Jay Malave as its CFO, effective Aug. 15, CFO Dive previously reported. West is set to transition to the role of senior advisor also as of Aug. 15.\n\n\u201cI also want to extend my deep appreciation of Brian West for his outstanding work over the last four years to stabilize our business and navigate the recovery, all while continuing to position the company for our future,\u201d President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said Tuesday during the company\u2019s second quarter earnings call. \u201cI look forward to welcoming Jay to Boeing and Brian's continued counsel in his new role.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs CFO, Malave is set to receive an annual base salary of $1.05 million, as well as a cash award of $1.5 million, according to a July 3 securities filing. He will also be eligible to receive an annual bonus with a target value of 120% of his base salary, and beginning in 2026 will be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards with a target value of $6.5 million, per the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn \u201clight of his recent employment\u201d with Lockheed Martin, Malave has also agreed to certain conditions related to his appointment as Boeing\u2019s finance chief, including not participating in the Boeing Defense, Space & Security business until the end of the year, according to the filing. Boeing has also agreed to pay Lockheed $2 million \u201cin connection with a release of claims relating to Mr. Malave\u2019s employment with the Company.\u201d\n\nMalave, who served as Lockheed Martin\u2019s finance chief for three years before departing this past April, is poised to take the financial reins at the jet maker as Boeing seeks to execute on a turnaround plan aimed at regaining profitability and repairing both consumer and regulatory trust in its business.\n\nThe company narrowed its net loss for the quarter ended June 30 to $612 million compared to $1.43 billion for the prior year period. Revenue, meanwhile, spiked 35% to hit $22.7 billion for the quarter. The jet maker also narrowed its cash burn to $200 million for its Q2, compared to $4.3 billion for the prior year period \u2014 an improvement CFO West also attributed to higher commercial deliveries and working capital.\n\nThe jet maker is still facing a number of challenges, however, including continued scrutiny from regulators following several plane crashes and incidents in recent years.\n\nThe company remains under a production cap for its 737 aircraft, imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration following a January 2024 incident where a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines flight. In June, the FAA found that Boeing failed to provide adequate training and oversight for its manufacturing operations, which led to the incident.\n\nBoeing remains on track to request approval from the FAA to expand production of its 737 aircrafts to 42 per month from the current 38 per month cap, CEO Ortberg said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn 737, you'll recall our plan was to methodically ramp up to 38 per month, stabilize at that rate and then request an approval from the FAA for the next rate increase to 42 aircraft a month,\u201d he said in response to questions. For its Q2, Boeing delivered 150 commercial jets, and achieved its rate of 38 737 planes per month, and is \u201cnow focused on demonstrating stability at that rate.\n\nWe'll continue to use key performance indicators that have been agreed to with the FAA to measure the health of the production system,\u201d Ortberg said, noting Boeing \u201cexpects to be in a position\u201d to request approval to increase the cap to 42 planes in the company months.\n\nOrtberg also downplayed the risk of a possible strike of approximately 3,200 employees in the company\u2019s fighter and munitions facilities in St. Louis and St. Charles, noting the \u201cthe order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,\u201d when about 30,000 machinists went on strike.\n\n\u201cWe'll manage through this,\u201d Ortberg said of the impending strike. \u201cI wouldn't worry too much about the implications of the strike. We'll manage our way through that.\u201d",

Net loss for the quarter ended June 30 narrowed to $612 million, compared to $1.43 billion in the prior year period. Cash burn also narrowed to $200 million from $4.3 billion in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe significant narrowing of Boeing's net loss and cash burn, coupled with a substantial revenue increase, signals progress in its financial recovery. These financial improvements, as the company seeks to regain profitability, could challenge a consensus view that Boeing remains mired in deep financial struggles.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\n3 Big Numbers is a weekly column that looks at a few key details from around the c-store industry.\n\nEarlier this week, we looked back at the most impactful c-store M&A deals so far this year. Today, we\u2019re looking at the M&A landscape more broadly as businesses buckle up for the second half.\n\nTariffs have been looming, but experts are almost evenly split on whether they will have an impact on acquisition activity, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. So where do we stand?\n\nIn this week\u2019s \u201c3 Big Numbers,\u201d we look at how M&A is shaking out in 2025.\n\n20% The increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, strategic retail M&A, which includes corporate deals and add-ons, was up 20% through the first five months of the year, according to Bain & Company\u2019s midyear M&A report. And Bain thinks we\u2019ll see more deals this year.\n\n\u201cWe expect consolidation deals will continue to define the M&A market throughout 2025,\u201d Bain said in the report.\n\nBain noted that some of the companies that came through the 2008 financial crisis the strongest were those that used the downturn to strengthen and expand their businesses. That means today\u2019s uncertainty could be an opportunity for well-capitalized companies.\n\n35.7% The decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n\nWhile retail dealmaking has grown, c-stores have been notably more cautious. In fact, convenience store and fuel distribution M&A activity decreased 35.7% year-over-year through mid-May, reaching just nine announced deals, according to a report from investment banking firm Capstone Partners.\n\nActivity has picked up a little during the summer, however. Since the start of June, notable deals have included Gill Energy buying Dutchess Terminals and its 13 retail locations, Applegreen getting the rights to remodel and run 18 travel centers in Massachusetts, Sampson-Bladen Oil Co. agreeing to acquire the 15-location Breeze Thru Markets chain and MAPCO buying 35 stores from Couche-Tard.\n\nSo there\u2019s still hope that 2025 could outperform 2024.\n\n$9.1 billion The price tag on Sunoco\u2019s deal for Parkland Corp.\n\nIn June, Parkland Corp\u2019s shareholders voted to accept energy company Sunoco\u2019s $9.1 billion buyout offer. Now that Alimentation Couche-Tard has withdrawn its bid for 7-Eleven parent company Seven & i, it\u2019s quite possible this will be the biggest deal of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what Sunoco is going to do with the thousands of stores it\u2019s getting in the acquisition, but the industry will surely be watching to see whether it keeps them or sparks a new round of M&A by offloading them.\n\nWho knows? If the upward trajectory in M&A continues, maybe by the end of the year it\u2019ll get unseated at the top of the \u201cbiggest M&A\u201d heap",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Retail M&A sees mixed trends, large deals persist despite c-store slowdown.\n\n**Key details:** Retail M&A activity increased 20% year-over-year through May, according to Bain & Company. Conversely, convenience store and fuel distribution M&A declined 35.7% through mid-May, reaching just nine announced deals. However, activity in the c-store sector picked up during the summer with several notable transactions. In June, Sunoco completed a $9.1 billion buyout of Parkland Corp., marking a potentially significant deal for the year.\n\n**Why it matters:** The 20% rise in overall retail M&A challenges the perception that broad market uncertainty, including looming tariffs, is universally deterring deal-making. In contrast, the significant 35.7% decline in c-store M&A contradicts this broader retail trend, indicating distinct sector-specific caution. This divergence challenges a singular consensus view on the health of M&A activity. Well-capitalized companies may view the current uncertainty as an opportunity for strategic expansion. Sunoco's large acquisition could prompt further M&A in the industry if it decides to offload some acquired assets.\n\n**The big picture:** This analysis examines the broader M&A landscape for the second half, specifically how activity is shaping out in 2025. Tariffs have been a looming concern, with experts almost evenly split on their potential impact on acquisition activity. Historically, some companies that emerged strongest from the 2008 financial crisis strategically expanded their businesses during the downturn.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **20%**: Increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n*   **35.7%**: Decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n*   **9**: Total announced c-store and fuel distribution M&A deals through mid-May.\n*   **$9.1 billion**: Price tag for Sunoco\u2019s acquisition of Parkland Corp.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Goldman Sachs**: Reported on experts' split views regarding tariffs' potential impact on M&A activity.\n*   **Bain & Company**: Published a midyear M&A report predicting continued consolidation deals throughout 2025.\n*   **Capstone Partners**: Investment banking firm that reported on the decline in c-store M&A activity.\n*   **Gill Energy**: Acquired Dutchess Terminals, including its 13 retail locations, in a summer transaction.\n*   **Applegreen**: Secured rights to remodel and operate 18 travel centers in Massachusetts.\n*   **Sampson-Bladen Oil Co.**: Agreed to acquire the 15-location Breeze Thru Markets chain.\n*   **MAPCO**: Purchased 35 stores from Couche-Tard, contributing to recent M&A activity.\n*   **Couche-Tard**: Sold 35 stores to MAPCO and withdrew its bid for 7-Eleven parent Seven & i.\n*   **Sunoco**: Completed a $9.1 billion buyout of Parkland Corp., potentially the year's largest M&A deal.\n*   **Parkland Corp.**: Its shareholders accepted the $9.1 billion buyout offer from energy company Sunoco.\n*   **Seven & i**: Parent company of 7-Eleven, whose bid was withdrawn by Alimentation Couche-Tard.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The industry will be watching to see what Sunoco decides to do with the thousands of acquired stores.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Retail M&A shows mixed trends, but major deals continue to reshape the landscape.",

When including the start of 2026, Murphy anticipates opening 50 new stores within the next 12 months, President and CEO Andrew Clyde said during the call.\n\nThese sites are part of Murphy\u2019s years-long plan to open 500 newly built c-stores by 2033 , a goal which the company launched in 2023. So far, Murphy\u2019s new stores featuring the company\u2019s modernized design are heavily outperforming its traditional locations.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMurphy opened 14 new stores in the first half of the year and, as of Thursday, has 40 additional NTIs under construction, Jeff said. It will begin building another 10 in the next several weeks, Jeff said. The executive added that Murphy should reach 40 NTIs by the end of 2025 as long as it doesn\u2019t experience any \u201csupply chain shocks or jurisdictional delays.\u201d\n\nDuring Q1, Murphy\u2019s new locations \u2014 which are double the size of its traditional 1,400-square-foot sites \u2014 outperformed Murphy\u2019s older stores, with nearly 40% better merchandise margins and 20% more fuel gallons sold.\n\nJeff credited Murphy\u2019s store development team, which is \u201caggressively looking for great sites.\u201d The company\u2019s pipeline of new stores stands at over 250, and Murphy expects to open 15 to 20 more in the first quarter of 2026, he added.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see really good results from the stores that are open, and now we're building the pipeline to open more,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Murphy has had some hiccups in its NTI development over the past year, including scheduling setbacks that hurt fuel and merchandise sales because stores were operating for less time than expected.\n\nIn 2023, Murphy set a five-year plan to generate $1.3 billion in EBITDA by 2028, and Clyde said on Thursday\u2019s call that the retailer is about $20 million behind expectations due to store construction delays. However, the newly built stores are \u201cperforming well above pro forma\u201d and can help make up for lost ground.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory of the business will look far different in 2028 versus what we see today as we ramp up our NTI program,\u201d Clyde said.",

As of Thursday, 40 additional NTIs are under construction, with plans to begin building another 10 in the next several weeks.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nMurphy's new, modernized stores are significantly outperforming its traditional locations, showing nearly 40% better merchandise margins and 20% more fuel gallons sold in Q1. These larger sites are performing \"well above pro forma\" and are crucial for the company to achieve its 2028 EBITDA target.

The retailer\u2019s same-store sales fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to contract by another 1.5% in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn top of that, 7-Eleven faced frequent organizational disruption during the year, including a takeover attempt by Alimentation Couche-Tard initiated last summer..

This significant drop occurred even as his fixed salary increased by about $200,000 year over year. Over 90% of his annual earnings are performance-based incentives, designed to encourage achievement of performance targets. The higher 2023 earnings included long-term incentives related to the 2021 acquisition of Speedway stores.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nDePinto's compensation decrease signals significant financial setbacks for 7-Eleven, including a 2.7% same-store sales fall in fiscal 2024 due to mounting economic challenges like inflation. This reflects increasingly difficult operating conditions impacting not just 7-Eleven, but also other c-store CEOs whose earnings dropped. The direct link between DePinto's pay and performance challenges any view that the convenience retail sector is immune to broader economic pressures. It highlights how leadership compensation is directly tied to the company's financial health.\n\n**The big picture:**\n7-Eleven endured organizational disruption and economic challenges, including a takeover attempt by Alimentation Couche-Tard that flopped.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that 2024 was a challenging year for convenience retailers. Not only did the tough operating environment result in less revenue for some of the largest players in the industry, but their CEOs earned less as well.\n\nWhile each company\u2019s situation was unique, convenience retailers across the industry faced many of the same challenges \u2014 from rising building costs and construction delays to hiring and retention woes \u2014 that left retailers in a tight financial spot heading into 2025.\n\nTotal compensation packages for c-store CEOs include various stock- and equity-driven awards that fluctuate considerably. This means an executive can make several millions more \u2014 or less \u2014 in one year than they did the previous, even if their base salary is the same.\n\nLast year, executives from some of the largest publicly traded c-store retailers saw sizable changes in their earnings because of the presence or absence of these incentives.\n\nHere\u2019s how the CEOs at some of the top publicly traded c-store retailers got paid in 2024, according to C-Store Dive\u2019s analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission documents.\n\nJoseph DePinto\n\n7-Eleven\n\n$29.6 million\n\nJoseph DePinto, 7-Eleven\u2019s CEO since 2005, earned 4.34 billion yen, or about $29.6 million in fiscal 2024 \u2014 a notable drop from the $52 million he earned in fiscal 2023, according to parent company Seven & i Holdings\u2019 last two annual securities reports. This drop came even as DePinto\u2019s salary, which Seven & i calls \u201cfixed compensation,\u201d was about $2 million \u2014 higher than the $1.8 million he earned in 2023.\n\nOver 90% of DePinto\u2019s annual earnings result from performance-based incentives \u201cin order to encourage the achievement of performance targets,\u201d Seven & i said in its securities reports.\n\nThe company did not specify why DePinto\u2019s performance-based earnings were so much lower than in fiscal 2023. However, 7-Eleven endured significant financial setbacks last year as it faced mounting economic challenges brought on by inflation. The retailer\u2019s same-store sales fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to contract by another 1.5% in fiscal 2025.\n\nDePinto also resigned from Seven & i\u2019s board of directors in March.\n\nEric Slifka\n\nGlobal Partners LP\n\n$14 million\n\nEric Slifka, Global Partners\u2019 president and CEO since 2005, garnered just over $14 million in fiscal 2024, outpacing the $11 million he earned in 2023, according to the company\u2019s annual 10-K filing.\n\nEric Slifka, Global Partners\u2019 president and CEO since 2005, garnered just over $14 million in fiscal 2024. Retrieved from Global Partners\n\nOn top of his $1.1 million salary \u2014 a $100,000 bump from the previous two years \u2014 Slifka\u2019s 2024 compensation increase largely resulted from various awards and non-equity plan compensation, which brought him a combined $12.8 million. His 2024 payday is a significant bump compared to what he made in the several years before 2023, including $11.5 million in 2022, $6.5 million in 2021 and $5.5 million in 2020.\n\nSlifka, who was also named Global Partners\u2019 chairman earlier this year, helped the company reach $1.1 billion in gross profits during fiscal 2024, a bump from the $974 million it garnered in 2023.\n\nAndrew Clyde\n\nMurphy USA\n\n$11 million\n\nAndrew Clyde, president and CEO of Murphy USA since 2013, saw about a $500,000 bump in his total compensation year over year, reaching just over $11 million in 2024 according to Murphy\u2019s latest proxy statement.\n\nClyde\u2019s total compensation has now surpassed $10 million in three straight years after reaching the figure for the first time in fiscal 2022. The main catalyst for the latest increase came from about $1.5 million more in stock- and option-based awards in 2024 compared to 2023. The $500,000 bump came even as Clyde saw his salary drop by about $13,000 compared to 2023, and in a year in which Murphy saw its full-year revenue drop by about 6%.\n\nWael Sawan\n\nShell plc\n\n$11 million\n\nShell CEO Wael Wawan took home $11 million in fiscal 2024, an increase from the $9.9 million he garnered the year before, according to the company\u2019s annual 20-F filing. Not only was Sawan\u2019s base salary of $1.9 million about 4% higher than in 2023, but Sawan also received about $300,000 more in annual bonuses than the prior year. Sawan\u2019s salary increased once again at the start of 2025 \u2014 by about 5.5%, according to the report.\n\nThese increases came during a year in which Shell\u2019s total cash flow from operations remained essentially unchanged from 2023, but were still lower than in 2022, according to the report. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s board of directors was satisfied with his performance.\n\n\u201cWael Sawan has demonstrated clear and decisive leadership, driving growth where we have a competitive advantage, and making tough decisions to pause and address performance challenges where needed,\u201d Shell said in its 20-F report.\n\nDarren Rebelez\n\nCasey\u2019s General Stores\n\n$10.6 million\n\nDarren Rebelez, president and CEO of Casey\u2019s since 2019 and chairman since 2023, took home nearly the same amount in fiscal 2024 as he did in the previous year \u2014 about $10.6M. Only $19,000 separated the two years, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement. Rebelez saw his salary grow by $50,000 and earned slightly more in stock awards and slightly less in non-equity incentive plan compensation compared to 2023.\n\nAlthough Rebelez\u2019s earnings remained relatively unchanged, he led Casey\u2019s through a year of tremendous growth, spearheading its acquisition of CEFCO Convenience Stores \u2014 the largest deal in company history \u2014 which marked Casey\u2019s entrance into three Southern states.\n\n\n\nWill Monteleone\n\nPar Pacific Holdings\n\n$9.8 million\n\nWill Monteleone, who became CEO of Par Pacific Holdings in April 2024, took home $9.8 million in his first full year leading the convenience retailer, according to the company's latest proxy statement. This marked a significant jump from the $2 million he made in 2023 when he was company president.\n\nA notable portion of Monteleon\u2019s earnings was the more than $6.5 million he made in option awards, according to the report. His promotion came during what Par Pacific called a \u201cchallenging financial year\u201d in which adjusted EBITDA dropped by more than 65%, according to its annual report.\n\nMurray Auchincloss\n\nBP plc\n\n$7.2 million\n\nMurray Auchincloss took home 5.4 million pounds, or about $7.2 million in his first full year as BP\u2019s CEO since succeeding former leader Bernard Looney in January 2024. The executive\u2019s earnings were notably less than in fiscal 2023, as BP experienced what it called \u201ca challenging year operationally,\u201d according to the report. The company saw declines across its customers and products business and axed its green investment strategy amid a major reset.\n\nThat reset has included laying off about 5% of its global workforce and shifting its focus from renewable energy back to oil production. The shift has also impacted BP\u2019s convenience store segments, although it\u2019s unclear to what extent.\n\nAlex Miller\n\nAlimentation Couche-Tard\n\n$6.8 million\n\nCouche-Tard President and CEO Alex Miller took home about CA$9.3 million, or $6.8 million, in his first year as head of the Canadian convenience retailer. Miller assumed leadership of Couche-Tard in September 2024 after longtime exec Brian Hannasch moved into an advisory role that he\u2019ll hold through October 2026. Miller\u2019s earnings were a jump from the CA$5.6 million, or about $4 million, he took home in fiscal 2023 while he was still chief operating officer.\n\nMiller\u2019s salary during the 2024 fiscal year was just over $1 million. The bulk of his earnings came from company share units and stock options, which garnered Miller a combined $5.6 million in the fiscal year. Miller\u2019s $6.8 million earned in fiscal 2024 was only half of what Hannasch made in fiscal 2023.\n\nMiller, who has been with Couche-Tard since 2012, led the convenience retailer through a profitable fiscal year during which its revenues increased by $3.6 billion, or 5.2%, compared with fiscal 2024. A major highlight of Miller\u2019s first year as CEO was the company\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of GetGo Caf\u00e9 + Markets, the convenience store arm of supermarket chain Giant Eagle.\n\nJoseph Kim\n\nSunoco\n\n$6.3 million\n\nJoseph Kim, president and CEO of Sunoco since 2018, garnered $6.3 million in fiscal 2024, a jump from the $5.5 million and $4.9 million he earned in 2023 and 2022, respectively, according to the company\u2019s annual 10-K filing. His salary was over $150,000 higher in 2024 compared to 2023 and he earned hundreds of thousands more in stock awards.\n\nKim notably led Sunoco through one of the biggest c-store deals in recent years when the Texas-based company agreed to acquire Parkland\u2019s assets for over $9 billion. Once the deal closes, The combined company will have an enterprise value of about $25.5 billion and become the largest independent fuel distributor in the Americas.\n\nRobert Espey\n\nParkland Corp.\n\n$6 million\n\nParkland Corp. President and CEO Robert Espey took home $6 million in fiscal 2024, a slight decrease from the $6.2 million he garnered in 2023, according to the company\u2019s latest information circular.\n\nParkland President and CEO Robert Espey earned $6 million in fiscal 2024, a slight decrease from the $6.2 million he garnered in 2023. Retrieved from Parkland\n\nEspey, who\u2019s led Parkland since 2011, is set to leave the company by the end of 2025 \u2014 a move announced during Parkland\u2019s strategic review earlier this year. According to the filing, Espey\u2019s employment was technically terminated on a \u201cwithout cause basis\u201d on April 30, and as part of his agreement to step down, he received a severance of about $5.2 million.\n\nAbout three weeks after Espey\u2019s resignation announcement, Parkland revealed that it agreed to sell its assets to Sunoco.\n\nArie Kotler\n\nArko Corp.\n\n$4.8 million\n\nArie Kotler, president, chairman and CEO of Arko Corp., saw his total earnings dip for the second straight year in fiscal 2024, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement.\n\nDespite seeing his salary rise by 3% in 2024, Kotler\u2019s $4.8 million in earnings was a decrease from the $6 million he garnered in 2023. A notable difference between the two years was that Kotler did not receive any option awards in 2024, compared to the $1.3 million in option awards he earned in 2023, according to the report.\n\nKotler\u2019s decreased earnings came after a challenging year for the company, which saw its merchandise revenue fall by $70.7 million, or 3.8%, and its fuel revenue decrease by $605.5 million, or 8.1%. Kotler told analysts earlier this year that the merchandising drop was largely due to underperforming stores that it closed or converted to dealer sites.\n\nCharles Nifong\n\nCrossAmerica Partners\n\n$1 million\n\nCharles Nifon, president and CEO of CrossAmerica Partners, earned just over $1 million in fiscal 2024, a $144,000 drop from his 2023 earnings, according to the company\u2019s latest 10-K filing.\n\nNifong\u2019s 2024 salary of $500,000 was the same as the prior year, and the difference in his earrings was how much of his target bonus he secured. According to the report, Nifong\u2019s target bonus is 125% of his base salary, or $625,000, and he took home $223,500 of that amount in 2024 compared to over $371,000 in 2023. The report notes that Nifong\u2019s bonus payout depends on CrossAmerica \u201cbeing financially efficient\u201d and \"maximizing operational excellence\u201d in its retail and wholesale operations.",

        "summary": "**Convenience Retail CEO Pay Mixed Amidst Challenging 2024**\n\n**Key details:**\nSeveral top convenience retail CEOs saw notable compensation changes in 2024, largely driven by performance incentives. Joseph DePinto of 7-Eleven experienced a significant pay drop coinciding with falling same-store sales. Conversely, leaders like Eric Slifka of Global Partners and Joseph Kim of Sunoco saw increases, often linked to company gross profit growth or major acquisitions. This variation highlights individual company performance amidst a difficult operating environment.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe varied CEO compensation challenges the initial notion that all convenience retail CEOs earned less in 2024 due to a tough environment. While some, like 7-Eleven's CEO, saw pay declines linked to financial setbacks, others experienced increases despite industry headwinds or even company revenue drops, often due to strategic deals or specific performance awards. This suggests that investment outcomes in the sector were not uniformly negative, with some companies managing growth or significant transactions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe year 2024 presented a challenging operating environment for convenience retailers, marked by rising building costs, construction delays, and hiring difficulties. CEO total compensation packages, heavily reliant on fluctuating stock- and equity-driven awards, led to considerable year-over-year earnings variability. Many executives from major publicly traded c-store retailers experienced sizable changes in their earnings because of these incentive structures.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Joseph DePinto (7-Eleven) 2024 compensation:** $29.6 million, down from $52 million in 2023.\n*   **7-Eleven same-store sales:** Fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024.\n*   **Global Partners LP gross profits:** Reached $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $974 million in 2023.\n*   **Sunoco-Parkland acquisition:** Over $9 billion deal, creating a combined $25.5 billion enterprise.\n*   **Alimentation Couche-Tard revenues:** Increased by $3.6 billion, or 5.2%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Joseph DePinto (7-Eleven):** CEO whose $29.6 million pay significantly dropped due to performance-based incentives.\n*   **Eric Slifka (Global Partners LP):** President and CEO who garnered $14 million leading gross profit growth.\n*   **Andrew Clyde (Murphy USA):** President and CEO whose compensation exceeded $10 million for three straight years.\n*   **Wael Sawan (Shell plc):** CEO whose $11 million pay increased, satisfying the company's board.\n*   **Darren Rebelez (Casey\u2019s General Stores):** CEO who led tremendous growth, including a record acquisition.\n*   **Joseph Kim (Sunoco):** President and CEO who led a major $9 billion c-store acquisition.\n*   **Robert Espey (Parkland Corp.):** President and CEO whose pay slightly decreased before his planned departure.\n*   **Arie Kotler (Arko Corp.):** CEO whose $4.8 million earnings dipped after a challenging year for the company.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   7-Eleven's same-store sales are expected to contract by another 1.5% in fiscal 2025.\n*   The Sunoco-Parkland deal, once closed, will create the largest independent fuel distributor in the Americas.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCEO pay reflects mixed performance across the challenging 2024 convenience retail landscape.",

        "summary_text": "Citi\u2019s commercial bank is jumping on chances to serve as a consolidator of banking services for clients that have incrementally built a global presence.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Tasnim Ghiawadwala, global head of the lender\u2019s commercial bank, who pointed to a client with $1 billion in annual sales, operating in 60 markets, that\u2019s dealing with 72 banks. That\u2019s the type of opportunity Citi aims to capitalize on, leaning on its global reach.\n\nFor mid-size companies, that situation \u201chappens sort of organically,\u201d she said. Early on, commercial clients aren\u2019t thinking from a global perspective. But smaller companies are taking an increasingly global posture, and as they rack up bank partners in multiple markets, it can \u201ccarry a huge amount of cost, to maintain such a large banking group,\u201d she said.\n\nTasnim Ghiawadwala Permission granted by Citi\n\nWith many companies finding themselves in that situation, \u201cI have no doubt about our ability to grow in this space,\u201d Ghiawadwala said. The New York-based lender maintained its global network \u2013 the bank\u2019s \u201cbiggest competitive advantage\u201d \u2013 when others with global ambitions retracted following the 2007-08 financial crisis, she noted.\n\nSimplifying banking could mean assisting in some or all of the countries where clients operate or structuring their liquidity needs more efficiently, she said. \u201cIn some instances, it makes sense for the client to use a local or regional bank for their needs and in other markets it makes more sense to use Citi instead,\u201d she said.\n\nServing in the consolidator role is \u201can opportunity for us to help them with harmonizing their banking relationships and centralizing their financial operations to have better visibility, increased access and ultimately generate efficiencies,\u201d she said.\n\nCiti has brought its commercial bank to several new markets over the last five years, including Western Europe, Canada and Japan. In the U.S., the commercial bank operates in 17 markets to cover top business hubs, although it works with clients across the country.\n\nCiti doesn\u2019t disclose the size of the commercial business, although Ghiawadwala said it\u2019s a \u201cdecent part\u201d of Citi\u2019s banking segment. Citi\u2019s banking revenues rose 18% in the second quarter, to $1.9 billion, although that also includes investment banking and corporate lending.\n\nThe lender is working to draw in new mid-sized corporate clients and do more for its current roster, she said. Growing the commercial client segment is one of Citi\u2019s main priorities this year and next.\n\nWhen asked about the size of the opportunity envisioned, the bank pointed to Ghiawadwala\u2019s comments from 2022, when she told investors the bank is focused on an addressable opportunity of about $150 billion; the bank\u2019s share of that was about 2% in 2022, and she said the bank sought to double that share.\n\n\u201cEven our existing clients are growing, and so, as they grow, their banking needs are changing,\u201d Ghiawadwala noted in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s really a lot for us to do in terms of absolutely realizing our full potential.\u201d\n\nThe lender has bankers on the ground in 90 countries, and a global relationship manager oversees a client\u2019s entire reach across various markets, she said. Commercial clients do between $10 million to $3 billion in sales annually, with the \u201csweet spot\u201d being companies already operating in a few countries that are looking for a global bank, she said.\n\nThe bank counted 14,000 commercial clients in 2022; Citi declined to share a current number. The lender focuses on six \u201csuper sectors\u201d: industrials, digital technology and communications, retail, healthcare, business and professional services, and nonbank financial institutions.\n\nCiti aims to serve clients\u2019 everyday banking needs and as a strategic partner when it comes to investments and guidance. About 90% of clients are privately held businesses, and Citi aims to tap different parts of the bank when needed, such as if clients are looking to go public, Ghiawadwala said.\n\nThese mid-sized corporate customers particularly appreciate consumer-like capabilities in banking, because they\u2019re companies that don\u2019t have as much formal structure or lack big treasury or finance teams, she said.\n\nTreasury management, for example, isn\u2019t something companies tend to consider at the outset. As firms go through growing pains, \u201cthat\u2019s where we can kind of come in and bring our large company experience,\u201d Ghiawadwala said.\n\nCiti has sought to simplify functions for clients \u2013 thinking through the number of clicks it takes to handle a task, or what web menus look like \u2013 while providing robust capabilities that some of the world\u2019s largest companies turn to the bank for.\n\nThe bank unified functions through a new platform, introduced in 2023, that provides a single digital user interface. Last month, the bank added a digital credit application capability for smaller loans and an automated self-service credit management process, which allows Citi to monitor covenance without having to reach out to remind clients for information.\n\nIn the markets that have added those tools, about 20% of commercial clients are using its digital lending capabilities, the bank said.\n\nCiti is also working to digitize banker tasks, with the bank\u2019s artificial intelligence-powered assistant Stylus, to bolster productivity when it comes to generating reports and other duties. A heatmap tool, rolled out earlier this year, helps bankers identify geographic locations clients operate in, as bankers consider products that would be beneficial, Ghiawadwala said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Citi's Commercial Bank Targets Global Mid-Sized Firms For Consolidation\n\n**Key details:**\nCiti\u2019s commercial bank is focusing on consolidating banking services for mid-size clients that have developed a global presence. These companies often operate in many markets, dealing with numerous banks, which incurs significant costs. Citi aims to simplify relationships, centralize financial operations, and enhance visibility and efficiency for these clients. The bank has expanded its commercial operations into new markets including Western Europe, Canada, and Japan over the last five years. It also launched a unified digital platform in 2023, adding new digital credit capabilities recently.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis strategy offers a clear path for Citi to grow its commercial client segment, a main priority for this year and next. It helps mid-size companies reduce costs, gain better financial visibility, and increase access to services. Citi views its maintained global network as a key competitive advantage, contrasting with other banks that retracted their global ambitions after the 2007-08 financial crisis. This suggests Citi is leveraging a differentiated approach against a past industry trend, potentially challenging a consensus view that global expansion is universally risky or less desirable for commercial banks post-crisis.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMid-size companies are increasingly adopting a global posture, often organically accumulating multiple bank partners across markets, leading to high maintenance costs. Citi identified this situation as an opportunity to grow by offering to harmonize banking relationships. The bank has bankers on the ground in 90 countries and focuses on commercial clients with annual sales between $10 million and $3 billion. Citi\u2019s approach leverages its long-standing global network, which it maintained when other banks scaled back their international reach.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   $1.9 billion: Citi's banking revenues in Q2, up 18%.\n*   $150 billion: Addressable opportunity Citi focused on in 2022.\n*   2%: Citi's share of the $150 billion opportunity in 2022.\n*   90: Countries where Citi has bankers on the ground.\n*   14,000: Commercial clients Citi counted in 2022.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Citi:** Global lender focused on growing its commercial bank by consolidating services for mid-sized companies internationally.\n*   **Tasnim Ghiawadwala:** Global head of Citi's commercial bank, outlining the bank's strategy and growth opportunities.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Growing the commercial client segment is a main priority for Citi this year and next.\n*   Citi aims to double its 2022 share of the $150 billion addressable opportunity.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCiti leverages global reach to consolidate banking for growing mid-size firms.",

        "summary_text": "Wells Fargo intends to give CEO Charlie Scharf a $30 million one-time equity award and install him as chair of its board, in addition to serving as chief executive, the bank announced Thursday.\n\nThe move is meant to lock Scharf into leading Wells for the next six years and recognize his role in restoring the bank\u2019s reputation, boosting its risk and control infrastructure, and identifying and investing in \u201ccore\u201d business areas.\n\nRegulators have terminated 13 consent orders against Wells since Scharf became CEO in 2019, including a $1.95 trillion asset cap the Federal Reserve lifted in June \u2013 a remnant of the bank\u2019s 2016 fake-accounts scandal.\n\nWells did not give a timeline for handing the chair role to Scharf \u2013 nor did it detail a future role for the bank\u2019s current chair, Steven Black. The bank did, however, note that it intends to appoint a lead independent director. Scharf and Black have served together before; Black was a director on BNY\u2019s board when Scharf served as chair and CEO of the bank in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to recognize Charlie's significant contributions to Wells Fargo,\u201d Black said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to Charlie\u2019s continued guidance and strategic direction as we navigate the future.\"\n\nDepending on the timing, Wells could become the third U.S.-based systemically important financial institution to combine its chair and CEO roles this year. BNY in June named CEO Robin Vince to concurrently serve as its chair, starting Sept. 1. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick assumed chair responsibilities Jan. 1. That leaves Citi as the only U.S. SIFI (there are eight) to maintain separate chair and CEO roles.\n\nScharf would also become at least the third CEO of a top-10 U.S. bank this year to receive an eight-figure equity award. Goldman Sachs disclosed in January that it would give CEO David Solomon an $80 million retention bonus. The bank gave the same deal to President John Waldron, drawing criticism from proxy advisers this spring. Capital One, meanwhile, granted CEO Richard Fairbank a $30 million one-time award in June after the bank closed its long-running acquisition of Discover.\n\nScharf\u2019s award is not limited to $30 million in restricted share rights. He also is set to receive 1,046,000 stock options. The award will vest on a pro rata basis following the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the grant date. Unvested portions of the award will be forfeited if Scharf resigns or retires earlier, the bank said. Also, Scharf must keep at least 50% of the vested shares throughout his time at Wells and a year after he leaves, according to the bank.\n\nScharf, in a statement Thursday, largely deferred to his team.\n\n\u201cOver the last several years, our Operating Committee and our 213,000 employees have executed a multi-faceted transformation under extremely difficult circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a privilege to lead Wells Fargo and our talented and dedicated team, and I look forward to building on our significant momentum to continue improving our performance and market position in everything we do.\u201d\n\nThe award further stabilizes leadership at Wells and removes any incentive Scharf might have to explore options outside of the bank. Observers have casually speculated that Scharf could have been a dark-horse candidate to succeed mentor Jamie Dimon as CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Dimon has hinted that the clock is ticking on his tenure atop the bank, and a series of personnel moves \u2013 first in 2021, then last year and again this year (twice) \u2013 has alternately raised the profiles of various potential internal successors.\n\nThe value of Scharf\u2019s award will fluctuate along with Wells\u2019 stock price, the bank said. The options, for their part, will only have value insofar as the bank\u2019s stock price appreciates throughout the vesting period.\n\nScharf wasn\u2019t the only Wells executive whose compensation came under the microscope. Wells\u2019 human resources committee decided not to keep a target total compensation structure for its named executive officers, the bank said Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The panel, rather, will \u201cdetermine incentive compensation for each NEO, including the CEO, using a holistic performance assessment that evaluates NEO performance based on individual and Company performance, as well as line of business performance, where applicable, relative to established financial and non-financial performance criteria,\u201d the bank said.\n\nScharf will be Wells\u2019 first CEO-chair hybrid in nearly a decade. The bank changed its bylaws after former Chair and CEO John Stumpf resigned in October 2016, to require an independent chair. Wells amended those bylaws this week to allow Scharf to serve in a dual capacity. Another new amendment requires the bank to maintain an independent lead director.",

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, and Cynthia Lummis, R-WY, in 2022 aimed to do.\n\nThe group also said federal banking regulators \u2013 the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and National Credit Union Administration \u2013 \u201cshould never again pursue the Biden Administration\u2019s policies of Operation Choke Point 2.0 and should instead embrace the opportunities digital assets and blockchain technologies offer to banks nationwide.\u201d That referred to an alleged coordinated regulatory effort by the Biden administration to undercut the crypto industry by blocking it out of the banking system.\n\nBanking regulators should ensure risk management guidance is technology-neutral, and should relaunch efforts to provide clarity on activities banks want to pursue, the report said.\n\n\u201cTo support these efforts, the United States should adopt capital requirements for bank digital asset activities that accurately reflect the risk of the asset or activity,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe relevant federal banking regulators should provide clarity and transparency regarding the process for eligible institutions to obtain a bank charter or a Reserve Bank master account.\u201d\n\nCrypto-focused bank Custodia tried and failed to obtain a Reserve Bank master account. Custodia fought the Fed in court over it and lost, with a judge last year ruling that federal laws don\u2019t require the Fed to give every eligible institution a master account.\n\nThe report\u2019s primary suggestions included strengthening the role of the U.S. dollar by moving forward \u201cfaithfully and expeditiously to implement the GENIUS Act\u201d \u2013 which creates a framework for stablecoins and was recently enacted \u2013 and combating illicit finance by modernizing anti-money laundering rules to suit digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, the group suggested Internal Revenue Service updates to eliminate compliance hurdles for both individuals and businesses engaged in crypto-related activities. Congress, the working group wrote, should enact legislation treating crypto as a new class of assets subject to modified securities and commodities tax rules for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCrypto industry players celebrated the release of the report, which Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley called a \u201cblueprint for achieving more regulatory clarity for the industry and the millions of Americans who use crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe comprehensive and thoughtful recommendations from the working group are exactly what we need to drive innovation and unlock the next era of U.S. leadership in global finance,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cCoupled with a recent series of legislative breakthroughs \u2014 such as the historic GENIUS Act \u2014 we are achieving clearer rules of the road nearly every week.\u201d",

The article does not explicitly describe a current consensus view on the company or industry, nor does it explicitly state how this information challenges such a view.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBefore Skadden and SoFi, Cohen served as counsel to the banking regulation and policy group of the Federal Reserve Board and for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s division of clearing and risk. At Skadden, he co-led the firm\u2019s financial institutions regulatory group, advising global and regional banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions. His advisory work at Skadden included matters such as mergers and acquisitions, charters, stablecoin, digital asset issues, and compliance for major clients like BlackRock and Citi.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Cohen spent two years at SoFi (2022 to 2024).\n*   He joins the OCC on Aug. 11.\n*   Advised BlackRock on its $12 billion acquisition of HPS Investment Partners.\n*   Advised BlackRock on its $3 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Adam Cohen:** Former SoFi general counsel appointed the OCC's new senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel.\n*   **Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC):** Federal regulator appointing Adam Cohen to a key leadership and legal oversight role.\n*   **SoFi:** Fintech company whose former general counsel, Adam Cohen, was appointed to a key OCC role.\n*   **Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP:** Law firm Cohen is leaving, where he co-led the financial institutions regulatory group.\n*   **Comptroller Jonathan Gould:** OCC head who praised Cohen's experience and announced his significant appointment.\n*   **Federal Reserve Board:** Where Cohen previously served as counsel for the banking regulation and policy group.\n*   **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC):** Where Cohen previously worked for the division of clearing and risk.\n*   **BlackRock:** Advised by Cohen at Skadden on multi-billion dollar acquisitions.\n*   **HPS Investment Partners:** Was subject of a $12 billion acquisition deal advised by Cohen.\n*   **Global Infrastructure Partners:** Was subject of a $3 billion acquisition deal advised by Cohen.\n*   **Citi:** Advised by Cohen at Skadden on the separation of its Banamex entity.\n*   **Banamex:** Citi entity whose separation was advised by Cohen at Skadden.\n*   **Fortress Investment Group:** Advised by Cohen on its investment in a bank holding company.\n*   **First Foundation:** Bank holding company that received investment advised by Cohen.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Adam Cohen will officially join the OCC on August 11.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nExperienced financial services lawyer Adam Cohen joins OCC, strengthening federal banking oversight.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy touted the size advantage AWS holds over its closest cloud competitors \u2014 Microsoft and Google \u2014 Thursday during the company\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call for the three-months ending June 30.\n\n\u201cWe have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others,\u201d Jassy said, pointing to the cloud unit's $123 billion in annualized revenue run rate. \u201cI think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS.\u201d\n\nJassy also alluded to Microsoft\u2019s recent and ongoing cyber issues tied to vulnerabilities in the SharePoint document management tool. \u201cThere are very different results in security in AWS than you'll see in other players,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could just go through what's happened the last couple of months \u2026 you can see kind of \u2018adventures\u2019 at some of these players almost every month.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAWS has long been king of the hill in cloud, defending its leading share of the steadily growing market for infrastructure and compute services. The hyperscaler increased revenue 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion in Q2 and reported nearly $108 billion in 2024 revenue, a 19% increase over the prior year.\n\nMicrosoft, by comparison, saw Azure cloud revenue spike 34% to $75 billion during its most recent fiscal year. The company had not previously reported Azure financials separately from other services bundled in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Google Cloud, which experienced its first profitable quarter more than two years ago, grew its annual revenue 31% to $43.4 billion in 2024.\n\nWhile the rapid rise of large language model technologies didn\u2019t shuffle the standings in Q2, generative AI adoption continued to stoke demand for cloud. Global spend on cloud services increased nearly 25% to $99 billion during the three-month period, driven by triple-digit growth in cloud-based AI, according to a Thursday Synergy Research Group report. AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud split the lion\u2019s share of cloud spend, commanding 30%, 20% and 13% of the market, respectively.\n\n\u201cTake a bow Gen AI, which has lit a fire under cloud service development and helped to propel the market to new highs,\u201d SRG Chief Analyst John Dinsdale said in an email. \u201cWe saw growth of 140-180% in Gen AI-specific cloud services, and AI is also contributing to enhancements and added growth across the broader portfolio of cloud services.\u201d\n\nThe trend triggered an ongoing hyperscale race to add capacity. Amazon led the pack, committing $100 billion to capital investments in cloud infrastructure this year. The company piled $31.4 billion in Q2 investments on top of the nearly $25 billion it spent in the first quarter and expects CapEx to remain at that level through the back half of the year, according to CFO Brian Olsavsky.\n\n\u201cWe have more demand than we have capacity at this point,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cWe will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI.\u201d\n\nAWS is steadily adding to its stockpile of AI capabilities. The company deployed AI agent-building platform AgentCore along with coding assistant agent Kiro last month, and rolled out open-source AI agent developer tool Strands Agents in May.\n\nAWS\u2019 backlog cloud business has grown in step with AI adoption, increasing year-over-year by 25% to $195 billion, according to Jassy, who said he expects capacity constraints to ease gradually over the next several quarters.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest constraint is power,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cYou also see constraints off and on with chips \u2026 I think it will take several quarters, but I do expect it's going to get better each quarter.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** AWS Touts Dominance as AI Fuels Cloud Demand, Faces Capacity Crunch\n\n**Key details:**\nAWS CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the cloud unit's $123 billion annualized revenue run rate, stating the second player is about 65% of its size. AWS increased Q2 revenue 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion. Generative AI adoption continued to fuel cloud demand, with global cloud spend up nearly 25% to $99 billion in Q2. AWS's backlog cloud business increased 25% year-over-year to $195 billion. However, the company is experiencing capacity constraints, primarily due to power and chips.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis news reinforces AWS's leading market share in cloud, driven by strong generative AI demand that propelled cloud spending to new highs. CEO Jassy emphasized AWS's significant size advantage and superior security over rivals. However, the revelation of current capacity constraints, particularly in power and chips, suggests potential near-term limitations on capitalizing on this demand. This challenges a possible market consensus that cloud providers can seamlessly scale to meet explosive AI-driven growth. The issue is expected to gradually ease over several quarters, per Jassy.\n\n**The big picture:**\nAWS has historically maintained its position as the leader in the steadily growing market for infrastructure and compute services. The rapid emergence of large language model technologies has significantly accelerated demand for cloud services. This trend has triggered an ongoing hyperscale race among providers to significantly increase their infrastructure capacity. Amazon is making substantial capital investments, committing $100 billion this year, to meet this surging demand.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   AWS annualized revenue run rate: $123 billion.\n*   AWS Q2 revenue: $30.9 billion, up 17.5% year over year.\n*   AWS market share: 30%, compared to Microsoft (20%) and Google Cloud (13%).\n*   AWS backlog cloud business: $195 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase.\n*   Amazon's 2024 capital investment commitment: $100 billion in cloud infrastructure.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Amazon:** Parent company of AWS, committing $100 billion to cloud infrastructure investments this year.\n*   **AWS:** Amazon's cloud unit, touting its \"meaningfully larger business\" and market leadership.\n*   **Andy Jassy:** Amazon CEO, highlighted AWS's size advantage and security, and backlog growth.\n*   **Microsoft:** Closest cloud competitor, Azure revenue spiked 34% to $75 billion in its recent fiscal year.\n*   **Google Cloud:** Cloud competitor, annual revenue grew 31% to $43.4 billion in 2024.\n*   **Brian Olsavsky:** Amazon CFO, indicated CapEx levels would continue through the second half of the year.\n*   **Synergy Research Group:** Reported global cloud services spending and market share distribution in Q2.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Capacity constraints in power and chips are expected to ease gradually over the next several quarters.\n*   Amazon's capital expenditure levels are projected to remain consistent through the back half of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAWS leads cloud, driven by AI demand, but faces temporary capacity limits.",

The initial phase of the partnership gives customers of both companies new capabilities, such as direct bank-to-wallet connection, which enables JPMorgan customers to link their bank accounts to Coinbase wallets using the lender\u2019s application programming interface .\n\n. Chase is also allowing customers to transfer their Chase Ultimate Rewards points directly to Coinbase accounts at a 1:1 redemption ratio \u2013 100 points equal to $1 in value \u2013 and use their accumulated rewards points to fund their Coinbase accounts .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nStarting this fall, customers can also fund their Coinbase accounts using Chase credit cards, according to the press release.\n\nThe direct bank-to-wallet and ultimate rewards features will go live next year, the companies said.\n\n\u201cBy joining forces with Coinbase, we are enhancing the security and privacy of our customers' data, allowing them to use their money and rewards in new and exciting ways,\u201d Melissa Feldsher, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of payments and lending innovation, said in a statement. \u201cCustomers can now seamlessly and securely convert their points into cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s partnership with JPMorgan comes almost a week after the crypto exchange announced it has teamed up with PNC to offer crypto-as-a-service. PNC customers soon will be able to buy, sell and hold crypto through Coinbase.\n\n\u201cTogether, we are expanding choice and lowering barriers to entry for consumers to participate in the future of financial services onchain,\u201d Max Branzburg, head of consumer and business products at Coinbase, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nEmilie Choi, president of Coinbase, noted their partnership with Plaid remains active and that the Chase integration is meant to expand consumer options, not replace the existing ones.\n\n\u201cOur primary partner continues to be @Plaid whose efforts on open banking we deeply support,\u201d Choi wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had hinted at the biggest U.S. bank\u2019s plans to get involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins, \u201cto understand it and be good at it,\u201d when the bank reported second-quarter earnings earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re real, but I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want a stablecoin as opposed to just a payment,\u201d Dimon noted. Despite his skepticism, Dimon indicated JPMorgan plans to be involved in the space to \u201cbe cognizant\u201d and \u201clearning a lot.\u201d\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe tie-up comes amid escalating tensions between traditional banks and fintechs over consumer data access rights and associated costs.\n\nJPMorgan has sent notices to data aggregators recently to inform them of new fees for data access, which would be imposed as soon as September. The direct relationship with JPMorgan and fintechs could allow the latter to bypass traditional aggregators like Plaid and MX Technologies.\n\nCrypto billionaire Tyler Winklevoss has publicly opposed the policy and later said JPMorgan paused onboarding his crypto exchange Gemini in retaliation for his criticism, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn a recent note to Feldsher, a JPMorgan systems employee wrote in an internal memo that aggregators are accessing customer data several times a day, even when the customer is not actively using the app, thereby \u201cmassively taxing\u201d the lender\u2019s systems, CNBC reported.\n\nThe gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance is narrowing in 2025, driven by relaxed regulatory oversight and a push for comprehensive federal cryptocurrency legislation, as evidenced by the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month.\n\nSeveral significant partnerships between traditional banks and crypto companies have emerged recently, such as BNY\u2019s announcement that it will custody reserves for Ripple's new stablecoin, Ripple USD. BNY previously established a similar partnership with Societe Generale for their CoinVertible USD stablecoin.\n\nIn April, digital bank Green Dot said it would partner with Crypto.com to offer banking and money management tools to the crypto exchange\u2019s U.S. customers through the bank\u2019s embedded finance platform, Arc.",

Azure cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year to more than $75 billion in the 12 months ending June 30, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings release.\n\nCompetition in the UK cloud market is \u201cnot working well,\u201d the CMA said in its final decision, which singled out Microsoft\u2019s software licensing practices for \u201cadversely impacting the competitiveness of AWS and Google in the supply of cloud services.\u201d The market watchdog recommended actions that would \u201cimpose targeted and bespoke interventions\u201d to remedy the situation.\n\nMicrosoft reiterated objections raised in a February response to the investigation. \u201cThe CMA Panel\u2019s most recent publication misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cMicrosoft looks forward to working with the Digital Markets Unit toward an outcome that more accurately reflects the current competition in cloud.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMicrosoft is one of three U.S. cloud superpowers that together dominate nearly two-thirds of the global market for infrastructure services. AWS leads with 29% of the market, followed by Microsoft and Google Cloud, whose shares are 22% and 12% respectively, according to Synergy Research Group May analysis.\n\nIn Europe, the trio's combined footprint is even larger proportionally, swallowing up 70% of the region\u2019s $70 billion in cloud spend last year, Synergy Research Group data show. Europe-based providers saw their collective share contract from 29% in 2017 to its current level of 15% in 2022, the analyst firm said in a July report.\n\nA surge in demand for cloud services, driven by AI adoption and ongoing workload migrations, sparked a hyperscaler building boom that has yet to subside.\n\nMicrosoft alone committed $80 billion to capital investments in its 2025 fiscal year and spent $24.2 billion during the final quarter, which included more than $17 billion on property, plants and equipment, EVP and CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The company expects CapEx to exceed $30 billion in the next quarter to satisfy escalating demand.\n\n\u201cEven as we continue bringing more datacenter capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWe have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud.\u201d\n\nAzure\u2019s growth spurt helped the cloud unit deliver more than one-quarter of Microsoft\u2019s $281 billion in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year. Intelligent Cloud, the larger division encompassing Azure, accounted for $106 billion or over one-third of the company\u2019s revenue for the 12-month period.\n\nLarge customers helped drive Azure\u2019s expansions, Nadella said, pointing to food and beverage behemoth Nestl\u00e9, which shuttered six aging data centers through a massive migration of over 200 SAP instances and 10,000-plus servers.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot, the generative AI chatbot embedded in the company\u2019s cloud-based office productivity suite, also contributed to the cloud usage surge. The company added two sales-focused AI agents to the Copilot family in March and added a pay-as-you-go Copilot plan at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cCustomers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite,\u201d Nadella said, citing Barclays\u2019 plan to equip 100,000 employees with the tool after an initial deployment to 15,000 colleagues.",

Despite this, Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year to over $75 billion in the 12 months ending June 30, 2025. The company expects capital expenditures (CapEx) to exceed $30 billion in the next quarter to meet escalating demand.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe CMA\u2019s final decision highlights increasing regulatory scrutiny on dominant cloud providers, potentially setting a precedent for similar actions globally. Singling out Microsoft\u2019s licensing practices challenges the current consensus that cloud competition is robust, directly contradicting Microsoft\u2019s claim of a \"dynamic and competitive\" market. This could lead to \"targeted and bespoke interventions\" impacting Microsoft's operational freedom and competitive positioning in the UK. However, Microsoft's significant CapEx and large contracted backlog ($368 billion) signal sustained high demand for its cloud services, suggesting robust underlying business momentum despite regulatory headwinds.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMicrosoft is one of three U.S. cloud \"superpowers\" that collectively dominate nearly two-thirds of the global market for infrastructure services. AWS leads with 29% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 22% and Google Cloud at 12%. In Europe, these three providers capture 70% of the region\u2019s $70 billion in cloud spend, while Europe-based providers saw their collective share contract significantly from 29% in 2017 to 15% in 2022. A surge in demand for cloud services, driven by AI adoption and workload migrations, has fueled a hyperscaler building boom. Azure's growth contributed over one-quarter of Microsoft\u2019s $281 billion in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Azure cloud services revenue: up 34% YoY, exceeding $75 billion (FY25).\n*   Microsoft's FY25 capital investments: $80 billion committed.\n*   Expected CapEx next quarter: will exceed $30 billion.\n*   Microsoft's contracted backlog: $368 billion.\n*   Microsoft's global cloud market share: 22%, behind AWS (29%).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Microsoft:** Received UK regulatory rebuke, strong cloud growth, objects to competition findings.\n*   **U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA):** Rebuke Microsoft, citing cloud market competition issues and licensing practices.\n*   **Satya Nadella:** Microsoft CEO, reported Azure growth and Copilot customer adoption rates.\n*   **AWS:** Competitor impacted by Microsoft's licensing, leading global cloud market share (29%).\n*   **Google Cloud:** Competitor impacted by Microsoft's licensing, third in global market share (12%).\n*   **Amy Hood:** Microsoft CFO, detailed capital expenditure plans and capacity constraint expectations.\n*   **Synergy Research Group:** Provided market share data for global and European cloud spending.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Microsoft's future engagement with the Digital Markets Unit to address competition findings.\n*   Microsoft expects capital expenditure to exceed $30 billion in the next quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMicrosoft faces UK regulatory pressure amid booming cloud demand and investment.",

Over 9 in 10 executives stated their board of directors supports software innovation benefits. About 80% of enterprise leaders are willing to invest over half their IT budget in software development. Executives credit increased AI use over the past year for an estimated 44% revenue bump. Nearly 3 in 5 respondents reported business growth due to software innovation in the last year.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBusinesses are actively seeking technology upgrades and AI tools to improve productivity, increase revenues, and drive profitability. Companies like Lowe's, The Home Depot, General Mills, and Charles Schwab have already attributed improvements and cost savings to AI efforts. While enterprises anticipate significant competitive advantages from AI agents, the article notes that most organizations are \"still working out the kinks.\" This challenges a view of seamless, widespread AI adoption by highlighting persistent hurdles like cybersecurity threats, data privacy concerns, and governance gaps, suggesting a complex implementation landscape.\n\n**The big picture:**\nA GitLab report, based on a survey of nearly 2,800 C-level executives by The Harris Poll, confirms broad executive belief in technology's positive impact. A PwC survey further indicates that nearly three-quarters of senior leaders expect AI agents to provide significant competitive advantages.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs the finance chief of the Institute of Internal Auditors, Ann Cohen has spent a decade navigating a role and an industry that has grown increasingly complex.\n\nFrom geopolitical risks to ESG expectations and the acceleration of digital transformation, she has watched the role of the CFO evolve alongside the audit function it supports. The IIA, whose members include nearly 200,000 certified internal auditors across 170 countries, sets internal audit standards, provides certifications and offers training and research opportunities for those working in internal audit.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, Cohen reflects on how audit quality has changed, the growing demands on internal audit teams and how members of her organization are thinking about the role of emerging technologies like agentic AI in the audit function.\n\nCohen also discusses what\u2019s kept her around for a decade, why strong internal audit relationships are critical and her perspective on issues shaping the profession \u2014 from the 150-hour CPA requirement to the skills and mindsets that define successful finance chiefs.\n\nAnn Cohen\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Ann Cohen\n\nCFO, Institute of Internal Auditors\n\nFirst CFO position: 2005\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nWoodfield Country Club\n\nBainbridge Companies\n\nTaylor Woodrow Developments\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nADAM ZAKI: Now that you\u2019re in your 10th year in the CFO seat at the IIA, what would you say has changed most about your role since you started?\n\nANN COHEN: Life as a CFO has just become so much more complex. The world has changed. Just look at the difference between the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic environments, for example. For my peers and me, factors like geopolitical risk, ESG expectations, new regulations and digital transformation have all added layers of complexity. And they\u2019re still evolving.\n\nAI is a great example. These emerging risks have made it a much more dynamic and difficult world to operate in. As a result, the audit process itself has become more complicated. We\u2019ve heard directly from our members, concerns such as \u2018Our auditors are struggling\u2019 or \u2018Why is this harder than it used to be?\u2019 The audit process itself is more difficult now.\n\nThe way audit has changed \u2014 how we work with people, how we access information, how we report \u2014 continues to evolve. To be effective, internal auditors now need to understand operations deeply. They need awareness of geopolitical factors, the ability to evaluate evolving risks and a strong grasp of internal controls. That level of insight takes work. It\u2019s a major challenge that makes what I do here really interesting.\n\nWhen you're developing global standards, how do you ensure they stay practical over time?\n\nWe stay close to our stakeholders \u2014 our National Institutes, global network, sponsors and regulators. We\u2019re constantly in listening mode: What\u2019s going on in your environment? What\u2019s shifting geopolitically? What risks are emerging in your region? Through advocacy and direct engagement, we keep a pulse on global developments. That helps us make sure our standards stay current and relevant.\n\nInternally, how does your audit oversight process work?\n\nWe have a chief audit executive who reports to our CEO, which is the standard structure in our profession. It\u2019s important they don\u2019t report to me as CFO because that could create a conflict; after all, they\u2019re auditing areas under my responsibility.\n\nThat said, we work very closely together. I see our internal audit leader as a strategic partner. We regularly collaborate on identifying risks, evaluating controls and improving our processes. She was actually in my office earlier today to talk about some IT-related topics. We\u2019re in constant contact.\n\nWhat do you think makes a healthy relationship between a CFO and their internal audit team?\n\nTransparency and trust are key. You have to be open and honest with one another. When the internal audit function identifies a finding, CFOs must ask questions \u2014 what they saw, how they found it, what their thinking was. But it\u2019s always from a place of curiosity, not defensiveness. That dynamic only works when both parties trust each other as true strategic partners.\n\nWhat is your role in developing the talent around your internal audit function?\n\nOur internal audit function works across the entire organization. So that means not just with me, but with our certification, membership and learning teams too. They provide insights into how operations are running, where control weaknesses might exist, and how risks are shifting. They also work closely with our risk manager to align on strategy. Everyone has their own strategic plan, and internal audit plays a critical role in helping us meet those goals.\n\nCan you provide details on how you and your members are talking about the role of agentic AI in audit?\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, there\u2019s definitely interest in using agentic AI. But right now, things are changing so fast. Everyone is trying to wrap their heads around what it means and how it will evolve. There\u2019s risk involved, like with all digital transformation, and the pace of change is dizzying.\n\nI read about it every day, and even then, it\u2019s hard to keep up. I can tell you that people are asking, \u2018When will this settle enough that we can implement it in a sustainable way? Where does it make sense for our organization? What will it cost?\u2019 Everyone wants to get there, but it\u2019s going to take time.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding the 150-hour CPA licensure requirement changes? Do you think it\u2019s lowering standards or removing an unnecessary boundary?\n\nThere are some valid points on both sides, but the changes' impact will likely not be as noticeable as if public accounting\u2019s other major issue were addressed.\n\nThe one piece we can\u2019t ignore is compensation. Aspiring CPAs need to be fairly compensated. When they graduate from college, they should be earning competitive salaries \u2014 comparable to other industries that may or may not require less schooling.\n\nWhether states keep or drop the 150-hour rule, we have to make accounting a competitive and attractive career path for all, and I think that conversation needs to be geared more towards compensation for those working in entry-level accounting positions.",

This is driven by evolving factors such as geopolitical risks, ESG expectations, new regulations, and digital transformation. The audit process itself is now more difficult, with internal auditors needing deeper operational understanding and a strong grasp of internal controls. Agentic AI holds long-term interest for audit, but its adoption is viewed as a lengthy process given rapid changes and inherent risks.\n\n**Why it matters:** The growing complexity directly impacts audit quality and the effectiveness of internal audit teams. Auditors are reportedly struggling, indicating a challenge to traditional audit capabilities in a rapidly changing environment.

Earlier this month, the company said it plans to reduce about 4% of its workforce, or about 9,000 people, the Seattle Times reported. That came after several other rounds of cuts in 2025.\n\nIn a message to employees last week, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella described the moves as part of the \u201cenigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd yet, at the same time, we\u2019ve undergone layoffs.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the layoffs certainly may raise eyebrows. It also carries reputational risks of its own. Rita McGrath, executive director of executive education at Columbia University, said that such moves are a \u201csymbolic disconnect of a massive degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat definitely could damage the culture,\u201d she said in an interview with CFO.com.\n\nThe wider tech industry\u2019s reported layoffs likely stem from a \u201creal arms race in the AI world,\u201d McGrath said. Tech businesses are also under pressure to show that their enormous investments in artificial intelligence tools are justified. Microsoft, for its part, plans to spend over $30 billion on total capex this quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s incumbent on CFOs, McGrath said, to explain to analysts and the wider business community the clear reasoning behind any strategic shifts. As an example, she pointed back to Adobe\u2019s switch from selling software on physical CDs to selling it through cloud subscriptions. Though the company\u2019s revenue dipped at the time, its market valuation grew, McGrath said. She attributed that to efforts the company\u2019s CFO made to explain the shift.\n\nFor now, though, analysts are still apparently betting high on Microsoft\u2019s \u201cAI transformation,\u201d as CFO Hood put it in her memo. In a research note, Raymond James analysts said that Microsoft had an \u201cunusually strong quarter with hardly anything to complain about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Azure stole the show, the strong performance was pervasive throughout the company\u2019s print,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSegment results, expense trends, and guidance were all excellent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, despite job cuts, Microsoft\u2019s total workforce has been ticking up within the last few fiscal years. According to annual securities filings, Microsoft employed 228,000 people worldwide as of June 30. The tech giant reported the exact same number in the prior year. As of June 2022, Microsoft said it employed 221,000 employees, up from 181,000 employees in the prior year.",

However, a leaked internal memo from CFO Amy Hood signaled that the upcoming fiscal year (FY26) will \"require intensity, clarity and bold execution\" with priorities in security, quality, and AI transformation. This comes as the company plans to reduce about 4% of its workforce, or 9,000 people, following several other rounds of cuts in 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:** Microsoft's significant layoffs are occurring despite its remarkable financial performance and a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAmerican businesses are losing millions in productivity each year, often with most CFOs not realizing it.\n\nThe analysis is from workforce productivity software provider ActivTrak\u2019s Workforce Utilization Benchmarks Report 2H 2025, which analyzed 5,619 organizations and 304,083 workers and found that companies operate at just 87% of expected productivity.\n\nAcross industries, this translates to the equivalent of 130 employees per 1,000 workers producing no output \u2014 or $11.2 million in wasted salary annually per 1,000 employees. For CFOs facing tight margins, talent shortages and pressure to optimize every dollar, the findings highlight how much value can be unlocked by keeping teams motivated and productive.\n\nThe hidden productivity gap and the state of work\n\nActivTrak CFO Jana Wilson told CFO.com the findings underscore a growing challenge not only for businesses operating in all types of work structures, but also for finance leaders trying to do more with smaller teams.\n\nJana Wilson Permission granted by Jana Wilson\n\n\u201cMany finance teams are operating leaner than ever because of talent shortages, and automation can only fill so much of the gap,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWorkforce utilization data shows leaders where they\u2019re getting the most out of their people and where capacity is being left on the table. That insight allows finance leaders to redeploy resources with precision instead of over-hiring or over-relying on technology without clear ROI.\u201d\n\nThe report found that nearly six in 10 (58%) employees fail to meet daily productivity goals. For Wilson, that was the most alarming finding.\n\n\u201cCFOs tend to assume their teams are operating at full capacity because financial results often mask underlying inefficiencies,\u201d she said. \u201cOur analysis shows there\u2019s significant untapped potential, particularly in back-office roles where contributions are harder to measure but critical to operations.\u201d\n\nEven small inefficiencies multiply at scale, according to the report: Organizations with 251 to 1,000 employees lose $1.3 million to $1.7 million annually, and enterprises with more than 1,000 employees see losses of $3.7 million to $3.9 million per year.\n\nIndustry comparisons reveal where the losses are concentrated. Computer hardware teams have nearly 71% of employees below productivity goals, the highest rate in the report. Aerospace organizations face the greatest untapped capacity at 19%, with average productivity losses of $1 million annually per company. On the other end, logistics organizations have the lowest rate of underperformance at 41% and the least untapped capacity at 9%.\n\n\u201cWorkforce utilization data provides a place to start and helps leaders see how time is being spent and whether activity is aligned with company priorities,\u201d Wilson said. Data also indicates that for finance leaders balancing lean teams and automation, the ability to pinpoint underutilization is key to avoiding common challenges in contemporary finance like poor hires or investments in technology that do not deliver ROI.\n\nHow CFOs can measure and respond\n\nWilson said CFOs should start with a simple approach to productivity measurement. \u201cFocus first on the work that directly ties to business outcomes \u2014 how much time is spent there versus low-value tasks? That alone can highlight where capacity might be misaligned,\u201d she said.\n\nShe cautioned that capturing accurate workforce data is difficult for CFOs if they don\u2019t have proper systems designed for it. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to collect this data or calculate productivity metrics consistently without a system built for it,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cWorkforce analytics tools make it easier to capture the right data objectively, but the real value comes from how you use it,\u201d she added. \u201cTreat productivity metrics like financial metrics: Track them consistently, benchmark them and use them to drive action, not just as a reporting exercise.\u201d\n\nWilson added that workforce insights can also support morale and engagement. \u201cHelp people see how their work contributes to the bigger picture, especially in back-office roles that don\u2019t always have a direct line to revenue,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBe transparent about the why behind decisions and use data to show teams how they\u2019re performing against benchmarks,\u201d she said. \u201cThat clarity builds trust and engagement. Finally, create space for feedback and recognition \u2014 when people feel heard and valued, they\u2019re more resilient during change.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nGiulio Rindi, CFO for commercial and new payment flows at Mastercard, has spent more than a decade leading the company\u2019s global growth across Europe, international markets and now its expansion into new payment technologies.\n\nAs CFOs know, as the payments landscape shifts, finance teams are expected to move faster, manage greater complexity and guide their companies through an unpredictable global economy. Rindi\u2019s role encompasses this, as he oversees the financial strategy behind Mastercard\u2019s efforts to modernize consumer and B2B payment flows, strengthen resilience and unlock new opportunities for the business.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, he reflects on the evolution of the CFO role, lessons from leading finance across multiple continents, how emerging payment trends are reshaping the finance function and managing the personal trade-offs that come with having a career path that has spanned the globe.\n\nGiulio Rindi\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Giulio Rindi\n\nCFO, commercial and new payment flows, Mastercard\n\nFirst CFO position: 2015\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nAmerican Express\n\nPirelli\n\nBDO\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nADAM ZAKI: Mastercard processes a huge amount of data. As a CFO, how do you ensure it\u2019s optimized and focus on what matters versus the noise?\n\nGIULIO RINDI: As far as financials and financial KPIs are concerned, we are very well organized and rely on very solid data sources, with consistency across the organization. When you are a global company, consistency is crucial.\n\nThe real opportunity for many organizations now is to combine financial KPIs with operational KPIs. The reality is you have your financials in your ERP, sales-related data in your CRM and operational datasets in different systems. Bringing it all together is complicated. To have it available in real time and in a user-friendly dashboard is even more challenging.\n\nThat\u2019s the next big opportunity for many organizations: Efficiently integrating financial and operational KPIs and connecting the dots across the business at 360 degrees. It\u2019s almost like a superpower to drive outcomes and efficient execution.\n\nWe, like other big corporations, have very good control of the finances. But when you add operational KPIs to the financials, you gain true actionable insights: Why do we see certain trends? Which operational aspects of the business do we need to optimize? What should we invest in? How do we go to the market faster?\n\nFor example, time-to-revenue is something we focus on a lot. You sign a deal with a customer after six, 12 or 18 months of negotiations, but then you might not see volumes or revenue materializing as per the business plan or contract terms.\n\nIn a global organization with thousands of sales and business development people signing deals, I want to know if those deals are being executed. The connection between financial and operational KPIs gives you real-time visibility and the ability to drive execution excellence.\n\nPayment modernization is a huge topic right now. Why do B2B payments still lag behind consumer payments in terms of speed and simplicity, and how can technology help close that gap?\n\nIn the consumer world, payments are now part of our daily lives. We have frictionless experiences, security and user-friendly digital interfaces. And then there is also an element of frequency \u2014 you\u2019re making certain payments often, and that smooths your experience and allows the industry to evolve faster.\n\nIn B2B payments, it\u2019s more complicated. There is more friction, and therefore the modernization you are talking about is needed and points to the significant opportunity in front of us.\n\nWe continue to invest in products and solutions that will make B2B payments and money movement domestically and internationally more efficient and frictionless.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one example: We have a proprietary virtual card solution that businesses can embed in their ERP systems. That is basically a way of managing payments directly through your ERP system. We are collaborating with key players in this space, as well as local ERPs, to make sure our solution is compatible and interoperable.\n\nTechnology like this can help CFOs and treasurers manage accounts payable more efficiently. If you embed a virtual card solution in your ERP, you can manage payments in an automated way, you can drive working capital optimization, you can have more control and you can optimize your credit lines and expense base.\n\nThese are the challenges we see corporations facing today globally, and our solutions are focused on making payments smarter and businesses stronger. I believe this is going to be the future.\n\nHow do you view emerging technologies like stablecoins, embedded finance and blockchain? Are they creating real efficiencies in finance today, or are they more about long-term strategic investment?\n\nI cannot really connect stablecoin to immediate efficiency within the finance function. What I can say is, of course, we are looking at stablecoins as a business. We\u2019re also looking at crypto and blockchain. We work with our tech partners to decide where to invest.\n\nIt goes back to capital allocation and investment prioritization. There are trends CFOs can\u2019t afford to miss. Finance needs to be on board. Stablecoins are one of those. We need to be there, we need to allocate capital and that\u2019s what we are doing. Then we will see how that technology will shape payments going forward.\n\nIt\u2019s about investment prioritization, capital allocation and staying in the race. We can do that as a company, which is both great and exciting.\n\nWhat is collaboration like with the other divisional CFOs at Mastercard? Do you reach out to them for insight, or is it more ad hoc?\n\nFirst and foremost, collaboration is all about personal relationships. For me, it\u2019s about creating genuine connections with other CFOs, whether it's other business unit CFOs, divisional CFOs or regional CFOs, but also with corporate functions such as FP&A, investor relations, real estate, sourcing, tax and controllership.\n\nBuilding those relationships over time is fundamental. You can have all the tools and knowledge you want, but without those relationships, you move slowly and inefficiently.\n\nSo in this case, it\u2019s not really about technology or processes. It\u2019s about the ability to connect at a personal level, to pick up the phone, to help your teams connect the dots. From there, you can develop tools or do ad hoc analysis, whether it\u2019s short-term or medium-to-long-term sustainable solutions.\n\nSometimes in organizations, things are done without that clarity. Maybe there\u2019s a business unit agenda or a personal agenda and you can\u2019t put it in context. For me, it\u2019s simple: Shareholder and stakeholder interests come first. That works across geographies and cultures.\n\nYou\u2019ve held leadership roles across the world, managing people from many different cultures and backgrounds. How has this experience helped you professionally?\n\nEvery time you change a company or a country, you need to adapt. There is an element of flexibility and adaptability.\n\nFirst, I think it\u2019s a privilege to be able to have all these opportunities. You need to be willing to embrace those because there is a price to pay from a personal standpoint. But it\u2019s very enriching \u2014 rewarding personally for your family, but also professionally.\n\nIt also comes with the responsibility of leading larger teams across different geographies with different cultural backgrounds. But I have found it extremely intellectually stimulating. It\u2019s helped me grow significantly because you face different mindsets, cultures and approaches.\n\nIt\u2019s all about super clear and crisp communication, a pragmatic approach, transparency and having the team\u2019s roles and responsibilities well defined. These are the key ingredients to support the delivery of the financial objectives and the execution of the strategy, and ultimately drive long-term sustainable shareholder value.\n\nYou mentioned earlier the personal trade-offs of having a global role. How have you balanced building your global career with being a good partner, parent and friend?\n\nI like to think of this like a stool with three legs. The legs are family, friends and professional career. Without one of those legs, you are unstable.\n\n\"I grew up in Rome, Italy, and didn\u2019t move for the first eighteen years of my life. Friends were everything for me, so I understand the value of stability and strong friendships. For my children, it\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s also enriching. They have a very unique perspective on the world now.\" Giulio Rindi CFO, Commerical and New Payment Flows, Mastercard\n\nLeaders often talk a lot about professional opportunity and growth. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the easy part. But family and social life are critical. Business leaders who embrace these types of professional journeys need to have a partner who supports them, the adventures that come with it, and must be willing to make some sacrifices themselves. It\u2019s not easy to change jobs and countries every three or four years.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed children are amazing at adapting. It\u2019s easier when they are younger, like 12 and under. It becomes more complicated and challenging for them after that. But again, it\u2019s a trade-off between giving them a broad perspective on the world versus more stability, which is also valuable.\n\nI grew up in Rome, Italy, and didn\u2019t move for the first 18 years of my life. Friends were everything for me, so I understand the value of stability and strong friendships. For my children, it\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s also enriching. They have a very unique perspective on the world now.\n\nFriendships are another fundamental aspect. I try to invest quality time in keeping in touch with old friends and building many new friendships throughout the journey, everywhere we live. It\u2019s a different dynamic, but it\u2019s incredible.\n\nWe live in a global world. We\u2019re all connected. It\u2019s easier now than when I left home. Back then, I didn\u2019t have an iPhone, a BlackBerry or even an email. Now it\u2019s easier to travel, easier to connect. So overall, it\u2019s a balancing act \u2014 a dance. You need all three legs of the stool to be very solid.",

Perhaps more than you thought.\n\nIn 2023, \u201cthe great stay\u201d trend developed when turnover was at a low rate. That followed a two-year period of \u201cthe great resignation,\u201d when employee churn hit a record high. And now, there are signs the job market may be shifting once again, with almost half (48%) of workers saying they\u2019re at least somewhat likely to search for a job by mid-2026, according to a June Bankrate survey of 1,005 people either working full time or seeking full-time employment. And 25% of them characterized themselves as \u201cvery likely\u201d to do so.\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of workers said their level of worry about their job security has worsened since January of this year, compared with 15% who said it has improved.\n\nIn fact, 26% of them said they're likely to start their own business by the middle of next year.\n\nIn another sign of a possible softening of the 2023-2024 employers\u2019 market, 44% of participants in the June survey said they're likely to ask for a raise within a year.\n\n\u201cAs the job market has normalized following the period a few years ago when it was widely described as red-hot, many workers are seeking better pay or new work,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate, a consumer financial services company.\n\nMore than a third (36%) of those surveyed reported being likely to ask for more flexibility with work hours and remote work. That marked a pullback from the previous year, when 42% of workers told Bankrate they\u2019d requested greater workplace flexibility.\n\nThe survey revealed that a worker\u2019s income level affects their likelihood of being in job-search mode. Those making less than $50,000 were unsurprisingly the most likely (58%) to search for a new job, while those earning between $50,000 and $79,999 followed at 47%.\n\nThe $80,000-$99,999 cohort continued the pattern at 29%. However, it reversed to 41% among those making at least $100,000.\n\nGenerationally, 53% of Gen Z workers (ages 18 to 28) are likely to look for a job, not much more than the 49% of Millennials (ages 29 to 44) and 48% of Gen X (ages 45 to 60) reported the same.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFinance leaders today are increasingly being asked to manage organizational change as much as they\u2019re asked to manage budgets.\n\nThat notion was reaffirmed by a recent survey conducted by Dallas-based professional services firm RGP. In a June survey of 63 CFOs at firms with more than $500 million in revenue, 74% of respondents reported \u201cincreased influence on enterprise-wide decisions.\u201d What\u2019s more, nearly all (93%) said they had \u201csignificant influence\u201d on business strategy, and nearly three quarters (73%) reported the same influence on tech investments.\n\nWhat sorts of investments are finance chiefs making these days? Per the RGP report, more than half of respondents (57%) say they\u2019re allocating capital in tech and \u201cdigital transformation\u201d initiatives, including artificial intelligence capabilities. The same share of respondents said they\u2019re allocating capital for \u201coperational efficiency initiatives\u201d intended to \u201cstreamline processes and protect margins in an uncertain economic climate.\u201d\n\nThe more tech-focused CFO of today is necessarily forming tighter relationships with CIOs and other technology leaders at their organizations, according to RGP.\n\n\u201cThe CFO\u2019s perspective is becoming more essential to the success of digital investment, AI strategy and overall enterprise transformation, and so we\u2019re seeing CFOs and CIOs work more closely together on technology investments and implementations,\u201d RGP CFO Jenn Ryu said in an email to CFO.com. \u201cIn fact, nine in 10 of the CFOs we surveyed said their partnership with their organization\u2019s CIO has become more strategic in the last two years.\"\n\nBy the numbers 74% of CFO respondents who reported \u201cincreased influence on enterprise-wide decisions\u201d 93% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d on business strategy 73% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d over technology investments 63% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d over go-to-market strategies\n\nPer the report, 84% of respondents said they\u2019re optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence, though actual investments in such tools remain relatively low. Less than half of respondents said they\u2019re committing more than 10% of their capital budgets to AI, RGP researchers found.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm around AI is certainly continuing to increase, but many businesses are still in the early stages of AI adoption,\u201d Ryu said. \u201cThe key barrier that organizations face is data readiness. Only 27% of CFOs report complete trust in the quality of their data, and only 19% report complete trust in the reliability of their data.\u201d\n\nIn the bigger picture, all these changes point to the fact that \u201ctoday\u2019s finance leader is stepping beyond spreadsheets to shape the future of the enterprise,\u201d RGP officials wrote in the report. \u201cWhat was once a role defined by accuracy and compliance is now centered on agility, influence and transformation.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not to say such changes have always gone smoothly. \u201cNot every finance leader is ready for this evolution,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe path forward demands fluency beyond finance \u2014 deep curiosity about people, processes and platforms. It requires emotional intelligence to lead through change and the humility to listen as much as lead.\u201d\n\nManaging change during mergers and acquisitions was another area of concern. While about half of respondents (49%) expect to engage in M&A activity before the year is over, the same share also acknowledged that \u201cchange management remains a significant weakness.\u201d\n\nAmid quickly shifting U.S. trade policy, the future of M&A, of course, remains an open question.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNvidia\u2019s unprecedented climb past a $4 trillion market cap this summer has not only set global valuation records, but has also made its CFO, Colette Kress, a billionaire.\n\nOn July 29, Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index listed Kress with a net worth exceeding $1 billion thanks largely to her equity holdings in the chipmaker. According to Bloomberg data, Kress owns or has options for more than 5.4 million Nvidia shares, worth roughly $1 billion at current prices.\n\nWhile valuations fluctuate with Nvidia\u2019s share price, the milestone places her in rare company. Fellow 10-figure net worth chief financial officers include former Oracle CFO and current CEO Safra Catz and Ineos CFO John Reece, who are among the few finance chiefs to have reached billionaire status.\n\nKress, who joined Nvidia in 2013 after senior finance roles at Cisco and Microsoft, has been a key figure in the company\u2019s AI-driven expansion beyond gaming processors into powering generative AI. During her 12-year tenure, Nvidia has become the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization and one of the most influential players in global technology markets and smart chip manufacturing.\n\nKress\u2019s wealth reflects how equity compensation has become the central driver of CFO net worth at hyper-growth tech companies. Unlike cash bonuses or short-term incentives, her stock grants vested for more than a decade.\n\nFor Nvidia, this compensation model extends well beyond the C-suite. The company\u2019s stock performance has created thousands of employees who are multi-millionaires, mirroring what happened with the equity awards for employees at Microsoft, Google and Apple during their early growth waves. While this makes for a motivated workforce, it can also complicate recruiting and retention once money is no longer a differentiator, a challenge companies like Meta have recently seen in their AI recruitment tactics.\n\nNvidia\u2019s compensation model highlights a potential long-term issue for finance chiefs at high-growth technology companies: As equity values grow, how do you keep incentivizing employees who already have achieved substantial personal wealth?\n\nCFOs at publicly traded companies are currently the youngest they have been in six years and have the highest turnover rate in the same timeframe. As equity-based compensation at fast-growing technology companies now results in higher-paid leaders, retaining executives who do not see a billion-dollar future at the company may also be difficult if opportunities elsewhere, particularly in technology, grow.\n\nKress\u2019s inclusion in Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index also underscores the central role CFOs now play in shaping company performance and the broader employee experience and corporate culture. For Nvidia, the rise of its now billionaire CFO is a direct reflection of the company\u2019s AI-driven market dominance and a reminder of the complex human capital challenges that accompany such rapid growth.",

Her net worth surpassed $1 billion primarily due to her equity holdings, which include over 5.4 million Nvidia shares or options. This milestone places her among a small group of finance chiefs to reach billionaire status, alongside figures like Safra Catz and John Reece.\n\n**Why it matters:** Kress's wealth reflects equity compensation as the central driver of CFO net worth at hyper-growth tech companies. This compensation model, which created thousands of multi-millionaire employees at Nvidia, presents a long-term challenge. It raises the question of how to incentivize employees and retain executives once substantial personal wealth is achieved, potentially challenging the assumption that high equity awards alone ensure continued motivation and loyalty.\n\n**The big picture:** Nvidia's unprecedented ascent past a $4 trillion market cap this summer has positioned it as the most valuable U.S. company.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSiena Heights University, a century-old Catholic institution in Adrian, Michigan, has quietly settled a whistleblower lawsuit with its former CFO Debi Andrews. The settlement comes weeks after announcing it will permanently close following the 2025\u20132026 academic year.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April 2025 in federal court, alleged Andrews was terminated in retaliation for refusing to misrepresent budget details to the university\u2019s board and for encouraging a colleague to file a sexual harassment complaint against university president Douglas Palmer. The settlement terms have not been made public, and neither party has commented on the outcome.\n\nAndrews, who joined the university in February 2024, claimed she uncovered serious financial irregularities, including questionable budget proposals, misuse of fundraising dollars by athletic staff and instances of personal expenses being improperly classified as student-related. According to court documents, her opposition to Palmer\u2019s proposed budget and internal concerns about transparency preceded her being placed on unpaid leave that summer.\n\nThe complaint also accused the school\u2019s then-HR director Fran Johnson of spreading false allegations about Andrews that claimed she was having inappropriate relations with staff in campus facilities, which were later used as the basis for what Andrews described as a retaliatory internal investigation.\n\nSiena Heights declined to comment to MLive on the specifics of the case but previously stated all personnel decisions were made following a \u201cthorough and careful review\u201d and that it remained committed to a respectful and accountable workplace culture.\n\nThe legal battle has unfolded in parallel with the university\u2019s financial unraveling. In June, Siena Heights announced plans to shut down operations after the current academic year, citing enrollment declines, demographic shifts and rising costs. With roughly 1,700 undergraduates and fewer than 200 graduate students, the school will continue to operate through the 2025\u20132026 academic year while preparing for closure.\n\nFounded in 1919 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, Siena Heights has been deeply connected to the Catholic community in southeastern Michigan for over a hundred years. The Sisters, who remain its stewards, have evolved into major philanthropic and impact investment players, financing climate and social justice projects and leading shareholder advocacy campaigns supported by institutions like BlackRock.\n\nThis investing approach is not unique to the Sisters and is a part of a larger challenge the entire religious institution is currently grappling with. The college\u2019s closure also places Siena Heights among at least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges that have closed, merged or begun wind-downs since 2020.\n\nTo support students affected by the shutdown, Ashland University in Ohio has stepped in to offer credit transfer guarantees, financial aid counseling and academic advising as the schools work to formalize a partnership. The case highlights the increasing exposure CFOs face at struggling institutions, particularly in education, where financial transparency and governance breakdowns can become legal headaches.",

This settlement comes weeks after the university announced its permanent closure following the 2025\u20132026 academic year. Andrews' lawsuit, filed in April 2025, alleged retaliatory termination for refusing to misrepresent budget details and encouraging a sexual harassment complaint against the university president. She claimed to have uncovered financial irregularities, including questionable budget proposals and misuse of fundraising dollars. The settlement terms have not been made public, and neither party has commented on the outcome.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis legal battle unfolded in parallel with the university's financial unraveling, highlighting deeper governance issues beyond stated external factors. The case underscores the increasing exposure CFOs face at struggling institutions, particularly in the education sector. It suggests that financial transparency and governance breakdowns can become significant legal headaches, exacerbating institutional challenges. This potentially challenges a view that struggles in the education sector are solely due to external factors like demographics or costs, instead pointing to internal operational and ethical lapses.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSiena Heights University, a century-old Catholic institution founded in 1919, announced in June its plans to shut down operations. The university cited enrollment declines, demographic shifts, and rising costs as reasons for its closure. Its closure places Siena Heights among at least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges that have closed, merged, or begun wind-downs since 2020. The Adrian Dominican Sisters, who are its stewards, are also involved in philanthropic and impact investment, an approach which is part of a larger challenge facing religious institutions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Founded in 1919.\n*   Roughly 1,700 undergraduates and fewer than 200 graduate students.\n*   Lawsuit filed in April 2025.\n*   University to permanently close after the 2025\u20132026 academic year.\n*   At least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges have closed, merged, or begun wind-downs since 2020.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Siena Heights University:** Century-old Catholic institution that settled a whistleblower lawsuit and plans to permanently close.\n*   **Debi Andrews:** Former CFO who filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging retaliatory termination against the university.\n*   **Douglas Palmer:** University president accused in the lawsuit of proposing a questionable budget and being subject of a harassment complaint.\n*   **Fran Johnson:** Then-HR director accused of spreading false allegations about Andrews to justify a retaliatory investigation.\n*   **Adrian Dominican Sisters:** Founders and stewards of Siena Heights, now major philanthropic and impact investment players.\n*   **MLive:** News organization to which Siena Heights declined to comment on the specifics of the case.\n*   **BlackRock:** Institution that supports the shareholder advocacy campaigns led by the Adrian Dominican Sisters.\n*   **Ashland University:** Ohio university offering credit transfer guarantees and advising to Siena Heights students.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nSiena Heights closure marked by financial and governance claims, highlighting wider education sector risks.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFor CFOs who operate globally and are looking for ways to keep their people engaged, EY suggests that moving people across borders can be a viable option.\n\nThe 2025 EY Mobility Reimagined Survey, based on responses from more than 1,000 global mobility professionals and employees, explores how organizations are adapting their mobility functions to meet these challenges. The findings point to a growing divide between companies that treat mobility as a strategic asset and those that see it as an administrative task.\n\nThe most advanced organizations, referred to in the survey as having \u201cevolved\u201d mobility functions \u2014 a strong, multifaceted approach to relocating team members to new locations \u2014 are leveraging technology, outsourcing and cross-functional alignment to drive retention and efficiency. As CFOs face continued cost pressures and workforce constraints, mobility, though a bit costly on the front-end, is emerging as a critical lever for employee retention, development and growth.\n\nEffective vs. evolved mobility functions\n\nWorkforce mobility has traditionally been a back-office function focused on compliance and logistics. But that\u2019s changing fast, as EY researchers report that mobility is now being asked to solve some of the most pressing business challenges: filling senior roles, managing cross-border risk and retaining key talent. Yet only a small group of companies are getting it right, largely because their mobility functions are \u201ceffective\u201d but not \u201cevolved.\u201d\n\nNinety percent of employers agree mobility should align with broader talent and organizational goals, but less than a third (30%) have achieved that alignment. The result is a growing divide between companies with evolved mobility functions and those still operating in isolation.\n\nThese evolved programs are still fundamentally about relocating employees across borders, but unlike the processes of effective mobility functions, decisions are made in a way that encompasses strategy and data from across the business. They\u2019re more likely to personalize the relocation experience, track outcomes like ROI and retention and streamline complex tasks like immigration or tax compliance through outsourcing and automation.\n\nResearch indicates evolved programs are 3.7 times more likely to say mobility helps solve medium-term talent shortages and 1.8 times more likely to report that mobility supports business growth. More than half of employers say it now takes over a year to fill senior positions, underscoring the urgency for better talent deployment and employee retention strategies.\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s role in mobility\n\nEY research suggests generative AI is changing what workforce mobility can deliver. The number of mobility professionals using generative AI in their daily work rose from 22% to 35% in the past year, according to EY. Among companies with evolved mobility programs, adoption is even higher, with leaders using the technology to streamline immigration processes, flag compliance risks early and generate faster, more personalized employee support.\n\nThis transformation is changing how mobility functions operate and how they are valued by the business. Companies with more advanced programs are nearly three times more likely to increase investment in technology to help support employee mobility. By doing this and with the help of generative AI tools, these teams are more likely to track outcomes like post-assignment promotions, time to fill open roles and the revenue impact of relocation decisions.\n\nThey are also better at anticipating risk. EY found that evolved programs are 1.8 times more likely to have avoided business disruption, such as canceling or delaying a market expansion, because their mobility systems flagged immigration or regulatory issues before they became costly.\n\nFor CFOs, these capabilities offer more than efficiency. They turn mobility into a strategic function that supports growth, protects margins and helps make the most of every headcount investment.\n\nMobility may offer the growth Gen Z employees are looking for\n\nWhile the survey doesn\u2019t focus specifically on generational trends, the results strongly reflect what younger workers, particularly Gen Z, say they want from employers: personalized growth opportunities, meaningful experiences and flexibility in how and where they work.\n\nEY found that a large portion (85%) of employees describe mobility assignments as life-changing, and nearly half say they\u2019re more likely to stay with a company that offers them. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of employers include mobility in their total rewards framework, but evolved functions are 3.4 times more likely to be updating those rewards to reflect employee expectations. In a tight labor market, that kind of customization could make a measurable difference in retention and engagement.\n\nAt the same time, 96% of mobility professionals say they\u2019re focused on cost reduction. The most effective strategies include vendor consolidation, targeted outsourcing and better use of digital tools. Evolved programs are seeking twice as many cost-saving measures as basic ones, and are twice as likely to have fully automated or outsourced processes.\n\nThe takeaway EY is driving home to finance leaders is clear: Mobility can no longer be a circumstantial, siloed HR function. When aligned with strategy, powered by technology and tailored to today\u2019s workforce, it becomes a lever for retention, resilience and long-term value for the organization\u2019s future human capital.",

Silanskas Jr., Larry K. Wilhite and Stephen D. Hedrick of Mansion Entertainment Group stole $60 million and caused him severe distress that led to a stroke last year.\n\nThe suit, which asks for the investment back along with other fees, includes texts and emails from Silanskas and Wilhite impersonating messages from God.\n\n\u201cSilanskas and Wilhite executed a predatory conspiracy of psychological manipulation \u2014 convincing Gene, through fraud and impersonation, that God himself was commanding him both to finance the park\u2019s construction and to grant Silanskas and Wilhite two-thirds ownership over the completed venture,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nDeveloper Mansion Entertainment Group announced in July 2023 designs for the 1,000-acre Americana-themed development, including roller coasters, an indoor water park, a 300-room hotel and an RV park. The footprint of the 125-acre theme portion would rival Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, in size.\n\nAt the time, Hedrick commented publicly that Bicknell was the sole financial backer, per the suit.\n\n\u201cThe plan was to use Gene\u2019s money to build the American Heartland Project and then steal it, paying themselves handsomely along the way,\u201d the suit reads. \u201cSilanskas already had a record of involvement in failed theme park projects that left empty-handed investors in their wake.\u201d\n\nThe RV area was originally scheduled to open in spring 2025, followed by the theme park and resort in fall 2026. Indeed, the RV area broke ground in 2023 but nothing more has been built besides a fence and a gravel road, according to the suit. Developers claimed that their design team includes former Disney Parks builders and Walt Disney Imagineers, but that was also a lie, the suit alleges.\n\n\u201cThe groundbreaking was essentially the beginning and the end of the construction work on the entire Project,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cInnocent people lost money by buying up land near Vinita with property values inflated by news of a theme park that would never exist.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the project has been sued. Canadian design firm Forrec and Columbus, Kansas-based Crossland Construction both filed claims in May 2024 alleging that they were not paid for their work. At least five lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed by vendors, according to Bicknell\u2019s suit.\n\nMansion Entertainment Group did not respond to Construction Dive's request for comment on the lawsuit.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWithout more technology adoption, the construction industry\u2019s delivery of data centers could fall short even as global demand for artificial intelligence intensifies, according to a new white paper.\n\nUnless building methods evolve to match the scale and speed required for these complex jobs, contractors may not be able to keep up with client needs, says the report from Revitzo , a Swiss construction software provider.\n\nCurrently, the construction sector is struggling to keep pace, putting both infrastructure delivery and broader economic ambitions at risk, the paper found.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nGlobally, capital expenditure on data centers is expected to surpass $1 trillion annually by 2029, according to Redwood City, California-based market research firm Dell\u2019Oro Group. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are expected to spend over $300 billion this year alone on data centers and compute power.\n\nTechnology adoption remains a critical barrier to the delivery of these projects, according to Revizto research, which found that many construction teams still rely on static, nonintegrated tools even for complex and fast-moving projects. The firm said 27% of global AEC professionals use email, spreadsheets and PDFs as their primary digital tools.\n\nHowever, data center construction demands complex coordination, massive datasets, strict regulatory compliance, high-stakes communication and tight timeframes, with some projects now moving from concept to full design in as little as 10 weeks, according to the white paper.\n\n\"The construction industry can't keep pace with demand using static tools like Excel and PDFs,\u201d said Revizto CEO Arman Gukasyan in a news release. \u201cIf we're serious about meeting the demands of modern data center builds, we need a fundamental shift in how we deliver the physical infrastructure that supports them.\"\n\nBeyond technology adoption, U.S. contractors are finding creative ways to meet the demand for data center development. For instance, contractors are consulting with clients on projects earlier than ever in the process to help evaluate site conditions, entitlement risks, energy procurement and utility interconnection timelines.\n\n\u201cPreconstruction services and capabilities have become a true differentiator,\u201d John Arcello, advanced technology core market co-leader at Redwood City, California-based general contractor DPR, told Construction Dive earlier this year. \u201cEarly engagement is critical to stay on track.\u201d\n\nContractors also are turning to prefabrication more aggressively. On remote sites, Arcello said teams are increasingly building components offsite in labor-rich regions and transporting them to projects. That helps ease skilled trade constraints and minimize rework, he said.\n\nIke Keene, vice president of commercial at Caddell Construction, a Montgomery, Alabama-based general contractor, said that the need for accurate cost forecasting has grown significantly. That\u2019s especially true as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add a fresh layer of volatility to material prices.\n\n\u201cThe newly adopted tariffs have become a new variable in cost control,\u201d said Keene earlier this year. \u201cWe are adapting day by day for accurate current and future pricing structures to aid our clients in forecasting for the future.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Construction's Tech Lag Threatens Data Center Delivery Amid AI Boom\n\n**Key details:** The construction industry is struggling to keep pace with data center delivery, even as global AI demand intensifies. A new white paper from Revizto indicates insufficient technology adoption is a critical barrier, with 27% of global AEC professionals using static tools like email and PDFs. This challenge puts infrastructure delivery and broader economic ambitions at risk. Some projects demand concept-to-design completion in 10 weeks. Contractors are adapting by engaging clients earlier and using prefabrication.\n\n**Why it matters:** Global demand for artificial intelligence is intensifying, driving significant capital expenditure on data centers, projected to exceed $1 trillion annually by 2029. Major tech companies plan to spend over $300 billion this year on data centers and compute power. However, the construction industry's struggle to adopt advanced technology means delivery could fall short, challenging the assumption that high spending alone will ensure timely infrastructure. This bottleneck in physical construction could jeopardize economic ambitions tied to AI growth. The reliance on outdated tools by a significant portion of professionals highlights a critical, often overlooked, impediment to this rapid expansion.\n\n**The big picture:** The broader context is the booming global demand for artificial intelligence, which necessitates a massive increase in data center infrastructure. The construction industry is responsible for delivering these complex data centers. However, current building methods are not evolving quickly enough to meet the required scale and speed. This inability to keep pace with client needs poses a risk to infrastructure delivery. The challenge extends to broader economic ambitions that rely on this foundational digital infrastructure.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Global data center capital expenditure: Expected to surpass $1 trillion annually by 2029.\n*   Tech giants' 2023 spending: Over $300 billion on data centers and compute power.\n*   AEC professionals using static tools: 27% globally use email, spreadsheets, and PDFs.\n*   Fastest project timelines: Some move from concept to full design in 10 weeks.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Revizto:** Swiss construction software provider, whose white paper highlights industry tech adoption issues.\n*   **Dell\u2019Oro Group:** Market research firm based in Redwood City, forecasting future data center capital expenditure.\n*   **Microsoft:** Tech giant expected to spend significantly on data centers and compute power.\n*   **Google:** Tech giant expected to spend significantly on data centers and compute power.\n*   **Amazon:** Tech giant expected to spend significantly on data centers and compute power.\n*   **Meta:** Tech giant expected to spend significantly on data centers and compute power.\n*   **Arman Gukasyan:** Revizto CEO, stressed the need for a fundamental shift in infrastructure delivery methods.\n*   **DPR:** General contractor adapting by consulting clients earlier and using prefabrication.\n*   **John Arcello:** DPR co-leader, emphasized early engagement and preconstruction as key differentiators.\n*   **Caddell Construction:** General contractor facing challenges with accurate cost forecasting due to tariffs.\n*   **Ike Keene:** Caddell Construction VP, discussed adapting to new tariff variables affecting material prices.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President whose tariffs are adding a layer of volatility to material prices.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Construction's tech lag could impede critical data center expansion for AI.",

Russell and Co. with about 10 years of experience in project management. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nIn the land of cranes, concrete and compounding delays, a quiet crisis looms over America\u2019s skylines: We don\u2019t have enough people to build them.\n\nDespite billions in infrastructure spending, a housing crisis demanding millions of new units and booming demand for data centers and clean energy facilities, the U.S. construction industry finds itself paralyzed by a labor shortage that isn\u2019t just cyclical \u2014 it\u2019s structural.\n\nBut where are the workers?\n\nIn the first place, construction depends on a pipeline that no longer exists.\n\nVocational education has been stripped from many public schools. Immigration, once the backbone of America\u2019s building trades, is mired in policy gridlock. Meanwhile, contractors haven\u2019t figured out how to recruit members of the younger generation, who are much different than previous generations when it comes to their attitudes, values and work styles.\n\nRatan Lal Permission granted by Ratan Lal\n\nToday, about 245,000 construction jobs remain unfilled, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nearly one in four workers is over the age of 55, and retirements are accelerating. The industry is bleeding institutional knowledge and struggling to attract replacements. And while robots and prefabrication can help, they are no match for the deep cultural and policy fractures that caused this shortage.\n\nWe must confront the elephant on the jobsite: Immigration reform is not just a border issue, it\u2019s a construction issue. About one-fourth of construction labor in the U.S. is foreign-born, and the share is even higher in trades like concrete, roofing and framing.\n\nSkilled immigrant workers sit in limbo due to outdated visa caps and restrictive pathways. If the U.S. is serious about building back better, it must first build smarter immigration systems: trade-specific visas, cross-border credentialing and partnerships with vocational schools abroad.\n\nDEI: An untapped reservoir\n\nLet\u2019s address another blind spot: diversity.\n\nOnly 11% of construction workers are women, according to the BLS. Black workers make up about 5%. LGBTQ+ representation and support remain almost invisible. Yet, we talk about labor shortages as if it\u2019s a supply problem, not a systemic exclusion problem.\n\nThe myth that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to work in construction\u201d ignores the lived reality of millions who were never welcomed in the first place.\n\nImagine instead an industry designed around working mothers, second-chance citizens, rural talent, neurodivergent problem-solvers and veterans.\n\nTo fix the labor shortage, the industry must first fix itself. That means real investment in community college trade programs, wraparound childcare, inclusive mentorship and pay equity. Not performative DEI, but foundational transformation.\n\nConstruction has long suffered from boom-bust cycles. When markets tighten, training is the first to go. Subcontractors churn. Apprenticeships are delayed. It\u2019s a recipe for fragility. The shift must be from cost-first to capacity-first planning.\n\nPublic owners, from city transit agencies to federal infrastructure programs, should mandate workforce development spending on every capital project. Private equity in real estate must tie return on investment to long-term labor investment.\n\nWe need to treat skilled labor not as a commodity, but a strategic asset.\n\nA blueprint for the future\n\nSolving the labor shortage in construction isn\u2019t about tweaking around the edges. It\u2019s about a new blueprint \u2014 one that recognizes:\n\nImmigration is workforce development.\n\nDEI is not a side initiative, it is labor market expansion.\n\nLabor policy must be proactive, not project based.\n\nCulture change is not optional, it\u2019s existential.\n\nIt\u2019s time to modernize the image of construction\n\nIf we do this right, construction could become the beating heart of inclusive American growth. Not just building buildings but building futures. Because the question isn\u2019t just \u201cWhere are the workers?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cWhat are we doing to bring them back?\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

        "summary": "**Stanley Black & Decker to Hike Prices Again Amid Tariff Pressures, Margin Focus**\n\n**Key details:** Stanley Black & Decker plans a new, \"more modest\" round of price increases starting in Q4, following high single-digit hikes in April. This strategy aims to combat ongoing tariff costs, which the company initially expected to be as high as $1.7 billion but have since eased. SBD is also adjusting its supply chain to mitigate tariffs and is on track for $2 billion in total cost savings by the end of 2025, with $150 million achieved in Q2. The company's goal is to achieve 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the economic backdrop.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters as Stanley Black & Decker plans further price increases, yet saw no noticeable \"shift in buying trends\" after April hikes, signaling relatively healthy demand. Management believes Q2 was the \"low point for gross margins,\" suggesting expected improvement in coming quarters, which could challenge assumptions of prolonged margin compression. The company's significant efforts to reduce China production to under 5% by 2026 and leverage its North American footprint indicate a major supply chain reconfiguration. These actions aim to improve profitability and service despite ongoing tariff volatility and an uncertain economic backdrop.\n\n**The big picture:** Stanley Black & Decker, the world\u2019s largest toolmaker, operates amidst ongoing tariff volatility disrupting trade and commerce. The company's business primarily consists of its tools and outdoor division, which accounts for about 90% of total revenue. It also includes an engineered fastening division supplying manufacturers. This strategic pivot occurs as CEO Donald Allan transitions to executive chairman, with Christopher Nelson taking over as CEO in October.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Cost reduction program:** On track for $2 billion in total savings by end of 2025.\n*   **Q2 gross margin:** 27%, a 140 basis point decline from last year.\n*   **Q2 net earnings:** $101.9 million, compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n*   **Forecasted 2025 gross tariff cost impact:** $800 million, excluding mitigation efforts.\n*   **Expected negative earnings per share impact for 2025:** 65 cents, after mitigation.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Stanley Black & Decker:** World\u2019s largest toolmaker, implementing new price hikes and cost reduction program.\n*   **Christopher Nelson:** COO, named CEO successor; discussed price increases, margin targets, and supply chain adjustments.\n*   **Donald Allan:** CEO, transitioning to executive chairman; stated Q2 was likely low point for gross margins.\n*   **Patrick Hallinan:** CFO; provided updated forecast for 2025 tariff cost impact and EPS headwinds.\n*   **U.S. administration:** Engaged by SBD on trade-related goals and challenges to mitigate tariffs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Implementation of the \"more modest\" round of price increases starting in the fourth quarter.\n*   Donald Allan's transition to executive chairman, effective October, with Christopher Nelson becoming CEO.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** SBD leverages price hikes, supply chain changes for margin recovery amid tariffs.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Senate late Saturday confirmed Sean Cairncross, a veteran Republican political operative with close ties to the Trump administration, to become the country\u2019s third national cyber director, setting up a test of how tightly the president\u2019s advisers will try to control cybersecurity policy from the White House.\n\nCairncross, a former chief operating officer and legal adviser at the Republican National Committee, served as the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation during Trump\u2019s first term. He does not have significant technology or cybersecurity expertise, although he told senators during his confirmation hearing that he had helped public and private organizations respond to cyberattacks. As head of the relatively new Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), he will have a significant opportunity to put his stamp on how the Trump administration approaches a wide range of cyber challenges.\n\nSenators voted 59-35 to confirm him.\n\n\u201cAs the cyber strategic environment continues to evolve, we must ensure our policy efforts and capabilities deliver results for our national security and the American people,\u201d Cairncross said in a statement shared by his new office. \u201cThe United States must dominate the cyber domain through strong collaboration across departments and agencies, as well as private industry. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will enter a new era of effective cybersecurity policy.\u201d\n\nCongress created ONCD in 2021 to serve as the president's chief adviser on cyber defense issues. During the Biden administration, the office led projects on growing the cyber workforce, improving open-source software security, protecting vulnerable critical infrastructure communities like K-12 schools, securing new energy technology, and streamlining cyber regulations. It also promoted closer government ties with security researchers, encouraged infrastructure projects to prioritize cybersecurity and championed work to secure space systems, internet routing technology and post-quantum cryptography.\n\nCairncross will have to decide which, if any, of those projects to continue and which new ones to launch. He has said little about where he will focus his office\u2019s attention, although he is likely to prioritize regulatory harmonization, given Republicans\u2019 complaints \u2014 echoed by the business community \u2014 that there are too many overlapping cyber rules. At his confirmation hearing, Cairncross promised to meet regularly with industry executives to understand how the government could help them.\n\nONCD\u2019s workforce grew steadily during the Biden administration as its leaders tried to make it an authoritative voice on cyber matters within the government. But tensions between the office and the National Security Council (NSC) limited ONCD\u2019s influence and even led to the resignation of the first national cyber director. Under Cairncross, the office could staff up again and push for greater authority.\n\nHacking back\n\nCairncross\u2019s most emphatic comments on cybersecurity have involved offensive cyber operations, a topic that is outside of ONCD\u2019s portfolio. At his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly argued that the U.S. could stem a growing tide of cyberattacks by hacking its adversaries to put them on notice. His focus on offensive activities represents a sharp departure from the vision of his Biden-era predecessors. But Cairncross\u2019s views are likely to win him allies on Trump\u2019s NSC cyber team, which is stocked with proponents of hacking back. Those relationships could help Cairncross avoid bureaucratic tensions and raise ONCD\u2019s profile within the administration and in the public eye.\n\nWarm reception\n\nLeading national security experts have praised Cairncross for his management experience, relationship-building acumen and ability to \u201crespond to rapidly evolving political dynamics shaping policy conversations at the highest levels of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSean\u2019s leadership, experience, and commitment to public service will be vital to [ONCD\u2019s] growth into the center of gravity for cyber strategy, planning, coordination, and response,\u201d Frank Cilluffo, director of Auburn University\u2019s McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, said in a statement after Cairncross\u2019s confirmation.\n\nJason Oxman, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a leading tech trade group, encouraged Cairncross to \u201cfocus on a strategic, coordinated approach to U.S. cyber policy\u201d and to push for the reauthorization of the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.",

However, tensions between ONCD and the National Security Council (NSC) limited the office\u2019s influence, even leading to a resignation. Under Cairncross, the office could staff up again and push for greater authority, potentially increasing its profile within the administration.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   U.S. Senate voted 59-35 to confirm Sean Cairncross.\n*   He is the country\u2019s third national cyber director.\n*   Congress created ONCD in 2021.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Sean Cairncross:** Confirmed as national cyber director, set to influence Trump administration cyber policy.\n*   **U.S. Senate:** Voted to confirm Sean Cairncross as the new national cyber director.\n*   **Trump administration:** Cairncross has close ties and will lead cyber policy under its direction.\n*   **Republican National Committee:** Cairncross served as former chief operating officer and legal adviser.\n*   **Millennium Challenge Corporation:** Cairncross served as CEO during Trump's first term.\n*   **Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD):** New office Cairncross will head, created by Congress.\n*   **Biden administration:** ONCD led cyber projects during this period, preceding Cairncross's appointment.\n*   **National Security Council (NSC):** Experienced tensions with ONCD; Trump's team supports offensive cyber.\n*   **Frank Cilluffo:** Praised Cairncross for his leadership, experience, and commitment to public service.\n*   **Auburn University\u2019s McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security:** Its director praised Cairncross's leadership qualities.\n*   **Jason Oxman:** Encouraged Cairncross to pursue a strategic, coordinated approach to U.S. cyber policy.\n*   **Information Technology Industry Council:** Its president encouraged Cairncross on U.S. cyber policy direction.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Cairncross will decide which existing ONCD projects to continue and which new ones to launch.\n*   He is expected to prioritize regulatory harmonization and meet regularly with industry executives.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew cyber director signals a shift to offensive cyber and regulatory changes.",

The government claimed Illumina lacked an adequate security program and knowingly failed to incorporate cybersecurity into product design. Illumina denied knowingly selling defective products, and the agreement includes no admissions of guilt. The company stated it decided to settle due to the \"uncertainty, expense and distraction\" of litigation and that it successfully remediated the issues from 2022 to 2024.\n\n**Why it matters:** This settlement underscores the Department of Justice's commitment to holding federal contractors accountable for adhering to cybersecurity standards, especially when handling sensitive information like genetic data. For investors, this event reveals a significant compliance and operational risk for Illumina, a company described as dominant with roughly 80% global market share, as it highlights a period of alleged long-standing security failures in its products sold to the government. This information could challenge a perception of Illumina as an entirely unblemished or fully compliant supplier in critical federal markets.\n\n**The big picture:** The case originated from a whistleblower, Erica Lenore, a former director at Illumina, who provided details about the company's alleged noncompliance. Previous warnings regarding Illumina's software vulnerabilities were issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2022. This settlement aligns with a broader Department of Justice focus on cybersecurity for federal contractors, as evidenced by a separate $1.75 million settlement with Aero Turbine Inc. and Galant Capital Partners.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* $9.8 million: Settlement amount paid by Illumina to the Department of Justice.\n* 2016-2023: Period during which Illumina allegedly sold systems with vulnerabilities to federal agencies.\n* 80%: Illumina's approximate share of the global genomic-sequencing market.\n* $1.9 million: Amount whistleblower Erica Lenore will receive from the settlement.\n* $1.75 million: Settlement amount with defense contractor Aero Turbine Inc. and private equity firm Galant Capital Partners.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* Department of Justice (DOJ): Announced the $9.8 million settlement with Illumina over cybersecurity allegations.\n* Illumina: Genomic-sequencing system company that settled with the DOJ for alleged software vulnerabilities.\n* Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate: DOJ Civil Division official emphasizing accountability for federal contractors' cybersecurity.\n* Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Issued a 2023 warning about a vulnerability in Illumina software.\n* Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA): Warned in 2022 about a flaw in Illumina\u2019s Local Run Manager software.\n* Erica Lenore: Former Illumina director and whistleblower who received $1.9 million from the settlement.\n* Aero Turbine Inc.: Defense contractor that settled for $1.75 million over cybersecurity claims with the DOJ.\n* Galant Capital Partners: Private equity firm that settled for $1.75 million over cybersecurity claims with the DOJ.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Dominant genomic company settles cybersecurity claims, highlighting federal compliance risks.",

But in April 2025, even before LockBit\u2019s final demise, RansomHub itself shut down. \u201cThe precise circumstances behind its disappearance remain unclear,\u201d Check Point researchers wrote, \u201cbut the impact on the ransomware ecosystem was immediate.\u201d\n\nRansomHub affiliates, which had been posting an average of 75 new victims every month in the six-month period leading up to the group\u2019s shutdown, needed a new partner. Many of them appear to have found that partner in Qilin, whose activity nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2025, from an average of 35 victims per month to almost 70, according to Check Point.\n\nQilin has demonstrated longevity, operating since 2022, and its activities after the demise of RansomHub help illustrate why: It knows when to capitalize on its competitors\u2019 misfortunes. After RansomHub went offline, Qilin began advertising its attack toolkit\u2019s \u201cenhanced features,\u201d Check Point said, including \u201cnew integrated DDoS capabilities and [victim] negotiation consultations.\u201d\n\nDragonForce, another major ransomware-as-a-service group, likewise tried to capitalize on RansomHub\u2019s demise, claiming that the group had migrated to DragonForce\u2019s platform. Check Point\u2019s data shows a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in DragonForce victim reporting in April and June, but the company said it was unclear if this represented a sustained trend or a momentary blip.\n\nDespite the changing threat-actor landscape, some aspects of the ransomware ecosystem remain the same, according to Check Point\u2019s report. The United States accounts for roughly half of all reported victims, with the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada each accounting for 5%. But some groups \u201cexhibit distinct geographic preferences,\u201d Check Point noted, including Safepay, which focused disproportionately on Germany, and Akira, which focused on Italy.",

The ISACs urged their members to develop multichannel verification methods, which are designed to make sure a password reset or other request is coming from a real employee.\n\nMore sensitive requests, such as large financial transfers, should require multiple layers of approvals to prevent theft, the ISACs said.\n\nAfter debuting on the cybercrime scene in 2023, Scattered Spider experienced a resurgence earlier this year as it launched a months-long hacking campaign that ensnared companies ranging from British department store Marks & Spencer to Whole Foods distributor United Natural Foods and Australian airline Qantas.\n\nAccording to Google researchers, however, the group has gone quiet in recent weeks following the arrest of four suspected members for allegedly hacking three major British retailers. They caution that Scattered Spider has previously taken a step back following high profile arrests only to later resume activities.\n\nResearchers have also cautioned that threat groups either affiliated or inspired by Scattered Spider have used similar tactics.",

        "summary": "**Cyber Gang Scattered Spider Poses Evolving, Persistent Threat to Industries**\n\n**Key details:**\nA coalition of information-sharing groups (ISACs) urged members to mitigate attacks by the cybercrime gang Scattered Spider, following a similar warning from the FBI and CISA. The group is known for its evolving social-engineering tactics, primarily tricking IT help desks to gain credentials or bypass multifactor authentication. ISACs advised organizations to implement multichannel verification and multi-layer approvals for sensitive financial transfers. While the group has recently gone quiet, researchers caution it has historically resumed activities after high-profile arrests.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information matters because Scattered Spider is constantly innovating, directly challenging the efficacy of existing security measures by finding new ways to evade them. Its successful exploitation of IT help desks and multifactor authentication indicates that current defense protocols may be insufficient. The group's historical pattern of resuming activities after arrests suggests that any perception of the threat diminishing due to a quiet period is likely inaccurate, requiring continuous diligence across various sectors.\n\n**The big picture:**\nScattered Spider is an English-speaking cybercrime group, primarily based in the United States and the United Kingdom. It debuted in 2023 and experienced a significant resurgence earlier this year with a months-long hacking campaign. The group has historically targeted and ensnared companies in the insurance, retail, and airline industries. A broad coalition of information-sharing groups, representing diverse sectors from financial services to healthcare, issued a joint advisory about this widespread threat.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Scattered Spider debuted on the cybercrime scene in 2023.\n*   Four suspected members were arrested for allegedly hacking three major British retailers.\n*   The group launched a months-long hacking campaign earlier this year.\n*   It has ensnared companies including British department store Marks & Spencer, Whole Foods distributor United Natural Foods, and Australian airline Qantas.\n*   Information sharing groups represent 9 sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, information technology, and retail.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Scattered Spider:** A cybercrime gang innovating social-engineering attacks against various industries, now quiet.\n*   **ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers):** A coalition of groups urging members to mitigate cyberattacks and improve security measures.\n*   **FBI:** U.S. agency that, with CISA, warned about Scattered Spider's evolving social-engineering attack tactics.\n*   **CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):** U.S. agency that, with the FBI, warned about Scattered Spider's evolving attack tactics.\n*   **John Denning:** Chief Information Security Officer at FS-ISAC, who highlighted the widespread and shifting threat.\n*   **Google researchers:** Cautioned that Scattered Spider has previously resumed activities following high-profile arrests.\n*   **Marks & Spencer:** British department store ensnared by Scattered Spider's months-long hacking campaign.\n*   **United Natural Foods:** Whole Foods distributor ensnared by Scattered Spider's months-long hacking campaign.\n*   **Qantas:** Australian airline ensnared by Scattered Spider's months-long hacking campaign.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for Scattered Spider to potentially resume activities, as it has done after previous arrests.\n*   Expect the group to continue innovating and finding new ways to evade existing security measures.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPersistent cyber threat from Scattered Spider demands ongoing vigilance and innovative defenses.",

        "summary_text": "Scattered Spider, also known as Muddled Libra, Octo Tempest, Scatter Swine and UNC3944, is a group of cybercriminals who specialize in using social-engineering tactics to trick companies into handing over user credentials and bypassing multifactor authentication, opening the door for the group to establish persistence, steal company data and demand ransom payments.\n\nThe FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday warned that Scattered Spider is deploying new techniques to launch attacks against multiple industries.\n\nThe group historically has focused on the hospitality, telecommunications and retail sectors, targeting multiple organizations within each sector before moving on to the next one.\n\nScattered Spider \u201crepresents a serious and ongoing threat to U.S. organizations, using sophisticated social engineering and intrusion tactics to disrupt operations and extort victims,\u201d Chris Butera, acting executive assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA, said in a statement related to the advisory. \u201cTheir activities have impacted multiple sectors and underscore the continued risk ransomware poses to national security and economic stability.\u201d\n\nResearchers consider Scattered Spider unique within the cybercrime underground. The group consists largely of English-speaking young men, including many teenagers, from the U.S. and the U.K. Authorities estimate that it may have as many as 1,000 members.\n\nThe group is affiliated with an underground collective known as The Com, which experts have linked to a variety of crimes ranging from extortion and money laundering to predatory behavior involving minors, cryptocurrency theft and SIM swapping.\n\nScattered Spider does not operate as a consolidated, centralized unit, according to Palo Alto Networks, but rather in multiple subsets, each of which may have its own set of targets and collection of preferred techniques.\n\nThe hacker gang debuted on the scene in September 2023 with a headline-grabbing ransomware attack against hotel and casino giant MGM Resorts. The hackers disrupted operations at the property for several days, locking guests out of their rooms, shutting down elevators and disabling slot machines and ATMs. The attack cost the company more than $100 million.\n\nResearchers also linked Scattered Spider to the 2023 hack of household-products giant Clorox, which forced the company to shut down many of its systems and led to months of product shortages. In a $380 million lawsuit filed earlier this month, Clorox alleged that its IT vendor, Cognizant, failed to uphold its duties by handing over credentials to the hackers without authenticating them.\n\nAlways on the run\n\nIn November 2024, the the U.S. Department of Justice charged five people with stealing millions of dollars by harvesting employee credentials through phishing texts. Security researchers have described that activity, which involved hacks of 45 companies from September 2021 through April 2023, as Scattered Spider\u2019s initial crime spree.\n\nSpanish authorities arrested one of the defendants, a 23-year-old British man named Tyler Buchanan, and extradited him to the U.S. in April. The indictment and extradition led some security experts to believe the authorities had successfully neutralized Scattered Spider.\n\nBut in April, the group launched a series of social-engineering attacks against three major British retail companies: Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op. Two other major British companies may also have been hacked but have yet to admit it, Marks & Spencer\u2019s chairman told British lawmakers earlier this month.\n\nScattered Spider\u2019s latest attack spree, which began in April, cost an estimated 440 million British pounds, according to the U.K.-based Cyber Monitoring Centre.\n\nEarlier this month, British authorities arrested four people in connection with Scattered Spider\u2019s attacks. Police also seized a large trove of computer equipment and are analyzing it for evidence that could lead to additional arrests.\n\nMeanwhile, in May, Scattered Spider turned its attention to the U.S., launching a round of attacks against major retailers and their vendors, including Victoria\u2019s Secret, North Carolina-based Belk and Whole Foods distributor United Natural Foods.\n\nUNFI warned earlier this month that its breach could cost it up to $400 million in lost sales.\n\nSince June, Scattered Spider has shifted to new industries, targeting major insurance companies, airlines and other transportation companies. Recent victims have included Aflac, Allianz Life and Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance. Scattered Spider may also have been behind recent hacks of Hawaiian Airlines and Qantas.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s marquee program for collaborating with the private sector to thwart hackers has been seriously hobbled by the abrupt end of a major contract.\n\nThe Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) lost a large number of support personnel on Monday after CISA\u2019s contract with the technology firm ICF expired on July 25, according to three people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. \u201cJCDC went from 100-plus ICF contractors to 10\u201d after the Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contract in time, one of the people said.\n\nAnother person confirmed the unit lost more than 100 contractors.\n\nThe JCDC partners with companies, other agencies and foreign governments to plan for future threats, analyze ongoing attack campaigns and publish defensive guidance. Since its creation in 2021, it has coordinated the government\u2019s real-time responses to major incidents, held tabletop exercises with emerging industries, led detailed risk assessments for critical infrastructure sectors and spearheaded advisories on a wide range of topics.\n\nThe JCDC\u2019s loss of its contractors could significantly impede its collaborative work, including undermining its ability to marshal a unified private-sector response to a major cyberattack and reducing its capacity to collect and distribute threat information.\n\nDespite its ambitious remit, the JCDC has only a small federal staff and relies heavily on contractors for its day-to-day work, including unglamorous but vital activities like writing memos and arranging meetings. In particular, contractors \u201chelp to facilitate the relationship between CISA and other federal agencies,\u201d said one person familiar with the matter. There are more than 100 agencies, this person noted, and JCDC\u2019s partnerships team only has a few federal employees to manage all of those relationships.\n\nThe disruption to the JCDC\u2019s activities comes as CISA tries to stay ahead of increasingly aggressive Chinese state-backed attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure organizations. The JCDC has been serving as the tip of the spear for CISA\u2019s efforts to understand the extent of Beijing\u2019s campaigns.\n\nFor now, CISA can use emergency funding to retain the JCDC\u2019s remaining 10 ICF contractors for two weeks, and it can keep renewing that two-week arrangement until the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. But after that, the remaining ICF workers will need to leave.\n\nCISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said in a statement that the agency is \u201claser-focused\u201d on returning to its core authorities and \u201celiminating waste and saving taxpayer dollars.\u201d McCarthy said CISA is reviewing its contracts \u201cto ensure that all resources committed align with our core statutory mission and the priorities of the administration.\u201d She added that CISA is \u201ctaking steps to avoid any operational impact\u201d to its mission, but the agency declined to identify those steps.\n\nJCDC contractor ICF did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMore CISA cyber programs at risk\n\nThe ICF partnership is one of many CISA contracts that either recently expired or could soon expire because of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem\u2019s mandate that her office directly approve virtually all contracts for her $65 billion department. CISA\u2019s contract with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to analyze cyber-threat monitoring sensor data lapsed on July 20, and another contract with the lab expired in March.\n\nOther CISA contracts that could expire soon include Peraton\u2019s Cyber Threat Detection Analysis work, Nightwing\u2019s Engagement Support Services work and an arrangement with Sandia National Laboratories to produce defensive tools and risk assessment resources, according to a person familiar with the matter. CISA and the three organizations declined to discuss the contracts or even confirm their expiration dates. The person familiar with the matter said the Nightwing and Peraton contracts would expire at the end of August if not renewed.\n\nMore contract lapses could leave CISA in serious jeopardy, according to a second person familiar with the matter. \u201cEventually, [the agency] won\u2019t have the people to actually do work,\u201d this person said. \u201c[They\u2019re] losing people and not replacing them or their expertise.\u201d\n\nCISA is waiting for Noem\u2019s office to approve a one-year extension to the ICF contract, said a third person familiar with the matter, \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard that over a thousand similar memos are also waiting approval.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University over apparel trademark.\n\n**Key details:**\nColumbia Sportswear has filed a lawsuit against Columbia University, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract. Attorneys for Columbia Sportswear claim the university violated a 2023 written agreement by selling apparel with only the \"Columbia\" name. The university's webstore reportedly offered shirts, sweatshirts, and hats bearing only the word \"Columbia.\" Columbia Sportswear is seeking a jury trial, an injunction against the university's use of the name alone on apparel, a recall of products, and monetary damages.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis lawsuit challenges the clarity of brand distinction for Columbia Sportswear, as the university\u2019s use of the name allegedly creates customer confusion. The complaint asserts a false association between Columbia Sportswear and its competitors, such as Nike and Champion, could be formed. This perceived lack of clear market positioning or brand control could impact investor confidence in Columbia Sportswear's brand value and competitive landscape. The legal action highlights the ongoing battle over intellectual property rights and brand integrity in the apparel market.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe core of the dispute stems from a written agreement made in 2023 between Columbia Sportswear and Columbia University. This agreement stipulated that Columbia University could use the \"Columbia\" name, which Columbia Sportswear holds a trademark for, only if it was combined with a distinguishing mark. Such marks included the university\u2019s shield, crown, lion mascot logo, or words like \u201cuniversity,\u201d \u201cColumbia Law,\u201d or its founding year.

Maura Healey has announced plans to propose legislation that would devote $400 million to support research across the state amid federal funding uncertainty .\n\nThe money would be split evenly across two funds: a multiyear research funding pool to support projects at universities, hospitals and research institutions, and an additional funding reserve to support research and jobs at the state\u2019s public college s.\n\n\u201cIn the face of uncertainty from the federal government, this is about protecting one of the things that makes Massachusetts so special \u2014 our global leadership in health care and helping families across the world,\u201d Healey said in the Thursday announcement.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHealey\u2019s proposal comes as the Trump administration freezes and terminates research grants at universities in its crosshairs to pressure them into making policy changes, along with cutting funding more broadly across major scientific agencies.\n\nIn Massachusetts alone, the Trump administration has terminated research grants valued at nearly $583 million, according to a recent analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. When they were canceled, the grants had $252 million left to be paid out.\n\nOverall, the Trump administration has terminated research awards valued at roughly $6.9 billion across the U.S., the analysis found. Of that, $3.3 billion of the canceled funding hadn\u2019t yet been disbursed. The analysis did not account for frozen research grants, suggesting the level of hampered research funding across the nation may rise even higher.\n\nHealey\u2019s announcement pointed to the state\u2019s economic reliance on federal research funding. The state received nearly $8.6 billion in federal research funding in fiscal year 2024, which supported roughly 81,000 jobs and $7.8 billion in household income, recent findings from the University of Massachusetts Amherst found.\n\nMoreover, Massachusetts accounts for 1 in 10 research and development jobs in the U.S., according to the announcement.\n\nHalf of the $400 million would go toward a one-time funding pool to help pay for projects at universities, hospitals and research institutions. This pool would also support a one-year fellowship program for early-career researchers, the announcement said.\n\nThat pot of money would be housed at MassDevelopment, the state\u2019s development finance agency, and Massachusetts would use interest from its state stabilization fund to finance it.\n\nThe other half of the $400 million would be housed in a bridge funding reserve for the state\u2019s public colleges. That funding would support research costs, partnerships and jobs, including positions for graduate and postdoctorate students.\n\nThat fund would be paid for from revenue from Massachusetts\u2019 Fair Share, which adds a 4% tax on those with incomes above $1 million.\n\nSeveral university leaders in the state praised the proposal. They include the president of the University of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s public university system, as well as leaders of private institutions including Boston University, Northeastern University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cAdvances that spring from our universities, hospitals and laboratories benefit all Americans; if we see these institutions diminished or compromised, all Americans stand to lose,\u201d MIT President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth noted that \u201cno other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale.\u201d\n\nMIT has seen over $6 million worth of federal grants terminated, according to Center for American Progress data.\n\nMassachusetts is also home to Harvard University, which the Trump administration has cut off from all future federal research funding. Earlier this month, Harvard officials said the Trump administration\u2019s actions combined with recent congressional moves, such as raising the endowment tax wealthy institutions pay, could cost the university $1 billion a year.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Massachusetts boosts research funding amid federal grant cuts.\n\n**Key details:**\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey announced a plan to propose legislation to invest $400 million in state research funding. The money would be split evenly into two funds, supporting projects at universities, hospitals, and research institutions, and aiding public colleges. This initiative aims to protect the state\u2019s global leadership in healthcare against federal funding uncertainty. Half the funds would be housed at MassDevelopment, financed by state stabilization fund interest, while the other half would come from Massachusetts\u2019 Fair Share tax. The proposal also includes support for early-career researchers and positions for graduate and postdoctorate students.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis state-level investment directly counters the Trump administration's actions of freezing and terminating significant federal research grants. While a university leader noted no other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale, the proposal challenges the view that federal funding is the only viable support for research given state efforts to step in. The state's economic reliance on research, supporting 81,000 jobs and billions in household income, underscores the proposal's importance for maintaining economic stability. If successful, this could set a precedent for states to safeguard critical sectors when federal support becomes unreliable.\n\n**The big picture:**\nGov. Healey's proposal directly responds to the Trump administration's policy of freezing and terminating research grants at universities. This federal strategy has also involved broader funding cuts across major scientific agencies nationwide. Massachusetts has a substantial economic dependence on federal research funding, having received nearly $8.6 billion in fiscal year 2024. Furthermore, the state accounts for a notable 1 in 10 research and development jobs across the U.S. Several university leaders within the state have expressed praise for this state-led funding initiative.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$400 million:** Amount Massachusetts plans to devote to state research funding.\n*   **$583 million:** Value of Trump administration research grants terminated in Massachusetts, according to one analysis.\n*   **$6.9 billion:** Total value of Trump administration research awards terminated across the U.S.\n*   **$8.6 billion:** Federal research funding Massachusetts received in fiscal year 2024.\n*   **1 in 10:** Proportion of U.S. research and development jobs located in Massachusetts.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Maura Healey:** Massachusetts Governor who announced plans to propose $400 million in state research funding.\n*   **Trump administration:** Federal government entity responsible for freezing and terminating research grants.\n*   **Center for American Progress:** A liberal think tank that conducted an analysis of terminated federal research grants.\n*   **University of Massachusetts Amherst:** Institution whose findings demonstrated Massachusetts' reliance on federal research funding.\n*   **MassDevelopment:** The state\u2019s development finance agency, which would house part of the proposed research funding.\n*   **University of Massachusetts:** President of the state's public university system who praised the funding proposal.\n*   **Boston University:** A private institution whose leaders praised the state's research funding proposal.\n*   **Northeastern University:** A private institution whose leaders praised the state's research funding proposal.\n*   **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):** University that has experienced over $6 million in terminated federal grants.\n*   **Sally Kornbluth:** MIT President who stated that no other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale.\n*   **Harvard University:** University cut off from all future federal research funding by the Trump administration.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMassachusetts seeks to stabilize its research economy amid federal funding uncertainty.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nInternational enrollment at U.S. colleges could drop by as much as 150,000 students this fall unless the federal government ramps up its issuing of visas this summer, according to recent projections from NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n\nThe financial consequences could be severe. A 30% to 40% decline in new foreign students would lead to a 15% overall drop in international enrollment and, with it, a potential loss of $7 billion in revenue for colleges and 60,000 higher education jobs, NAFSA estimated.\n\nThe organization attributed the projected decline to various Trump administration actions, including travel bans and an earlier suspension of visa interviews. NAFSA called on Congress to direct the State Department to expedite processing for student visas.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPreliminary data from early this year suggested \u201cflat to modest growth\u201d in international student enrollment, but NASFA pointed to policy changes that could alter the landscape ahead.\n\nSince President Donald Trump retook office this year, many in the higher education world have worried international enrollment would decline in response to his policies and the perceptions abroad about America and how welcoming it will be to foreign students.\n\nHis administration has indeed taken an aggressive stance on admitting students from outside the U.S. In June, Trump signed an executive order banning travel from 12 countries and imposing restrictions on seven others. And the president has recently considered bans on 36 more countries.\n\nAlso in June, the State Department announced expanded screening that included surveillance of social media posts for applicants of F, M and J nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThat followed an announcement in May from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the U.S. would move to \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas for Chinese students. Trump later appeared to walk back that stance on social media, adding more confusion as to the administration\u2019s actual policy.\n\nNAFSA pointed to reports of limited to no visa review appointments for prospective international students in India, China, Nigeria and Japan. The organization noted that India and China send the most international students to the U.S., while Nigeria and Japan are the seventh and 13th leading home countries, respectively.\n\nOn top of those moves, the administration has demonstrated interest in using international student enrollment as leverage against institutions and activists in Trump\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThrough various directives, for example,Trump and his government have tried to bar Harvard from enrolling international students in the administration\u2019s ongoing feud with the university. Each of those efforts have been temporarily blocked in court. Had they not been, the consequences for Harvard would likely be dire. In the 2024-25 academic year, the Ivy League university\u2019s roughly 6,800 foreign students made up 27.2% of its student body.\n\nEarlier this year, the administration also moved to deny visas for pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nA July report from analysts with Moody\u2019s ratings services pointed to the potential financial fallout for colleges from declines in international enrollment. They noted that foreign students tend to pay full tuition and fees, heightening the potential revenue impact.\n\nA stress test by the analysts found that for 130 colleges they rate, a 20% drop in international enrollment would translate into a 0.5 percentage-point hit to their earnings margin before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization. For 18 colleges, EBITDA margin loss would be 2 to 8 points. Those with already low margins could face \u201csignificant financial stress,\u201d the analysts said.",

A 30% to 40% decline in new foreign students could lead to a 15% overall drop in international enrollment. This decline is estimated to result in a $7 billion revenue loss for colleges and 60,000 lost higher education jobs. NAFSA attributes this to Trump administration policies, including travel bans and suspended visa interviews.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis matters because the projected decline could mean a potential loss of $7 billion in revenue for colleges and 60,000 higher education jobs. Foreign students typically pay full tuition and fees, heightening the financial impact.

        "summary_text": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Liz Clark would have lost a bet on the massive Republican tax and spending bill passed and signed into law earlier this month.\n\nClark, the vice president for policy and research at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said she didn\u2019t expect the bill to be finalized until early fall. While only off by a few months, Clark\u2019s missed guess illustrates just one of many unexpected developments for higher education \u2014 and the world \u2014 since President Donald Trump retook office in January.\n\nSpeaking at NACUBO\u2019s annual conference near Washington, D.C., on Sunday, Clark pointed to more than a decade of divided governments, intraparty policy squabbles and political gridlock as Democrats and Republicans have traded thin majorities in Congress.\n\nBased on that history, it might have seemed improbable that Republicans could swiftly move a massive policy package through two houses of Congress where they held razor-thin leads. But Republicans did, and Congress got a bill to Trump\u2019s desk by the date he demanded.\n\n\u201cThis is a quintessential moment in seeing that past performance is no indication of future results,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThe bill has plenty of implications for college finance departments, not to mention students and all other stakeholders in higher education. And it\u2019s just one of many policy sea changes the sector has seen since Trump and a Republican-led Congress came to office six short months ago.\n\nFrom new taxes to new legal liabilities, below is a look at how politics and policy are impacting college finance offices.\n\nA blitz of executive orders\n\nSo far in his roughly six months in office, Trump has already issued more executive orders than Joe Biden did during his entire four-year term. According to data from the American Presidency Project, Trump is on pace to issue more orders per year than any other president in history, except potentially Franklin Roosevelt in his first term at the height of the Great Depression.\n\nAnd several of those orders have cut to the heart of higher ed in the U.S., including orders targeting college diversity initiatives and seeking to revamp accreditation.\n\n\u201cEvery president has tested the limits of executive power. This is not new,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhat is new, at least for us, especially when it comes to issues impacting higher education, is the scope, the number of executive orders, the number of changes in law that are impacting your campuses.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have, this year, been dealing with everything, everywhere, all at once.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order on diversity, equity and inclusion programs has drawn rebukes, including through litigation, for being vague and potentially stifling to free speech and intellectual activity.\n\n\"DEI is not illegal,\" Clark said, pointing specifically to the administration's executive order on the topic.\n\nCollege researchers, meanwhile, are being asked to certify their compliance with executive orders, including those related to DEI, when applying for grants. That can present a dicey situation when directives are vaguely worded.\n\nIn some cases, federal agencies have even asked researchers to certify compliance with all future executive orders that may be issued someday, noted Jen Gartner, deputy general counsel for University of Maryland, College Park, at a NACUBO conference panel Monday.\n\n\u201cObviously, we don't know what we would be certifying compliance with,\u201d Gartner said.\n\nCertification requirements for grants can vary by agency, but Gartner noted the one commonality is that they \u201cnow all mention that our certification is material for the False Claims Act.\u201d\n\nThe False Claims Act bars fraud in government contracting. Trump\u2019s Department of Justice in May launched an initiative that threatens universities with investigations under the law over their DEI programs and policies for transgender students and athletes.\n\nSpeaking from firsthand experience, Gartner said such investigations can take years to settle and cost colleges time, money and reputational damage \u2014 all of which adds financial and legal stakes to what might seem like bureaucratic formalities in certifications.\n\nBig changes to higher ed under the big bill\n\nThe spending law enacted in July contains several policies set to shake up higher ed both directly and indirectly. \u201cI would go so far as to say that the issues we saw in this bill were akin to a Higher Education Act reauthorization,\u201d Clark said, referring to the primary federal law governing higher education and student aid \u2014 which was last reauthorized in 2008.\n\nNew policies include higher taxes on the wealthiest college endowments, with the top rate jumping to 8%, up from 1.4% currently.\n\nIt also opens up Pell Grants to short-term workforce-focused programs at accredited institutions that last eight to 15 weeks, while adding borrowing limits, and making other changes to student aid.\n\nBryan Dickson, NACUBO\u2019s director of student financial services and educational programs, described the short-term Pell Grants as a \u201cgreat win\u201d for community colleges at this week\u2019s conference. He added, however, that there are still questions about how the program will work, including about conflicting statute language on whether students already holding bachelor\u2019s degrees will be eligible for the short-term grants.\n\nThe bill additionally creates a new accountability system for college programs that's meant to ensure most students get an earnings boost from their credentials.\n\nCollege programs that fail the earnings test in two out of three consecutive years can lose their eligibility for the federal student loan program. Dickson emphasized that the policy applies only to direct loans, not other Title IV programs such as Pell Grants.\n\nAside from the specific higher ed policies, colleges could see indirect effects from the law.\n\nOne of the largest could be the massive cuts Republicans made to Medicaid and food stamp programs. Those cuts could put pressure on states to fill in the gaps to reduce the harms to their lower-income residents \u2014 which in turn could mean less money available for public institutions in state budgets.\n\n\u201cIf you thought your current battles with your state legislature were bad, just wait for what's to come in 2026,\u201d Clark said.\n\nDeep cuts to the Education Department\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has made deep staff cuts to the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 in line with a Trump executive order calling for the department\u2019s dismantling to the \u201cmaximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\u201d A full elimination of the department would require congressional approval.\n\nNow with a staff roughly half its former size, the Education Department still has plenty to do, including writing regulations for the new short-term Pell Grants and accountability programs created by the spending bill, among other administration priorities and statutory requirements.\n\nSome effects from the cuts are already evident. Dickson pointed to a National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators survey showing that 47% of institutions confirmed their region\u2019s federal Financial Student Aid office had closed.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump Policies Rapidly Reshape Higher Ed Finance, Compliance Landscape\n\n**Key details:** A Republican tax and spending bill passed earlier than anticipated, introducing new taxes on the wealthiest college endowments, raising the top rate to 8% from 1.4%. The bill also expanded Pell Grants to short-term workforce programs and established a new accountability system for college programs based on student earnings. President Trump has issued a high volume of executive orders, some targeting college diversity initiatives and accreditation, leading to new legal liabilities and compliance complexities for institutions. The U.S. Department of Education has seen its staff reduced to roughly half its former size, impacting federal loan servicing and Financial Student Aid office operations.\n\n**Why it matters:** The swift passage of the \"massive policy package\" and the \"blitz of executive orders\" challenge the previously expected political gridlock, illustrating that \"past performance is no indication of future results\" for policy changes. These \"policy sea changes\" introduce significant financial consequences for colleges through increased taxes and potential state budget cuts. New compliance requirements, particularly vague certifications, expose universities to legal risks under the False Claims Act, potentially causing financial, time, and reputational damage. Deep cuts to the Education Department are already resulting in federal loan servicing issues for students, indicating broader operational challenges for institutions.\n\n**The big picture:** In just six months, the Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress have initiated numerous \"policy sea changes\" in higher education, a pace unexpected given more than a decade of divided governments and political gridlock. The recent spending law's changes are akin to a \"Higher Education Act reauthorization,\" a significant federal law last updated in 2008. President Trump's executive orders have tested the limits of executive power, with an unprecedented scope and number impacting higher education issues specifically. Colleges now face a new environment of rapid and broad policy shifts that contrast with prior expectations of slower legislative action.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **8%**: New top tax rate on the wealthiest college endowments, up from 1.4%.\n*   **8 to 15 weeks**: Length of short-term workforce-focused programs now eligible for Pell Grants.\n*   **Roughly half**: Current size of the U.S. Department of Education staff compared to its former size.\n*   **47%**: Percentage of institutions reporting their region\u2019s federal Financial Student Aid office had closed.\n*   **42%**: Percentage of institutions reporting students experiencing federal loan servicing issues.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Liz Clark**: NACUBO Vice President for Policy and Research, she discussed unexpected, swift policy changes impacting higher education.\n*   **National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO)**: Hosted the conference where impacts of new policies on higher education finance were discussed.\n*   **President Donald Trump**: Signed a massive Republican tax and spending bill and issued numerous executive orders affecting higher education.\n*   **Jen Gartner**: Deputy General Counsel for University of Maryland, College Park, she highlighted compliance challenges with vague executive order certifications.\n*   **Bryan Dickson**: NACUBO's Director of Student Financial Services and Educational Programs, he commented on new Pell Grant provisions and accountability systems.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Colleges will face a \"major stress test\" on reduced Education Department staffing levels as the fall semester and \"fall drawdowns\" approach.\n*   The Education Department still needs to write regulations for the new short-term Pell Grants and accountability programs created by the spending bill.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Swift policy changes impose significant financial burdens and legal risks on colleges.",

They also noted that schools and units were given discretion in making cuts and asked to \u201cthink strategically\u201d to minimize the impact to units, workers, students and the university.\n\nNorthwestern is among the prominent universities targeted by the Trump administration through probes into their responses to antisemitism on campus by the U.S. departments of Education and Health and Human Services.\n\nThe university, however, has reported an 88% year-over-year decline in complaints of antisemitic discrimination or harassment as of November 2024.\n\nNonetheless, the Trump administration in April reportedly froze $790 million funds to Northwestern. Although the university at the time hadn\u2019t received official notification of a targeted freeze from the government, it saw around 150 stop-work orders and grant terminations from federal agencies by May 1.\n\nLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported via an anonymous source that the Trump administration was in talks with Northwestern and other universities about possible deals that would involve a hefty fine to resolve the investigations. The news followed Columbia University's controversial settlement with the government requiring a $221 million payment in return for the government restoring most of its research funding.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Daily Northwestern on Tuesday, a group of Northwestern faculty described such fines as a \u201cransom\u201d and called on university leadership to \u201cresist the administration\u2019s attack on fundamental democratic principles by refusing to 'make a deal' with the administration.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Northwestern cuts 425 staff jobs amid severe financial strain.\n\n**Key details:** Northwestern University plans to cut approximately 425 staff jobs, representing about 5% of its staffing budget. Nearly half of these positions are currently vacant, with the remainder being layoffs that administrators aim to complete within 48 hours. These personnel cuts are a \"drastic step\" necessitated by a \"budgetary gap\" that could not be bridged by other austerity measures. The university noted that employee costs constitute 56% of its total annual spending.\n\n**Why it matters:** This development highlights significant financial challenges for a prominent university, which officials described as \"among the most difficult\" in its 174-year history. It challenges the common perception of large university financial stability, showing vulnerability to federal policy changes and funding issues. The cuts underscore how federal research funding reductions and potential endowment taxes, as well as reported fund freezes, can directly impact a university's operational capacity and force drastic measures.\n\n**The big picture:** Northwestern has been facing \"an increasing strain\" on its finances due to looming federal policy changes and rising expenses. Prior austerity measures included a pause on raises, a hiring freeze, health insurance changes, reduced capital spending, and lowered budgets for academic and administrative units.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice released guidance Wednesday that threatens to strip grant funding from colleges and other federally funded institutions over what the agency deems unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nThe agency\u2019s memo targets a sweeping set of practices, including offering race-based scholarship programs, allowing transgender women to access bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity and having identity-based lounges or study spaces on campus \u2014 even if they are open to all.\n\nBut the nine-page memo goes a step further, saying even neutral criteria \u2014 such as recruitment strategies targeting certain regions \u2014 could be deemed unlawful if the Justice Department determines they are chosen because of their demographic composition.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s memo comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked similar guidance from the U.S. Department of Education that broadly targeted diversity, equity and inclusion programs at federally funded colleges and K-12 schools. The order came in response to a lawsuit that alleged the guidance \u201cradically upends\u201d federal antidiscrimination laws.\n\nThe guidance from the Justice Department illustrates the major shift in how the agency under President Donald Trump approaches enforcement of civil rights laws, with officials now targeting programs that were often actually launched to fight systemic discrimination.\n\nEarlier this month, the National Urban League declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for antidiscrimination policies, calling the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement priorities \u201can existential threat\u201d to civil rights laws, according to The Associated Press.\n\nLike the Education Department\u2019s blocked guidance, the Justice Department\u2019s new memo warns that government officials could pull federal funding from institutions that don\u2019t comply. That threat comes at the same time the agency has ramped up investigations into colleges over their diversity initiatives and their responses to antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe DOJ memo contains examples of practices it lists as \u201cunlawful\u201d and says could lead to federal funding being revoked, as well as a list of recommendations, which it says are not mandatory, to avoid \"legal pitfalls.\"\n\n\u201cThis Department of Justice will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in illegal discrimination,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cThis guidance will ensure we are serving the American people and not ideological agendas.\u201d\n\nAs examples of unlawful practices, the agency highlighted race-based scholarships or programs, including mentorship programs or leadership initiatives reserved for members of certain racial groups.\n\nThe memo could upend admissions. It recommends colleges end programs \"designed to achieve discriminatory outcomes\" even if they have \u201cfacially neutral\u201d criteria, such as targeting scholarships to certain regions to increase enrollment or participation among certain racial groups.\n\n\u201cInstead, use universally applicable criteria, such as academic merit or financial hardship, applied without regard to protected characteristics or demographic goals,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo also takes aim at what it describes as \u201cunlawful proxies\u201d for race and sex. As an example, the memo calls out universities that ask job applicants \u201cto demonstrate \u2018cultural competence,\u2019 \u2018lived experience,\u2019 or \u2018cross-cultural skills\u2019 in ways that effectively evaluate candidates\u2019 racial or ethnic backgrounds rather than objective qualifications.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department also flagged diversity statements \u2014 which typically ask job or graduate student candidates to explain their experience and commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives \u2014 as potentially unlawful if they advantage \u201cthose who discuss experiences intrinsically tied to protected characteristics.\u201d The memo said the same of asking for statements from applicants about \u201cobstacles they have overcome,\u201d a common essay prompt for college applications.\n\nState lawmakers have likewise targeted diversity statements, with many outlawing public colleges from requiring them in job or admission applications.\n\nThe memo also said failing to \u201cmaintain sex-separated athletic competitions and intimate spaces\u201d could violate federal law. The Justice Department\u2019s examples of those violations include allowing transgender women to use bathrooms, showers, locker rooms and dormitories designated for women, as well as allowing them to compete in women\u2019s athletic events.\n\nAnd it mentions college lounges or other spaces designated for specific groups, such as a \u201cBIPOC-only study lounge.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment,\u201d the memo stated. \u201cThis extends to any resource allocation \u2014 such as study spaces, computer labs, or event venues \u2014 that segregates access based on protected characteristics, even if intended to create \u2018safe spaces.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt also takes aim at diversity training, giving the example of requiring teachers at K-12 schools to complete a DEI training that includes statements such as \u201call white people are inherently privileged\" or touching on \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d\n\nThe memo says such trainings could violate civil rights laws \u201cif they create a hostile environment or impose penalties for dissent in ways that result in discriminatory treatment.\u201d",

UCLA officials declined to disband the encampment for nearly a week, citing the need to balance free speech protections with student and employee safety.\n\nIn a letter to Michael Drake, president of the University of California system, Justice Department officials said they would seek to enter a voluntary resolution with UCLA to \u201censure that the hostile environment is eliminated.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Justice Department is also investigating the entire University of California system over similar allegations.

They threatened the university with a lawsuit by Sept. 2 if they don\u2019t believe they can strike an agreement with the institution.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation focused on the pro-Palestinian encampment erected on UCLA\u2019s campus on April 25, 2024. Encampment demonstrators demanded that the university divest from companies with ties to Israel\u2019s military.\n\nOn the same day it was erected, a university spokesperson told the campus community that officials were monitoring the situation to balance the \u201cright to free expression while minimizing disruption\u201d to the institution\u2019s teaching and learning mission.\n\nHowever, several days into the protest, some demonstrators formed human blockades to prevent some people on campus from moving freely throughout Royce Quad, including students wearing a Star of David or those who refused to denounce Zionism, according to an internal report from a university task force released last October.\n\nThe task force also found the encampment violated university rules and that the blockades disparately impacted Jewish people.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s letter to UCLA heavily cited the university\u2019s own task force report, as well as 11 complaints the university received alleging that encampment protesters discriminated against them based on their race, religion or national origin.\n\n\u201cUCLA\u2019s documentation established that it did not outright ignore these complaints; however, the University took no meaningful action to eliminate the hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students caused by the encampment until it was disbanded,\u201d the letter states.\n\nViolence broke out at the site on the night of April 30, 2024, when counterprotesters attempted to dismantle the encampment\u2019s barricade, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe counterprotesters attacked those within the encampment, including by launching fireworks into the encampment and hitting the pro-Palestinian protesters with sticks, according to the publication. Some of the pro-Palestinian protesters also fought back.\n\nPolice arrived hours later, though they did not immediately break up the violence. The next day, UCLA officials made the call to have police break up the encampment, resulting in over 200 arrests.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the encampment on Royce Quad was both unlawful and a breach of policy,\u201d then-UC Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement. \u201cIt led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission.

UCLA officials delayed disbanding the encampment for nearly a week. The Justice Department, also investigating the entire University of California system, found \"concerning evidence of systemic anti-Semitism at UCLA.\" Separately, UCLA settled a lawsuit with Jewish students and a professor for approximately $6 million over allegations of blocked campus access during protests.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe Justice Department's direct allegations and threat of a lawsuit indicate significant legal and financial risk for UCLA, challenging its initial approach to the protests. The DOJ stated it would \"force UCLA to pay a heavy price,\" highlighting the potential for substantial penalties beyond the $6 million settlement already agreed upon. This scrutiny, including evidence of \"systemic anti-Semitism,\" suggests the university's handling of the situation is viewed as a systemic failure, not just a free speech issue, contradicting any perception of appropriate management.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe DOJ investigation focused on a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on UCLA\u2019s campus on April 25, 2024, where demonstrators sought divestment from companies tied to Israel\u2019s military. An internal university task force report from last October found the encampment violated rules and its blockades disparately impacted Jewish people.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn early June, the governing board of Florida\u2019s university system surprised the higher education sector when it rejected Santa Ono as the sole finalist for the presidency of the University of Florida. Ono had faced backlash \u2014 led by conservative activist Christopher Rufo \u2014 over his past embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while head of the University of Michigan.\n\nLater that month, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan abruptly stepped down after the U.S. Department of Justice pressured him to resign over the institution\u2019s diversity efforts. Ryan said he wouldn't fight to keep his job when staying would have cost the institution research funding and student aid and hurt international students.\n\nThe duties of the modern college president extend far beyond keeping their institutions viable. For decades, how the head of a college is selected and who fills the position has been steadily shifting. Now, whoever assumes the role will likely take vitriol from both the public and policymakers.\n\nJames Finkelstein, professor emeritus at George Mason University's public policy school, researches leadership in higher education. We spoke with him about the changing role of the college president, the increased influence a presidency faces from both the political and private sectors and what that means for higher ed in the long run.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHIGHER ED DIVE: How does one become a college president? And has that changed in recent decades?\n\nJames Finkelstein, professor emeritus at George Mason University Permission granted by Judith Wilde\n\nJAMES FINKELSTEIN: The traditional route would start with becoming an assistant professor. You get tenure next, and then you may start to move up the administrative ranks. The most common path was to go from provost to president. For now, that's still the most common path, but it's on the decline.\n\nThe problem is, provosts don't fundraise. Deans do. And the No. 1 qualification that a board now looks for in a university president is their ability to raise money.\n\nGiven that shift in priorities, how do college boards pick their institution's next presidents?\n\nMy colleague, Judith Wilde, and I have studied this process extensively, and boards are increasingly relying on executive search firms.\n\nWe found that only 2% or 3% of presidential classified ads mentioned a search firm in 1975. Today, it's almost 100%. And based on the data, that change has also correlated with the beginning of the decline in the length of university presidents' tenure.\n\nSearch firms do the initial screening and determine for the board which candidates are really viable. But very few of the search firm senior executives have any real experience in higher education and their No. 1 responsibility as fiduciaries is to return profit to investors.\n\nFrom there, the board picks from the candidates highlighted by the search firm? What do they look for?\n\nYes. People tend to look for candidates who look like them. And boards are not primarily made up of academics \u2014 the only thing most board members know about a university is that they got a degree from one. You're seeing a lot more political types on the boards, as is the case in Virginia, or corporate types.\n\nIt's interesting, corporations don't turn to universities for their leadership. They don't select a college president to run them. The former president of TIAA [Clifton Wharton Jr.] was the only university president to become a CEO of a Fortune 500 company \u2014 and he led a company designed to serve universities.\n\nBut many universities, at least 10% or so, will select a corporate executive to lead them.\n\nIf boards expect university presidents to behave more like corporate executives than leaders of an educational, social and cultural institution \u2014 someone who serves the public \u2014 then the next generation of university leadership is going to look very different. You're going to see a different kind of person be not only sought after but interested in these jobs because they think they can take their private sector skill set directly into higher ed.\n\nIn recent years, the presidential compensation packages at some colleges have mirrored those of Fortune 500 CEOs. In 2022, Ben Sasse received a notably lucrative package when he was hired to lead the University of Florida, as you and Judith have discussed . What effect does that shift have on colleges?\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate, the university president probably wore a tweed sport coat with leather patches on the elbows. And the patches weren't there to make a style statement; it's because the elbows were worn out. If he had a car \u2014 and it was far and away \"he\" when I was in school \u2014 it was a car from the university's car pool that was several years old.\n\nAnd in the past, presidents maintained some academic interests. They taught. They were visible on campus.\n\nNow, university presidents drive expensive cars and are more likely to associate with people outside the university than faculty inside the university.\n\nOur sector does not enjoy the reputation with the public that it used to. There are all sorts of questions now about the value of a college degree. People generally think faculty get paid a lot of money and don't do very much.\n\nMore than anything, presidents today are facing the question of if there is a way to win back that trust.\n\nWhile college presidents are grappling with that question, though, they are also watching their positions become increasingly precarious. One recent example is Santa Ono, who had been set up as Sasse's replacement. Traditionally, the vote from the Florida universities' governing board would have been pro forma. What shifted the tides and left Ono out of a job?\n\nOno was targeted by the Chris Rufo machine. You can go back and read Rufo's interview with Politico and listen to his interview with The New York Times \u2014 he's very public about his strategy to delegitimize leaders in higher ed. His team made a decision early on that they wanted one of their own in Florida. And Ono wasn't it.\n\nHaving watched the entire governing board meeting in Florida, my professional assessment is that I've never seen a president or someone of Ono's stature so ill-prepared and give so poor a performance on every level.\n\nWhoever prepared him, didn't. And if they did, they weren't preparing him for the right thing. It was much like what happened to the college presidents who testified at congressional committee hearings. Ono wasn't completely prepared that he was going to be essentially cross-examined by a former state legislator.\n\nBy that point, Ono had already announced his departure from the University of Michigan, leaving a highly debated track record on diversity efforts and the handling of student protests in his wake. Does he stand a chance of getting another job heading a university?\n\nAbout 75% of presidents are what we call one-and-done \u2014 they report they'll hold one presidency, and that's more than enough. The Gordon Gees of the world are the exception, not the rule.\n\nOno was, in my view, the modern-day equivalent of [former West Virginia University President] Gordon Gee. He's the professional president who developed a public persona. He developed it at the University of Cincinnati, refined it at the University of British Columbia, and then brought it to Michigan.\n\nBut I've talked to people at Cincinnati and Michigan. The truth of the matter is, he wasn't well-thought of by the faculty. And he burned out very quickly in Michigan.\n\nOno shouldn't be the model for the modern university president. Personally, I don't think that he's going to get another presidency after the Florida situation, at least not for a while.\n\nIs the role of president still a consequential one? Do the heads of colleges wield influence in the same way they have in the past?\n\nWho the president is makes a difference. They set the tone of the institution in many ways. But presidents today can exercise less independent leadership than they did in the past \u2014 they're being put on a shorter and shorter leash.\n\nThere are so many different constituencies that they're having to serve, and a lot of those constituencies are in conflict with each other.\n\nSome presidents are engaging in what people call anticipatory compliance.\n\n\"In order to avoid these conflicts,\" the thinking goes, \"I'm going to get one step ahead.\" Sadly, what that means is that when the board intervenes, they want even more.\n\nIs there a world where that kind of interference becomes so unpleasant that it renders the job unpalatable?\n\nI think for many serious potential candidates, the answer is yes. It doesn't matter whether you're being paid $1 million. Or if you have two country club memberships, a big car, a big house and staff, and all of that. These jobs have always been 24/7, 365. And the scrutiny is exponentially worse now.\n\nThe real question is: Who's going to want these jobs? That's part of the plan of critics of higher education. They want to drive people out so they can replicate what they're doing in Florida and appoint political loyalists who have no experience in higher education.\n\nEven though conservatives are critical of what they see as judicial activism, they have been extraordinarily active on college boards, working to influence curriculum and promotions and tenure.\n\nThe current climate changes things for all trustees, even those who don't align with this thinking. Regardless of their backgrounds, no board will want to appoint a president who is going to put at risk all of their research funding. And the Trump administration has shown that it is willing to use any lever it has to bring these institutions under its thumb. Look how quickly Jim Ryan was gone from UVA.\n\nAs you mentioned, presidents are serving increasingly shorter tenures, instead of holding the position for life, or at least until retirement. Beyond a loss of leadership consistency, does this turnover hurt colleges?\n\nTake Jim Ryan as an example. He's 58 years old.\n\nI assume the terms of his contract were renegotiated when he left, but based on my analysis of his 2022 contract, the university has a future liability of almost $17 million to him. He would actuarially retire from teaching in 15 years, and in 2038, his base salary would be over $1 million a year for teaching at most two courses a semester.\n\nThe people who are actually doing most of the teaching at UVA in 2038 won\u2019t be tenured or tenure track. They will be contingent faculty who are barely able to scrape together a living.\n\nIf you put $10 million in a scholarship fund at UVA, would that be a better investment than keeping Ryan on the faculty? The answer is a no-brainer.",

        "summary": "**College President Role Shifts Amid Political Pressure, Shortened Tenures**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe leadership role of college presidents is undergoing a significant transformation, with fundraising ability now the top qualification sought by boards. This shift leads to increased reliance on executive search firms and a preference for corporate or political candidates over traditional academics. Presidents now face severe public and policymaker scrutiny, which has resulted in shorter tenures and less independent leadership. Notable examples include Santa Ono's rejection for the University of Florida presidency and Jim Ryan's resignation from the University of Virginia due to political pressure over diversity efforts.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis transformation challenges the traditional view of universities as primarily academic institutions led by scholars, favoring a corporate-style management approach. The increased political influence on college boards, as seen in Virginia, could lead to appointments of political loyalists lacking higher education experience. This climate risks institutions' research funding and student aid, as demonstrated by Jim Ryan's departure to protect UVA\u2019s finances. Consequently, the next generation of university leadership will look fundamentally different, impacting the long-term values and direction of higher education.\n\n**The big picture:**\nFor decades, the selection process and profiles of college presidents have been steadily shifting away from the traditional academic path. The role now demands navigating intense public and policymaker scrutiny, leading to a \"shorter leash\" for leaders. This occurs amidst a decline in public trust in higher education and increasing questions about the value of a college degree. Critics of higher education are actively influencing college boards to drive out experienced leaders and appoint politically aligned individuals.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Executive search firms were mentioned in 2-3% of presidential classified ads in 1975, now almost 100%.\n*   At least 10% of universities select a corporate executive to lead them.\n*   Approximately 75% of university presidents are \"one-and-done,\" holding only a single presidency.\n*   Former UVA President Jim Ryan's future liability to the university is almost $17 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Santa Ono:** Rejected as University of Florida president due to backlash over diversity efforts.\n*   **Christopher Rufo:** Conservative activist who led the backlash campaign against Santa Ono.\n*   **Jim Ryan:** University of Virginia president who resigned under U.S. Department of Justice pressure.\n*   **U.S. Department of Justice:** Pressured University of Virginia President Jim Ryan over diversity efforts.\n*   **James Finkelstein:** Higher education leadership researcher, provided insights on changing presidential roles.\n*   **Ben Sasse:** Hired to lead the University of Florida with a notably lucrative compensation package.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPolitical and corporate pressures reshape university leadership, impacting stability and institutional values.",

It comes one month after The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, alleged that Duke Law Journal potentially gave students applying to be editors an edge if they held leadership positions in affinity groups or if they explained how their \u201cmembership in an underrepresented group\u201d would help them promote diverse voices.\n\nDuke Law Journal shared this information only with the law school\u2019s affinity groups, according to the Beacon.\n\nThe letter from HHS and the Education Department doesn\u2019t provide the source of the allegations of racial discrimination against Duke\u2019s medical school and Duke Health. However, it says Duke Health would be \u201cunfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government\u201d if the federal government determines they are true.\n\nIn their letter, officials suggested they want to cut a deal with the university.\n\n\u201cOur Departments have historically recognized Duke\u2019s commitment to medical excellence and would prefer to partner with Duke to uncover and repair these problems, rather than terminate this relationship,\u201d McMahon and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote.\n\nThe two Cabinet secretaries demanded that the university review and reform policies at Duke Health to ensure they don\u2019t include illegal racial preferences, including by making \u201cnecessary organizational, leadership, and personnel changes.\u201d\n\nThey also asked Duke to establish a Merit and Civil Rights Committee, which would be delegated authority from the university\u2019s board, to conduct the review.\n\n\u201cThe Committee must be made up of those members of Duke\u2019s leadership and medical faculty most distinguished in and devoted to genuine excellence in the field of medicine, and the members chosen must satisfy the federal government as to their competence and good faith,\u201d McMahon and Kennedy said in their letter.\n\nMcMahon and Kennedy threatened Duke with enforcement actions if the federal government and the Merit and Civil Rights Committee reach an impasse \u2014 or if they don\u2019t change the \u201calleged offending policies\u201d within six months.\n\nFollowing Columbia\u2019s controversial agreement with the federal government \u2014 which also included vast policy changes \u2014 law and free speech scholars warned that the Trump administration may attempt to increase their pressure campaigns against other universities to cut deals.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has made clear that while Columbia is first in line, it intends to reach comparable agreements with other schools \u2014 to scale the Columbia shakedown into a broader model of managing universities deemed too woke,\u201d David Pozen, a Columbia law professor, wrote in a blog post. \u201cAs has already occurred with law firms, tariffs, and trade policy, regulation by deal is coming to higher education.",

Separately, the Education Department and HHS are reviewing allegations of racial discrimination in hiring, admissions, financial aid, and recruitment at Duke\u2019s medical school and Duke Health. These probes stem from recent reporting, including one by The Washington Free Beacon, regarding the law journal\u2019s practices. The government warned Duke Health could become \"unfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government\" if allegations are proven true.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis matters because Duke University, a federally funded institution, faces potential severe financial penalties, including losing federal funding for Duke Health. Federal officials explicitly demanded Duke review and reform policies, including \"necessary organizational, leadership, and personnel changes,\" within six months. This suggests a more forceful regulatory stance by the government, challenging any consensus that such institutions are immune to direct federal intervention over alleged discrimination. The Trump administration is reportedly attempting to increase \"pressure campaigns\" against universities, making \"regulation by deal\" a broader model in higher education.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThese investigations follow U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon's statement that Columbia University's $221 million settlement would be a \"template for other universities.\" The probes aim to determine if Duke violated Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin for federally funded institutions.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Colliers' Q2 Revenue Jumps 18%, Engineering Soars Amid Infrastructure Boom\n\n**Key details:**\nColliers reported an 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.35 billion in its second-quarter 2025 earnings, benefiting from strong momentum across all three segments. The engineering segment specifically grew 67% to $436 million, capitalizing on tailwinds in infrastructure development and energy projects. While the real estate services segment grew 4%, global leasing saw a modest decline due to tariff-driven uncertainties, particularly in industrial. Colliers also acquired a 60% stake in Roundshield Partners and rebranded its investment management division as Harrison Street Asset Management. The company completed six tuck-in acquisitions, four in engineering and two in real estate services, to boost potential.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe significant 18% overall revenue growth and particularly strong 67% surge in the engineering segment indicate robust demand in infrastructure and energy, challenging any broad industry-wide slowdown perceptions. This performance suggests a differentiated strength within specific sub-sectors of the real estate and engineering industry. Despite modest global leasing declines in real estate services, the company's expectation of a healthy Q3 and Q4 uptick suggests potential for recovery in that segment, possibly surprising those anticipating continued weakness. Strategic acquisitions in European credit platforms and engineering consulting demonstrate Colliers' proactive expansion into new capabilities and markets, potentially enhancing long-term value creation.\n\n**The big picture:**\nColliers operates as a diversified real estate services and engineering company, reporting performance across its various business segments. The engineering division boasts a substantial backlog of work, indicating sustained demand for its specialized services in infrastructure and energy. In contrast, the real estate services segment has navigated global leasing challenges in the first half of the year, primarily due to tariff-related and other macroeconomic uncertainties impacting industrial volumes. To bolster its capabilities and market reach, Colliers is actively pursuing strategic acquisitions, including a significant stake in a European credit platform and several engineering consulting firms.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **18%**: Year-over-year total revenue growth.\n*   **$1.35 billion**: Total revenue for Q2 2025.\n*   **67%**: Year-over-year engineering segment revenue increase.\n*   **$436 million**: Engineering segment revenue.\n*   **12 months**: Value of engineering work backlog as revenue.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Colliers:** Real estate services and engineering company reporting strong Q2 2025 earnings.\n*   **Christian Mayer:** Colliers CFO, expressed confidence in the engineering business revenue pipeline.\n*   **Roundshield Partners:** European credit platform where Colliers acquired a 60% stake.\n*   **Harrison Street Asset Management:** New name for Colliers' rebranded investment management division.\n*   **Terra Consulting Group:** Acquired Chicago-based telecom infrastructure consulting firm.\n*   **Higher Ground Consulting:** Acquired geotechnical and environmental specialist in Western Canada.\n*   **Herold Engineering:** Acquired engineering consulting firm based in British Columbia.\n*   **Cambium:** Acquired engineering consulting firm based in Ontario.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Colliers anticipates a healthy uptick in leasing activity during the third and fourth quarters.\n*   This expected uptick is crucial for the company to achieve its full-year, mid-single-digit growth target for real estate services.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nColliers sees strong engineering growth and strategic buys despite some real estate leasing challenges.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nNorth American data centers and networks helped drive growth \u201caligned with expectations\u201d in the first half of 2025, Schneider Electric said Thursday in an earnings update .\n\nThe energy management giant expects growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as it adjusts to U.S. tariffs. It sees double-digit annual growth for its data centers and networks segment and mid- to high- single-digit growth for its infrastructure and industry segments through 2027.\n\nTwo recent moves will bolster Schneider\u2019s competitive advantage in the data center business, executives told investors and analysts on an early-Thursday call: its acquisition of a majority stake in cooling solutions provider Motivair earlier this year and a partnership with NVIDIA to develop optimized data center reference designs.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSchneider\u2019s revenues grew 8% and net income increased 6% in H1 2025, the company reported. North America was its strongest geography, with 13.8% organic revenue growth propelled by a 15.9% jump in revenue from its energy management group, which includes its data centers and networks business.\n\nContinued strong performance in Schneider\u2019s data center and networks vertical appeared to validate executives\u2019 comments earlier this year that the emergence of more efficient AI models like DeepSeek would not meaningfully impact technology companies\u2019 investment plans.\n\nCEO Olivier Blum said the Motivair acquisition would help Schneider maintain its \u201cleading position\u201d in the space with a full data center efficiency solution \u201cfrom grid to chip and chip to chiller.\u201d In its partnership with NVIDIA, the company expects to work on \u201cwhat will be their next chips [and] what are the designs we need to provide [to] make sure data centers are more efficient\u201d using those new chips, Blum said.\n\nSchneider announced a separate collaboration with ETAP earlier this year to produce digital twins that simulate data center operations, helping developers and future occupants optimize efficiency and performance before facilities are built.\n\nIn its buildings vertical, Schneider\u2019s EcoStruxure for Buildings platform and majority ownership of building management software provider Planon helped it slash key customers\u2019 building energy consumption to around 30% of the global average for comparable facilities, the company said. In case studies it shared, an upgrade to an uninterrupted power unit at a cancer hospital in India helped it improve energy efficiency by 30% and an occupancy-based room conditioning system at a London corporate headquarters helped it achieve 22% savings in operational energy use and carbon intensity.\n\nThe EcoStruxure solutions span a range of onsite power management, efficiency and decarbonization solutions for commercial and industrial facilities, the company says.\n\nLast year, for example, Schneider unveiled a battery energy storage system to support self-contained microgrids that can reduce heavy power users\u2019 peak energy demand \u2014 a costly operational expense. Data center developers and operators are likewise turning to flexible onsite power solutions that \u201cisland\u201d from the main grid to bypass grid connection queues that can stretch for years.\n\nBusiness environment\n\nSchneider said unfavorable foreign exchange dynamics reduced Schneider\u2019s global group revenues by 2.1%, mainly due to weakening of the U.S. dollar, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and Mexican peso relative to the euro, the home currency of the France-based company. Schneider has substantial manufacturing operations in the United States, India, Turkiye and Mexico.\n\nEconomists blame the decline in the U.S. dollar this year on a \u201crisk premium\u201d caused by mounting federal debt and the Trump administration\u2019s unpredictable trade policy.\n\nU.S. tariffs and inflation for raw materials were further headwinds for Schneider in the first half, offsetting productivity gains in a trend that Chief Financial Officer Hilary Maxson said could continue through the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cDepending on [the] timing of various tariff actions in the U.S., we\u2019d now expect our gross margin progression for the full year could be somewhat negative,\u201d Maxson said Thursday.\n\nBut Schneider\u2019s \"demonstrated pricing power\u201d ought to help the company \u201cfully offset the impacts of tariffs and inflation over the next quarters,\u201d she said.\n\nSchneider mounted a quick response to tariffs during the first months of the Trump administration, but the benefits may not be apparent until the company reports its second-half performance early next year, Blum said.\n\nSchneider\u2019s actions so far include \u201cmost of the price increase\u201d that customers will see as a result of the tariffs imposed so far, though \u201cif there are further actions to be implemented depending on the latest news, of course we will continue to do more,\u201d he said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Schneider Electric's Data Center Growth Powers H1 Amid Tariff Headwinds.\n\n**Key details:** Schneider Electric announced H1 2025 growth aligned with expectations, primarily driven by North American data centers and networks. Revenues grew 8% and net income increased 6% for the period. The company anticipates accelerated growth in the second half of 2025, projecting double-digit annual growth for its data centers and networks segment through 2027. Strategic moves including the Motivair acquisition and a partnership with NVIDIA aim to enhance its competitive position in the data center business.\n\n**Why it matters:** Schneider Electric's continued strong data center performance suggests that efficient AI models like DeepSeek are not meaningfully impacting technology companies' investment plans, validating earlier executive comments. This challenges a potential consensus view that AI efficiency might reduce data center demand. While U.S. tariffs and raw material inflation posed headwinds, the company's \"demonstrated pricing power\" is expected to offset these impacts in coming quarters, indicating resilience.\n\n**The big picture:** Schneider Electric, an energy management giant, reported H1 2025 results while navigating a complex business environment. The company operates across various segments including data centers, infrastructure, and buildings, offering solutions like its EcoStruxure platform. It faces macroeconomic headwinds such as unfavorable foreign exchange dynamics, primarily due to a weakening U.S. dollar, and ongoing U.S. tariffs alongside raw material inflation. Despite these challenges, Schneider has implemented pricing adjustments in response to tariffs and continues to develop new solutions for energy management and efficiency.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Revenues grew 8% in H1 2025.\n*   Net income increased 6% in H1 2025.\n*   North America organic revenue growth was 13.8%.\n*   North America energy management group revenue jumped 15.9%.\n*   Unfavorable foreign exchange dynamics reduced global group revenues by 2.1%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Schneider Electric**: Energy management giant reporting strong H1 2025 growth, driven by data centers.\n*   **Motivair**: Cooling solutions provider; Schneider Electric acquired a majority stake earlier this year.\n*   **NVIDIA**: Partnered with Schneider Electric to develop optimized data center reference designs.\n*   **Olivier Blum**: Schneider Electric CEO, discussed acquisitions, partnerships, and tariff responses.\n*   **ETAP**: Collaborated with Schneider Electric on digital twins for data center operations.\n*   **Planon**: Building management software provider, majority-owned by Schneider Electric, aiding energy efficiency.\n*   **Hilary Maxson**: Schneider Electric CFO, addressed tariff impacts and the company's pricing power.\n*   **DeepSeek**: An efficient AI model whose emergence was not expected to impact technology investment plans.\n*   **Trump administration**: Its trade policy and tariffs impacted Schneider Electric's business environment.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for Schneider Electric's second-half performance report early next year for tariff impact visibility.\n*   Monitor gross margin progression for the full year, as it could be somewhat negative due to tariffs.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Schneider Electric's data center strength and strategic moves bolster growth despite tariff headwinds.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMore people would avoid a public space because of odors than if there were a known virus outbreak, according to a survey released Tuesday.\n\nOdor, stuffiness and dust guide people\u2019s real-time decisions on whether to return to an office, school, store or gym, according to indoor air quality provider GPS Air\u2019s survey of 1,000 U.S. adults, conducted in May.\n\nNearly half of respondents were more likely to think about indoor air quality when the air smelled strange or stale, outweighing cues like coughing or sneezing (28%), or personal allergic reactions (13%), according to the GPS Air report.\n\nThe importance of sensory perception contributes to a misconception about indoor air quality, other research shows. For example, although more than half of respondents in another survey said they believe plants significantly improve indoor air quality, the effects of plants on air quality is minimal, a Drexel University paper says.\n\nIn the GPS Air survey, 41% of respondents said that odors would keep them from returning to a facility compared to 34% who said the same about a virus outbreak. \u201cThese findings illustrate how perception, particularly driven by smell and visible cues, continues to shape public understanding and expectations around indoor air quality,\u201d GPS Air says.\n\nPeople also want proof of air quality, with 61% saying they would trust a space more if they knew it monitored indoor air quality and 65% saying businesses should be required to display indoor air scores, like health ratings.\n\nGrowth in healthy building certifications, like the International WELL Building Institute\u2019s WELL rating system, launched in 2014, suggest the facility industry is responding to the growing awareness of IAQ. The rating system covers more than 6 billion square feet of real estate, representing nearly 100,000 locations and a twelve-fold increase since early 2020, IWBI said in July.\n\n\u201cThis milestone reflects a new paradigm: prioritizing health isn\u2019t a cost, it\u2019s a catalyst,\u201d IWBI President and CEO Rachel Hodgdon said in a statement. \u201cSix billion square feet is not only 13 times more than the office space in Los Angeles, it\u2019s just shy of the total commercial space of the United Kingdom. \u2026 The current scale of WELL \u2026 is staggering, and the pace of adoption is equally extraordinary.\u201d\n\nIndoor air quality affects business\n\nAbout two-thirds of respondents in GPS Air\u2019s survey said they\u2019d switch gyms for better filtration, even if it costs more, and over half said they would choose a hotel with cleaner air if they had a choice.\n\nThe preference for clean-air buildings is reflected in market trends. Buildings with healthy building certifications can earn rent premiums between 4.4% and 7.7% more per square foot than other buildings, as well as longer lease terms. \u201cBuildings that support tenant health and well-being generate greater demand and rent premiums,\u201d IWBI says.\n\n\u201cWhile consumers may not be willing to pay significantly more, they are ready to walk away from options that feel unsafe or neglected,\u201d GPS Air says. The report notes that businesses visibly prioritizing indoor air quality may gain a competitive edge, especially in industries where customers have choices.\n\n\u201cTo close this perception gap, the next frontier isn\u2019t just cleaner air, but confidence in it,\u201d GPS Air says. \u201cThat means making air quality something people can see, not just assume.\u201d\n\nAir monitoring will continue to move front and center, according to Tony Abate, vice president and chief technology at AtmosAir Solutions. Abate is a member of the ASHRAE Standards Committee and started an ASHRAE Technical Committee, TG2.IAQMP, or Indoor Air Quality Monitoring Devices.\n\n\u201cWithin about five years, I believe smart thermostats will have air quality displays on them, so there will be air monitoring in just about any space that will tell you what\u2019s going on with your indoor air quality,\u201d Abate told Facilities Dive. \u201cI think smartphones will start to incorporate indoor air quality in some very basic way. So it\u2019s important that people get ahead of that curve and start to understand what\u2019s going on in your space and what you can do about it before it becomes an emergency.\u201d",

Unlike other cohorts, Gen Z also specifically doubts the security and flexibility these jobs offer. This contrasts sharply with older generations, who perceive more opportunities and higher pay in the trades.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis generational misperception presents a direct challenge to employers, who are already deemphasizing four-year degrees in favor of skilled trade candidates. The article explicitly states that \"skilled labor shortages are no longer hypothetical\" and are \"disrupting industries right now.\" This information challenges any current consensus view that industries have a stable labor supply or that traditional educational paths are meeting industry demands.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Stanley Black & Decker hikes prices again, battles tariffs for margins.\n\n**Key details:** Stanley Black & Decker plans a \"more modest\" round of price increases starting in the fourth quarter, following high single-digit hikes in April. The company aims for 35% adjusted gross margins, despite ongoing tariff costs which it now forecasts as an $800 million gross impact for 2025. It generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2, contributing to a multi-year $2 billion savings program by 2025. The company also anticipates a 65-cent negative earnings per share impact from tariffs in 2025, 10 cents lower than prior estimates.\n\n**Why it matters:** The company's ability to implement price hikes without a noticeable \"shift in buying trends\" suggests resilient demand for its products. This might challenge a consensus view anticipating consumer pushback to rising prices in a volatile economic climate. Management believes Q2 was the low point for gross margins, indicating a potential recovery path. These strategic actions demonstrate the company's commitment to profitability amid persistent external cost pressures.\n\n**The big picture:** Stanley Black & Decker, the world\u2019s largest toolmaker, is focused on mitigating the impact of tariff volatility on trade and commerce. Its strategy includes leveraging supply chain adjustments, such as reducing China production to less than 5% by 2026, and targeted pricing actions. The company is also collaborating with customers on cost-effective products and engaging the U.S. administration on trade goals. These efforts are part of a broader plan to improve profitability in an uncertain economic backdrop.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $3.9 billion (2% decline from last year).\n*   Q2 net earnings: $101.9 million (compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024).\n*   Q2 gross margin: 27% (down 140 basis points from last year).\n*   Forecasted gross tariff cost impact for 2025: $800 million (excluding mitigation efforts).\n*   Expected negative earnings per share impact from tariffs for 2025: 65 cents (10 cents lower than Q1 estimate).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Stanley Black & Decker:** World\u2019s largest toolmaker, implementing new price increases and cost reduction programs.\n*   **Christopher Nelson:** COO, discussed price talks, named CEO successor, cited efficient supply chain.\n*   **Donald Allan:** CEO, stated Q2 was gross margin low point, becomes executive chairman in October.\n*   **Patrick Hallinan:** CFO, updated investors on the potential tariff cost impact calculations for 2025.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A \"more modest\" round of price increases is expected to commence in the fourth quarter.\n*   Donald Allan is scheduled to transition to executive chairman, with Christopher Nelson assuming the CEO role, effective October.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Strategic price hikes and supply chain shifts aim to boost margins despite ongoing tariff headwinds.",

JCI\u2019s fire and security segment saw slower growth amid \u201cproduct gaps,\u201d CEO Joakim Weidemanis said on an investor call Tuesday.\n\nJCI is developing a new business system to make its operations and sales processes more efficient as it undertakes a strategic review that \u201cover the next couple months will start to draw conclusions about what our portfolio will look like moving forward,\u201d Weidemanis said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn his second earnings call since taking the top job at Johnson Controls in March, Weidemanis detailed his vision for a leaner, more nimble company.\n\nWeidemanis highlighted two early deployments of JCI\u2019s new business system that he said have begun to bear fruit, including a plan to streamline commercial HVAC sales processes that could eventually slash sales times in half. A similar initiative on the operations side could halve equipment lead times for chillers in North America while normalizing inventory levels and boosting factory output, without corresponding capital investments, he said.\n\nJCI sees those efforts as key to its advantage in the high-demand data center market, where customers value shorter lead times, Weidemanis said. They could eventually extend to its slower-growing fire and security business line, he added.\n\n\u201cBeing able to deliver faster than others is an important part of our competitive advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new CEO\u2019s vision for a more efficient company apparently extends beyond sales and operations to core internal functions like accounting. The company is improving what Weidemanis called its \u201cfirst-pass yield on customers paying invoices\u201d in an effort to reduce billing error rates and improve the customer experience.\n\n\u201cIf you have a couple of percent of invoicing errors that you need to redo versus less than 1%, that not only impacts customer satisfaction, but of course, also your cash flow,\u201d he said.\n\nThese process improvements should strengthen JCI\u2019s financial position over time as the effects of the sale of its residential and light commercial business last year roll off its balance sheet and tariff impacts lessen, said Chief Financial Officer Marc Vandiepenbeeck.\n\nVandienpenbeeck described the hit from the Trump administration\u2019s on-again, off-again import tariffs as mixed but manageable. Johnson Controls has passed more of the pricing impact from tariffs to customers in markets where it had strong pricing power and less of the impact in more competitive markets, but the environment remains \u201cdynamic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s [still] a bit of uncertainty on what tariffs will do on the bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we've executed very well, but we've taken [a] conservative view into the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIn its second quarter earning report for fiscal year 2025, published about a month after Trump\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement, JCI said it would mitigate the levies\u2019 expected 2% to 3% bottom-line impact through a combination of pass-through pricing, change orders, regionalized manufacturing and investments in more resilient supply chains.\n\nDespite uncertainty around global trade flows, JCI\u2019s Americas order backlog grew 10% in the third quarter \u201cat record levels,\u201d Weidemanis said. A growth in orders for systems \u2014 such as HVAC equipment and controls \u2014 outpaced growth in orders for services, which Weidemanis flagged as a possible growth area in the coming quarters.\n\nThe CEO also noted an intent to enhance investment in research and development to accelerate innovation.\n\n\u201cIn some businesses, we can add more differentiated service products to our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we talk about investments in innovation, we are talking not only about systems but service products as well \u2026 to deliver more outcome-oriented services.\u201d\n\nBut Weidemanis also suggested JCI services and its fire and security business line could face scrutiny from the company\u2019s strategic review. JCI\u2019s focus on \u201cthe premium or more sophisticated side of the market\u201d for fire detection puts it at a disadvantage to competitors like Honeywell and Allegion, he said.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we're working away at the strategic review of the portfolio diligently [and] thoughtfully,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we have a conclusion, we will certainly let you know.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRelationship building is the most important skill Robert Alemany says he brings to his role as director of facilities at The Buckley School, a private K-9 school in New York City.\n\nRobert Alemany Permission granted by The Buckley School, NYC\n\nWith a background in teaching and business management, he had to learn the technical side of facility management from scratch when he shifted to that line of work about five years ago. Yet it\u2019s people management that he relies on most to succeed in his role overseeing a four-building campus of close to 400 students, he says.\n\nAmong his big challenges this year is meeting the energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One of the school\u2019s older buildings needs upgrades if it\u2019s to meet the city\u2019s tough building performance standards. To learn about his career path and how he\u2019s tackling the challenges that come with the job, Facilities Dive sat down with Alemany for a short conversation.\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nFACILITIES DIVE: How did you become involved in facilities management?\n\nROBERT ALEMANY: It was accidental. I started out teaching at public schools in different roles. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher forever and got an MBA. I thought I'd go work in finance, but I kept getting these managerial roles at educational places, then got a job at a church in New York City. The church bought a parking garage, gutted it and turned it into this really contemporary facility. They decided that Monday through Saturday they would rent it out as space and just use it for church on Sundays. They used the income from the event space to pay off the mortgage.\n\nI ran operations there for a while. They had somebody taking care of the building [who departed, then they] said, \u201cWhy don't you step into this role?\u201d I was like, \u201cI really appreciate it, but I don\u2019t know which way to hold a screwdriver, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m your guy.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe appreciate your management skills and the kind of person you are. You can get the skills to excel in this role,\u201d and they gave me a shot. I started cold calling facilities managers in similar roles, getting books and doing online courses and just loved it.\n\nA few years down the line, a position opened up at the school I\u2019m at now and I thought it was a perfect fit; I had these newly acquired facility skills and I\u2019d been a teacher. I know what they experience every day. That led me to where I am now.\n\nTalk about your training.\n\nI continue to build off what I learned and got my real estate license. I still talk to people in the field, invest in books and do online courses whenever I can. You just never stop talking to people. Even when we have vendors come in, I ask, \u201cWhy? What kind of stuff are you doing here?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important skill the job requires?\n\nPeople management, which is not something that [typically] comes to mind. When people think of facilities, they think of pipes and HVAC systems and all that. But there are people that are involved in maintaining and repairing that equipment. So it\u2019s about building relationships, especially in a city as busy as New York City. To get emergency service here, for example, relationships make a difference. We might not be on the top of the list of a company. We\u2019re just a small fish in the pond. But by building relationships, we become a priority for others. And when you have to negotiate contracts and work through different things, people skills are at the top.\n\nAre there laws or regulations that cause you the most challenge? How do you manage compliance?\n\nHere in New York City, it's Local Law 97 which is the law that's governing carbon emissions. One of the buildings was last renovated in 1974. We're fine for this year, but by 2030 we're not going to meet the threshold that they've set. We're going to be fined about $35,000 or something like that. So we're undergoing a renovation project and engaging architects and some engineers to help us with that to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nAs it relates to school buildings, some of it is health department stuff because we\u2019ve got a nurse here. So, it\u2019s making sure that chemical cleaners are away and out of reach of kids. We also face a lot of the regulations that other buildings do, but when they come in and do their inspections, they\u2019re a lot stricter with us because we\u2019re a school.\n\nWhat keeps you up at night?\n\nJust the idea that every facilities manager has: that something weird is going to go wrong, where you forgot if you did something or forgot to talk to someone. The unexpected. But that comes with the role. There\u2019s a level of unpredictability, but it drives you to be as well organized as you can and think through things. Even if something doesn\u2019t happen, you think through multiple steps and say, \u201cOkay, if it did, what would I do? How would I respond?\u201d\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone who\u2019s interested in becoming a facility manager?\n\nBe humble, ask questions and learn from those around you. There are a lot of people that have done this before, and it's not just facility managers, but those that have worked in the trades that love to share their passion for what they do. Don\u2019t try to re-create the wheel. Absorb knowledge and create friendships and relationships. If anybody would want to pursue the career, I would encourage them to do it, because it really is a great career.\n\nDid you have a unique journey into facilities management? Are you managing through challenges others could benefit from learning about? If you\u2019re interested in sharing your story with others in your field, Facilities Dive would appreciate hearing from you. Send an email to [email protected].",

He oversees a four-building campus for close to 400 students. A key challenge is meeting energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One older school building requires upgrades to avoid significant fines by 2030 due to this law.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article highlights that New York City's Local Law 97 necessitates significant, costly renovations for older buildings. This regulatory pressure presents substantial financial implications for institutions, including schools. It challenges the common perception that facilities management is solely a technical field. Instead, it emphasizes the critical role of people management and relationship building for operational success, emergency services, and contract negotiations in a dense urban environment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nRobert Alemany's entry into facilities management was accidental, following a career in teaching and business management. He transitioned into the role at a church based on his managerial skills, learning technical aspects on the job. His current position at The Buckley School allows him to combine his newly acquired facility skills with his teaching background. This background helps him understand the daily experiences of the school's faculty and staff.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   K-9 school\n*   Four-building campus\n*   Close to 400 students\n*   One building last renovated in 1974\n*   Anticipated fine by 2030: about $35,000\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Robert Alemany:** Director of facilities at The Buckley School, emphasizing people management over technical skills.\n*   **The Buckley School:** Private K-9 school in NYC facing Local Law 97 renovation challenges and potential fines.\n*   **Facilities Dive:** Interviewed Robert Alemany to detail his career path and management challenges.\n*   **New York City:** Imposed Local Law 97, governing carbon emissions and impacting city buildings.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Buckley School is engaging architects and engineers for a renovation project to meet Local Law 97 requirements.\n*   This project aims to reduce the school's carbon footprint and avoid future fines by 2030.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFacilities management now demands people skills and navigating strict environmental regulations.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nOklo announced two partnerships last week to bring its vision of efficient, nuclear-powered data centers closer to fruition.\n\nIt plans to co-develop advanced power and thermal management solutions with Vertiv, a provider of data center cooling systems and other digital infrastructure, and deploy Liberty Energy\u2019s natural gas generators and electric load management platform to power Oklo\u2019s future data center customers as federal regulators consider its advanced reactor design.\n\nIn press statements last week, executives from the three companies said the partnerships would future-proof the next generation of high-powered computing facilities, allowing them to run more efficiently and flexibly with less impact on local grids.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nData center developers are facing fierce local opposition in many parts of the United States. Data center proposals worth at least $64 billion have been blocked or delayed by community opposition, according to the activist group Data Center Watch.\n\nOpponents direct much of their ire to the impacts of onsite power generation and cooling systems on local environments and infrastructure.\n\nOnsite gas or diesel generators \u2014 which run around the clock to provide \u201cprime power\u201d at some facilities as their owners await a grid connection \u2014 are noisy and contribute to air pollution. Power demand from grid-connected data centers may fluctuate wildly in a matter of minutes, causing potentially costly power quality issues for nearby customers and the facilities themselves. Larger data centers\u2019 cooling systems can consume millions of gallons of water per day, which is one reason why the latest AI data center designs lean on closed water or non-water refrigerant loops for cooling.\n\nVertiv offers power management solutions to make \u201cdata centers good citizens on the grid,\u201d said Martin Olsen, the company\u2019s senior vice president of products and solutions. These solutions include uninterruptible power supply systems and larger batteries that help smooth out voltage fluctuations.\n\nVertiv\u2019s partnership with Oklo could boost the efficiency of high-density computing facilities more broadly, Olsen said.\n\nThe companies say they will work together to \u201cproduce end-to-end reference designs\u201d for heat recovery and cooling systems in data centers powered by Oklo\u2019s small nuclear reactors, each of which generates 5% to 10% as much energy as one of the larger reactors connected to the U.S. grid today.\n\nThose designs will closely integrate Vertiv\u2019s thermal management technology with onsite power generation, allowing facilities to recover and use heat that would otherwise go to waste, Olsen said.\n\n\u201cIn a nuclear power plant, about a third of the energy produces electricity and the rest is heat \u2026 normally, you dissipate that,\u201d he said.\n\nVertiv\u2019s thermal management system would recapture much of that heat and use it to run absorption chillers tied to facilities\u2019 liquid and air cooling systems. That could significantly reduce those systems\u2019 power consumption and cut \u201cstranded capacity\u201d \u2014 the power and mechanical capacity that would otherwise be needed to cool facilities at periods of peak demand \u2014 by 10% to 20%, Olsen said.\n\nData centers could simply bank the energy savings and use less power overall, but it\u2019s more likely they\u2019d run more GPUs instead, Olsen added.\n\nIt may be several years before a data center customer has the opportunity. The companies plan to demonstrate the co-designed power and thermal management solution with Oklo\u2019s first reactor deployment at Idaho National Laboratory.\n\nOklo executives say that reactor could power up in late 2027 or early 2028. They have not said whether it would be colocated with a data center or other power offtaker, though the Trump administration last week identified Idaho National Laboratory as one of four U.S. Department of Energy sites it wants to host \u201ccutting edge data center and power generation projects.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Oklo\u2019s collaboration with Liberty Energy and a previously announced partnership with RPower would deliver \u201cbridge power\u201d to future data center customers eager to power up before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves its reactor design. Both companies make small, flexible gas-fired generators that can run continuously to provide primary power to off-grid facilities or back up a grid connection and other onsite power sources as needed.\n\nThe Oklo-Liberty announcement suggested Oklo\u2019s reactors would relegate the gas generators to a backup role over time. But, as part of the partnership, Liberty said it would provide load management solutions that enable \u201cflexible energy services\u201d in the short term and \u201cfuture grid management services focused on optimization and resiliency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis collaboration gives large-scale power users a turnkey alternative that integrates generation, backup, grid interaction, and optimization, all through a single provider,\u201d Oklo cofounder and CEO Jacob DeWitte said in a statement.",

Goods that have been loaded onto vessels and/or are in transit to U.S. ports by the day the tariffs are implemented will not be subject to the duties as long as they are entered for consumption by Oct. 5.\n\n\n\nHowever, if U.S. Customs and Border Protection finds goods were \"transshipped to evade applicable duties,\u201d the products will instead face a 40% tariff, as well as additional penalties and fees, per the order.\n\nThe latest directive from Trump codifies the implementation of country-specific duties he first unveiled in April. After pausing those tariffs in favor of a baseline 10% levy, he later shared a series of letters on social media detailing modified country-specific rates that would begin Aug. 1.\n\nDuring the pause, the Trump administration reached tariff agreements and deal frameworks with multiple trading partners, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea.",

Imports from Canada, Mexico, and China will continue separate duties, while unlisted countries face a baseline 10% levy. Goods in transit by Aug. 7 are exempt if entered for consumption by Oct. 5.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis directive codifies previously unveiled country-specific duties, ending a pause that included a 10% baseline levy. It signifies a move towards differentiated trade policies, rewarding partners who engaged in negotiations and penalizing others.

This approach challenges any consensus view that the U.S. would maintain a uniform tariff structure or extend the pause indefinitely.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPresident Trump initially unveiled country-specific duties in April, which were then paused in favor of a 10% baseline levy.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe topic of tariffs loomed over Steve Madden\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, with company executives citing second quarter challenges including canceled wholesale orders, reduced open-to-buys and shipment delays.\n\nSteven Madden is still focused on diversifying its sourcing base, an initiative it started after President Donald Trump was reelected last November. In its first quarter, the company said it planned to only source a mid-teens percentage of goods from China.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, Chairman and CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company moved some of its production back to China for the fall because \u201cwe felt it would be difficult to ensure on-time delivery, appropriate product quality and/or reasonable pricing\u201d if it sourced from another country.\n\nFor fall 2025, Steve Madden expects to source about 30% of its imports from China, down from 71% a year ago, per the call. Rosenfeld said Steve Madden\u2019s China sourcing percentage is currently in the low 60s. He attributed the change to shifting tariff rates between the U.S. and China, which at one point were as high as 145%.\n\nSteve Madden previously planned to move some of its China sourcing to Brazil, but following Trump\u2019s announcement of a 40% tariff on the South American country, the company plans to \u201cwait and see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just for Brazil, but for a lot of countries that we work with,\u201d Rosenfeld said.\n\nTo make up for some of the tariff impact, Steve Madden has selectively raised prices for wholesale customers and individual consumers, with price increases averaging about 10%.\n\nSo far, customers have been receptive to price increases, but Rosenfeld cautioned it was still early, and the company would continue to monitor consumer demand.\n\nTariffs have always been a particular challenge for Steve Madden. Unlike some other apparel and footwear companies, it used to source about 80% of its products from China. Mexico, another target for Trump tariffs, also was a large portion of Steve Madden\u2019s sourcing base, Fashion Dive previously reported.\n\nDespite these challenges, Steve Madden still logged a revenue increase for Q2 with $559 million, a 6.8% year-over-year increase. This was mainly due to the newly acquired Kurt Geiger brand. Without Kurt Geiger, revenue would have fallen 10%, according to Jefferies analysts led by Corey Tarlowe.\n\nSteve Madden reported a Q2 loss from operations of $40.3 million or a 7.2% decrease of revenue, compared to income from operations of $46.9 million last year.\n\n\u201cOur financial performance in the second quarter was not up to our usual standards as we grappled with the impact of tariffs, and we know the path forward will continue to be bumpy in the near term,\u201d Rosenfeld said.\n\nThe largest tariff-related impact was seen in mass and off-price channels. Rosenfeld said that about 95% of the wholesale revenue shortfall of the business came from these segments.\n\nRosenfeld declined to give guidance for the company\u2019s performance expectations for the next quarter or the full year, but said the tariff situation would make a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Q3 and would hopefully improve by Q4.\n\nSteve Madden\u2019s overall wholesale business fell 6.4% year over year. Without Kurt Geiger, it would have fallen 12.8%. DTC revenue rose 43.3%, or fell 3% excluding Kurt Geiger.\n\n\u201cWhile the systems migration is fully behind them, the tariff-related demand impact is likely to remain at least through the end of the year,\u201d Tom Nikic, managing director of Needham & Company, said in a client note.\n\nIn addition to Kurt Geiger and its namesake brand, Steve Madden also owns Almost Famous, Dolce Vita and Betsey Johnson.",

        "summary": "**Steve Madden Navigates Tariffs, Revenue Volatility Amid Shifting Sourcing**\n\n**Key details:** Steve Madden cited Q2 challenges including canceled wholesale orders, reduced open-to-buys, and shipment delays, attributing them to tariffs. The company moved some fall production back to China, stating difficulties in ensuring on-time delivery, product quality, or reasonable pricing from other countries. For fall 2025, Steve Madden expects to source about 30% of its imports from China, a significant drop from 71% a year ago. To offset tariff impacts, Steve Madden selectively raised prices for wholesale and individual customers by approximately 10%. The company reported a Q2 loss from operations of $40.3 million, compared to income last year.\n\n**Why it matters:** Steve Madden's decision to move some fall production back to China, despite ongoing diversification efforts, suggests the difficulties and costs of completely shifting supply chains are more complex than anticipated. This challenges the idea of a straightforward pivot away from China for the industry. The company's Q2 operating loss and decline in core wholesale business, masked by an acquisition, indicates underlying profitability pressures. Management's refusal to provide future guidance underscores significant uncertainty for investors regarding near-term performance. The tariff impact being concentrated in mass and off-price channels points to specific challenges for accessible price points.\n\n**The big picture:** Steve Madden initiated an initiative to diversify its sourcing base after President Donald Trump's reelection last November. The company had previously planned to source only a mid-teens percentage of goods from China. Tariffs have historically posed a particular challenge for Steve Madden, as it used to source around 80% of its products from China. Shifting tariff rates, which at one point reached 145%, significantly influenced the company's sourcing decisions. Furthermore, plans to move sourcing to Brazil were put on hold following Trump's announcement of a 40% tariff on the South American country.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 Revenue: $559 million\n*   Year-over-year Q2 revenue increase: 6.8%\n*   Revenue fall without Kurt Geiger: 10%\n*   Q2 loss from operations: $40.3 million\n*   Wholesale business fall year over year: 6.4%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Steven Madden:** Footwear and accessories company that faced Q2 challenges from tariffs, impacting sourcing and profitability.\n*   **Edward Rosenfeld:** Chairman and CEO of Steve Madden, who discussed sourcing decisions and declined future financial guidance.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** His reelection and tariff announcements influenced Steve Madden's sourcing strategy and trade decisions.\n*   **Kurt Geiger:** Newly acquired brand that significantly boosted Steve Madden's Q2 revenue.\n*   **Jefferies:** Investment bank whose analysts noted Steve Madden's revenue would have fallen 10% without Kurt Geiger.\n*   **Corey Tarlowe:** Lead analyst at Jefferies, who provided analysis on Steve Madden's Q2 revenue performance.\n*   **Tom Nikic:** Managing director of Needham & Company, who stated tariff-related demand impact likely remains through year-end.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The tariff situation is expected to have a \"significant impact\" on Q3 performance.\n*   The company will continue to monitor consumer demand regarding price increases.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Tariff impacts continue challenging Steve Madden's sourcing, profitability, and future outlook.",

Leather Goods and Saddlery posted an 11.3% increase for the half, but watches were down nearly 9% for the period.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile luxury firms, such as Kering and LVMH, have reported revenue declines amid sector difficulties, Herm\u00e8s continues to post year-over-year increases.\n\n\u201cHerm\u00e8s has consistently focused on scarcity, craftsmanship, and brand equity, rather than chasing aggressive volume growth,\u201d Yanmei Tang, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge, said in emailed comments. \u201cIts approach appears well-suited to a market where high-end consumers are becoming more selective and emotionally connected to brands.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, revenue was up 10.7% to 1.8 billion euros for the first half, although second quarter revenue in France grew only 4.1%, down from 14.2% growth in the country in the first quarter. In the Middle East, revenue rose 16.3% to 362 million euros.\n\nThe Americas were up 9.5% to 1.5 billion euros, with a 6.3% increase in the second quarter that came despite the company\u2019s price increases in the U.S., which Herm\u00e8s instituted to offset tariffs. On a call with analysts, Axel Dumas, executive chairman of Herm\u00e8s, said that the company was waiting for more clarification on the new U.S./EU tariff structure, but for the moment the company did not plan any additional price increases.\n\nAsia was up 4.2% to 4.4 billion euros in H1, mainly due to a 17.6% year-over-year uptick in Japan. The Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan was up only 1.5% for the first half, and nearly flat in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe solid first-half results across all regions reflect the strength of the Herm\u00e8s model,\u201d Dumas said in the release. \u201cI would like to thank all our customers for their trust and all our employees for their commitment. We will continue to invest and recruit to ensure the group\u2019s sustained success.\u201d\n\nTang said that while the overall luxury market in China is cooling, Herm\u00e8s has avoided heavy promotional campaigns and has not overextended itself in terms of product range or store expansion.\n\n\u201cThe brand\u2019s disciplined retail strategy and selective investment in China are also paying off,\u201d Tang said. \u201cRather than flooding the market, Herm\u00e8s has maintained a focused footprint and high store productivity. Our experts say this has helped the brand avoid the fatigue now visible in some of its competitors.\u201d\n\nTang said that looking ahead, Herm\u00e8s may be better positioned to weather market volatility than some of its peers, which are undergoing leadership changes or restructuring.\n\n\u201cHerm\u00e8s is expected to maintain internal stability over the next three to five years,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThis continuity, combined with its ability to execute targeted product launches and deepen relationships with existing clients, may allow the brand to continue gaining market share even in a flat or slow-growth environment.\u201d",

Second-quarter revenue grew 5.6% to \u20ac3.9 billion, representing a slowdown from previous quarters. All geographies showed overall first-half revenue increases, though regional growth was more moderate in Q2.

This performance challenges the broader luxury industry consensus of widespread downturns. Analysts suggest Herm\u00e8s' focus on scarcity, craftsmanship, and brand equity resonates with selective high-end consumers. Its disciplined retail strategy and avoidance of heavy promotions in key markets like China have also helped it evade market fatigue seen in competitors.\n\n**The big picture:** The broader luxury sector is facing difficulties, with firms like Kering and LVMH reporting revenue declines. In this context, Herm\u00e8s has pursued a distinct strategy, focusing on scarcity, craftsmanship, and brand equity rather than aggressive volume growth.

The change means low-cost imports will be subject to all applicable duties, including the various tariffs that have been installed by the Trump administration.\n\nAn exception is provided for imported goods sent through the international postal network.

This methodology will be available for six months, after which applicable shipments must comply with the ad valorem duty.\n\n\"The postal channel has always been difficult, namely because of the lack of traceability and the amount of consumer to consumer volume that is shipped there,\" said Hugo Pakula, CEO of supply chain compliance solutions provider Tru Identity, in a LinkedIn post Wednesday.\n\nThe end of the exemption will help the U.S. prevent importers from avoiding tariffs and combat the entry of drugs and \"other unsafe or below-market products\" that cause harm, per the fact sheet.

The brand also is seeking monetary damages.\n\nIn 2023, the sportswear company said the two groups entered a written agreement whereby the university could use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name, for which the sportswear company has a trademark, if the name was used with one other distinguishing mark associated with the university, such as its shield, crown or lion mascot logo, or words, such as \u201cuniversity,\u201d \u201cColumbia Law,\u201d or its year of founding.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Columbia Sportswear is headquartered in Portland, Oregon.\n\nSome of the Columbia University apparel mentioned in the lawsuit include the Nike and Champion logos, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say can create customer confusion and a false association between Columbia Sportswear and its competitors.\n\nAn example of Columbia University\u2019s allegedly infringing products. Retrieved from Court Filing\n\n\u201cThough Columbia Sportswear and Nike are headquartered in the same State and are both highly reputable sporting apparel designers and have a generally friendly relationship, the two companies have never collaborated to jointly design, manufacture, market, or sell any product,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA consumer looking at the Infringing Merchandise would never know that, and, in fact, would reasonably be induced into believing the companies had.\u201d\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this case will be settled out of court, and fairly quickly, said Josh Gerben, trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Columbia Sportswear\u2019s version of the story in the complaint is not entirely accurate, and Columbia University decides to defend the case, things could get interesting,\u201d Gerben said in an email. \u201cThis is because Columbia University has been around much longer than Columbia Sportswear. It gives the university some very interesting defenses to the overall claims regarding trademark infringement.\u201d\n\nColumbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday. In Q1, the company reported a net sales increase of 1% to $778.5 million. At the time of the announcement, the company withdrew its full-year financial outlook due to economic uncertainty related to tariffs.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Columbia Sportswear sues university over trademark, alleging contract breach.\n\n**Key details:** Columbia Sportswear is suing Columbia University for trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract. The lawsuit alleges the university violated a 2023 written agreement by selling apparel using \"Columbia\" alone. The agreement stipulated the university could only use \"Columbia\" with a distinguishing mark or additional words. Columbia Sportswear is seeking a jury trial, injunctions against future use, product recall, and monetary damages.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit highlights a potential breach of a 2023 agreement regarding brand usage for Columbia University. For Columbia Sportswear, it's about protecting its trademark and preventing alleged customer confusion. The inclusion of Nike and Champion logos on allegedly infringing products suggests potential for false association, challenging a view of clear brand distinction. The outcome could affect merchandise sales for the university and set precedents for trademark enforcement in apparel.\n\n**The big picture:** The lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, where Columbia Sportswear is headquartered. The core of the dispute is a 2023 written agreement about the university's use of the \"Columbia\" name. A trademark attorney suggests the case will likely settle quickly out of court. However, he noted Columbia University's long history could offer \"interesting defenses\" if it decides to defend.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Lawsuit filed last week.\n* Written agreement between parties entered in 2023.\n* Columbia Sportswear Q1 net sales increased 1% to $778.5 million.\n* Company withdrew full-year financial outlook due to economic uncertainty related to tariffs.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* **Columbia Sportswear:** Suing Columbia University for alleged trademark infringement and breach of a 2023 contract.\n* **Columbia University:** Facing a lawsuit from Columbia Sportswear for allegedly violating a trademark agreement on apparel.\n* **Nike:** A competitor mentioned as having its logo on allegedly infringing Columbia University apparel.\n* **Champion:** A competitor mentioned as having its logo on allegedly infringing Columbia University apparel.\n* **Josh Gerben:** Trademark attorney offering expert opinion on the lawsuit's likely out-of-court settlement.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* Columbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Lawsuit over \"Columbia\" trademark usage creates uncertainty for both parties.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThom Browne CEO Rodrigo Bazan is stepping down from his role effective Aug. 31, according to a Wednesday press release from parent company Ermenegildo Zegna Group.\n\nBazan has led the Thom Browne brand since 2016. Sam Lobban, who is currently executive vice president and general merchandising manager for apparel and designer at Nordstrom, will succeed Bazan on Sept. 2, per the release.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day Zegna Group reported a 3% year-over-year revenue decline to 927.7 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, for the first half of fiscal 2025. Revenue for Thom Browne was down 22.4% for the period to 129.5 million euros, per a separate release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nZegna Group acquired a majority stake in Thom Browne Inc. in 2018. At the time, the brand was valued at about $500 million, and Bazan, who was the brand\u2019s CEO, continued in the role.\n\n\u201cOver the past nine years, I have been working side by side with Rodrigo, and together we have developed Thom Browne from a niche brand into today\u2019s luxury icon of modern tailoring,\u201d Thom Browne, chief creative officer and founder of his namesake brand, said in the release. \u201cI am profoundly grateful for his unwavering support and dedication throughout this extraordinary journey.\u201d\n\nSince its acquisition, Thom Browne\u2019s revenue has nearly tripled, according to Zegna Group\u2019s Chairman and CEO Ermenegildo \u201cGildo\u201d Zegna.\n\n\u201cRodrigo\u2019s entrepreneurial vision, along with his pivotal role in Thom Browne\u2019s defense of its intellectual property rights against Adidas, has been instrumental in protecting and reinforcing the brand\u2019s authentic and unique identity,\u201d Zegna said in the release announcing Bazan\u2019s departure.\n\nHowever, the brand has been struggling for a while. Thom Browne revenue dropped 16.8% year over year to 315 million euros in fiscal 2024, and revenue declined 19% in the first quarter of 2025. The company attributed declines at the Thom Browne brand to a decision to reduce exposure in the wholesale channel, and in Q1, the brand posted a 48% year-over-year wholesale drop.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Zegna Group said in its release that revenue declines at Thom Browne continued to be \u201csignificantly affected by the performance of the wholesale channel, which more than offset the growth recorded in the DTC channel.\u201d\n\nThe company added that the brand has been streamlining its wholesale channel presence to focus on direct distribution.\n\n\u201cLeading Thom Browne over the past 9 years has been an extraordinary journey,\u201d said Bazan in the release, adding that while he had decided to \u201cstep down to focus on new opportunities,\u201d he would \u201calways remain connected and supportive of the brand\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lobban, prior to his time at Nordstrom, worked at Selfridges in London, and was part of Mr Porter\u2019s founding team, per the release. While at Nordstrom, he curated brand collaborations, which included work with Thom Browne.\n\nBrowne said in the release that Lobban\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of [the] brand\u2019s distinctive DNA and his visionary approach make him the ideal partner to help shape the future of our brand.\u201d\n\nZegna Group sold 14.1 million treasury shares to Temasek Holdings on Tuesday.

This announcement coincided with Ermenegildo Zegna Group reporting a 3% year-over-year revenue decline for the first half of fiscal 2025. During the same period, Thom Browne's revenue decreased by 22.4%. Additionally, Zegna Group sold 14.1 million treasury shares to Temasek Holdings, which now owns 10% of the group.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe leadership transition at Thom Browne occurs during a period of significant revenue decline for the brand. Despite the company's past growth where revenue nearly tripled since its 2018 acquisition, recent performance shows substantial drops. Thom Browne revenue declined 16.8% in fiscal 2024 and 19% in the first quarter of 2025, which challenges the perception of consistent, robust growth for the luxury brand. While the company attributes these declines to a strategic reduction in wholesale exposure, the severity of the drops, including a 48% wholesale decline in Q1, could challenge the effectiveness or speed of this transition strategy.\n\n**The big picture:**\nErmenegildo Zegna Group acquired a majority stake in Thom Browne Inc. in 2018, valuing the brand at approximately $500 million. Rodrigo Bazan, who led Thom Browne since 2016, continued as CEO after the acquisition. Since the acquisition, Thom Browne's revenue had nearly tripled, according to Zegna Group's Chairman and CEO.

Every region reported sales growth.\n\nMiu Miu also reported growth, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in the previous quarter . The brand posted a 40% year-over-year retail sales increase in Q2 and 49% overall growth for H1. Meanwhile, retail sales at the Prada brand fell 3.6% in Q2 and 1.9% in H1. Brand retail sales were posted in constant currency.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDeclining retail sales at Prada underpinned the announcement that the brand's CEO Gianfranco D\u2019Attis was exiting the company by mutual agreement, effective June 30. D\u2019Attis spent just over two years in the role, and Prada Group CEO Andrea Guerra will succeed him in an interim capacity until a permanent appointment is made.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s release, Guerra in part attributed Prada Group\u2019s solid second quarter performance and strong first half to the cultural relevance of the company\u2019s brands. He added that the Prada brand \u201cshowed resilience against increasingly subdued demand dynamics and high comps,\u201d while Miu Miu showed \u201csustainable growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain headwinds are likely to be more cyclical than structural, but it is essential to execute with focus,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cLooking ahead, while being vigilant and nimble, we remain committed to our strategy and to our ambition to deliver solid, sustainable and above-market growth.\u201d\n\nBy region, retail sales in Asia Pacific were solid throughout Q2 and increased 8% to 838 million euros for the first half of the year. In Europe, the company said second quarter sales were impacted by lower tourist spending and tough comps, offset by stable local demand, which led to an overall 7% sales increase to 728 million euros in H1.\n\nSales in the Americas rose 10% in the first half. Japan experienced a deceleration in the second quarter after posting an 18% year-over-year uptick in Q1, leading to a 6% increase in the first half to 326 million euros.\n\nSales in the Middle East grew 24% to 137 million euros in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cIn the first half of the year we delivered a sound set of results, testament to the strength of our brands and disciplined execution,\u201d Patrizio Bertelli, Prada Group\u2019s chairman and executive director, said in the release. \u201cThis healthy performance was achieved against a challenging backdrop, somewhat unprecedented in our industry.

This decline underpinned the departure of Prada brand CEO Gianfranco D\u2019Attis, effective June 30.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe decline in retail sales at the core Prada brand, leading to its CEO's exit, indicates internal strategic challenges despite overall group revenue growth. This performance contrasts with Miu Miu's strong growth, suggesting varied brand-level dynamics within the company.

Those changes followed the December 2024 hire of Louise Trotter as creative director at Bottega Veneta.\n\nIn 2024, Kering also appointed new CEOs at Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Gucci.\n\nThe company has also made changes on its operational and financial fronts, Pinault said in Tuesday\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cIn a particularly tough market environment, we continued to streamline our distribution and cost base, and, executing on our roadmap, we took decisive steps to strengthen our financial structure,\u201d Pinault said. \u201cThough the numbers we are reporting remain well below our potential, we are certain that our comprehensive efforts of the past two years have set healthy foundations for the next stages in Kering\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nKering quarterly revenue since Q1 2023 Chart represents year-over-year % changes and total revenue in dollars.\n\nHowever, the luxury company\u2019s leadership instability was concerning, said Yanmei Tang, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge.\n\n\u201cKering has changed designers across its three main brands simultaneously, a risky move given the group\u2019s reliance on figures like [Deputy CEO] Francesca Bellettini, who holds significant sway over appointments and brand direction,\u201d Tang said in emailed comments. \u201cThis top-heavy approach often leads to reactive, short-term decisions aimed at plugging immediate gaps, in contrast to LVMH\u2019s longer-term, structured leadership model.\u201d\n\nKering is also facing a tough reality in its two main luxury markets, China and the United States, Tang said.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s consumers have become cautious, preferring to save rather than spend on luxury, while the US market is wobbling under political unpredictability that is clouding consumer confidence,\u201d Tang said, adding that product desirability is now a bigger problem for Kering than any tariff threat.\n\n\u201cDesirable brands like Herm\u00e8s can nudge prices higher without hurting demand, but brands such as Saint Laurent and Gucci do not currently enjoy that level of pricing power,\u201d Tang said. \u201cOur experts point out that creative stagnation is not helping, with designers spending much of their time mining archives rather than bringing fresh ideas to the market.\u201d\n\nKering\u2019s second quarter retail sales were down 16% year over year, and down double digits in every region. In North America, retail sales fell 10%, while in Asia-Pacific they were down 19%. Meanwhile, in Western Europe sales sank 17%, and Japan retail sales fell an eyewatering 29%, which Kering attributed to a sharp decline in tourism.\n\nAt Yves Saint Laurent, first half revenue was down 11% to 1.3 billion euros. Revenue from the Kering\u2019s other houses, including jewelry brands and fashion houses Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, declined 15% to 1.5 billion euros for the same period. Bottega Veneta revenue rose 1% to 846 million euros for the period.\n\nBut the biggest problem for Kering is at Gucci, where losses continue to deepen following last year\u2019s steep revenue declines.\n\n\u201cTurning Gucci around will take time,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThe brand needs at least two to three collections to stabilise under new creative leadership, especially as any change in designer inevitably risks alienating existing clients while trying to cultivate a new audience.\u201d",

Net income plummeted 46% for the half. Gucci's first-half revenue sank 26%, and its recurring operating income nosedived 51%. Kering's second-quarter retail sales were down double digits across all regions.\n\n**Why it matters:** Kering's leadership instability, with simultaneous designer changes across three main brands, is concerning and risks alienating existing clients. This \"top-heavy approach\" may lead to reactive, short-term decisions, challenging expectations of strategic stability. The company faces a tough market in China and the U.S., compounded by product desirability issues and creative stagnation. Brands like Gucci lack pricing power, unlike competitors, further indicating a challenge to their market position.\n\n**The big picture:** Kering has experienced a turbulent year marked by significant leadership and creative team changes. New CEOs were appointed at Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and Gucci in 2024, alongside new creative directors at Balenciaga, Gucci, and Bottega Veneta. CEO Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault noted the company streamlined distribution and costs while strengthening its financial structure amid a tough market. He believes two years of efforts have laid healthy foundations, despite current results being below potential.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Kering's first-half fiscal 2025 revenue declined 16% to 7.6 billion euros.\n* Net income plummeted 46% to 474 million euros for the first half.\n* Gucci first-half revenue sank 26% to 3 billion euros.\n* Kering's second-quarter retail sales were down double digits in every region.\n* Bottega Veneta revenue rose 1% to 846 million euros for the period.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Kering:** Luxury company reporting significant revenue declines and extensive leadership changes.\n*   **Gucci:** Kering's largest brand, facing deep losses and described as Kering's \"biggest problem.\"\n*   **Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault:** Kering's current CEO, acknowledging tough market; will be succeeded.\n*   **Yanmei Tang:** Third Bridge analyst, critical of Kering's leadership instability and market strategy.\n*   **Third Bridge:** Research firm, whose analyst Yanmei Tang commented on Kering's challenges.\n*   **Demna Gvasalia:** Became new artistic director of Gucci in March after departing Balenciaga.\n*   **Pierpaolo Piccioli:** Named new creative director at Balenciaga in May.\n*   **Francesca Bellettini:** Deputy CEO, noted for significant sway over appointments and brand direction.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A board vote in September will determine the new Kering CEO.\n*   Turning Gucci around will require at least two to three new collections under new creative leadership.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Kering's deep revenue declines signal a challenging turnaround amidst leadership upheaval.",

The limited-edition offering, sold at retailers nationwide throughout the back-to-school season, reportedly has savory notes of garlic and classic Italian spices.\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Kraft Heinz is giving consumers in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit \u2014 three of the most iconic pizza places in the U.S. \u2014 the opportunity to get the macaroni and cheese flavor delivered to their doorstep in as little as 15 minutes in a custom Kraft Mac & Cheese pizza delivery box.\n\n\u201cPizza is such an iconic food, and we wanted to create something totally out of the (blue) box to introduce the world to our newest limited-edition flavor,\u201d Cheryl Barbee, communications director for Kraft Mac & Cheese at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement. \u201cFrom the scented delivery box to the rapid delivery timing, red pepper flakes, and even our note to the fans which we designed to look like a \u2018guest check,\u2019 we really lean into the sensorial elements of the pizza delivery experience.\u201d\n\nThe $2.9 billion shelf-stable macaroni and cheese market is ripe for meaningful growth, with a near-term opportunity topping $100 million, Nestl\u00e9 said in 2024.

The other teas will arrive at nationwide retailers later this summer.\n\nMore consumers are relying on beverages to support their health, using a variety of drinks to support hydration, energy or mood.

Hain Celestial expanded its Celestial Seasonings wellness tea portfolio with new functional beverages for all-day support, including Good Vibes Lemon Mint and Detox Blend Dandelion. General Mills' Progresso brand introduced a new Pitmaster line of BBQ-inspired soups featuring meat, roasted vegetables, and high protein content. These new offerings expand each company's product lines with novel flavors or functional benefits.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article highlights major CPG companies responding to evolving consumer preferences for novel flavors, health-supporting beverages, and convenient, budget-friendly meal solutions. Kraft Heinz's strategy of launching limited-time flavors shows an effort to maintain engagement in the significant mac and cheese market. Hain Celestial's move into all-day wellness aligns with surging demand for functional non-alcoholic drinks, which outpaced alcohol sales growth. General Mills' soup innovations capitalize on increased at-home eating due to budget tightening, a trend seen at levels not witnessed since early 2020. This collective pivot towards customization, functional benefits, and at-home consumption could challenge a view that established CPG brands are slow to adapt or face stagnant growth in mature categories.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe shelf-stable macaroni and cheese market is a significant segment, with one estimate indicating a near-term growth opportunity of over $100 million. Consumers are increasingly seeking beverages that support their health, leading to demand for functional drinks.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nA brewing storm of climate change and tariffs has sent coffee prices soaring and accelerated interest in bean-free alternatives.\n\nDroughts in Vietnam and Brazil have decimated coffee crops, sending prices up to an all-time high earlier this year. Producers are now bracing for the prospect of even higher costs if new tariffs from the Trump administration go into effect next month on top coffee producing countries.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper and J.M. Smucker, which owns Folgers and Cafe Bustelo, have both raised prices as costs continue to escalate. Since last October, Smucker has raised coffee prices at least three times, with plans to hike them a fourth time this August, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nFor food tech companies and startups working on coffee alternatives, escalating prices could position bean-free substitutes as a cheaper, more sustainable option.\n\n\u201cThis can only happen now; 10, 20 years ago \u2026 there weren't those supply chain shocks,\u201d said Jake Berber, cofounder of Prefer, a Singapore-based startup that turns food waste into bean-free, ground coffee. \u201cToday, for the first time, we can create this product that is more affordable and more sustainable than coffee using modern, cutting edge fermentation technologies.\u201d\n\nPrefer, founded in 2022, makes its bean-free coffee from food byproducts, including soy pulp and broken rice. Berber said it uses ingredients that are \"not pretty enough to go in packaging,\" but contain the qualities and starches needed to create its coffee alternative through the company's fermentation process.\n\nLast February, Prefer raised $2 million in a seed round led by Forge Ventures to fund a manufacturing facility. The company's bean-free coffee is now available at several dozen outlets in Singapore, and is on track to reach 100 locations by the end of the year.\n\nStill, the bean-free alternative isn't a complete replacement and is meant to be used in addition to typical coffee. In order to achieve the same beloved flavor of a morning pour, only up to 40% of Prefer's substitute can be mixed in.\n\nBut those looking for a caffeine fix shouldn\u2019t worry. Prefer is able to make a wide range of caffeinated products, from decaffeinated to double caffeinated.\n\n\u201cCaffeine is just an ingredient for us to be easily sourced from things like green tea, for example,\u201d Berber said, adding that he plans to expand Prefer\u2019s products into other flavors threatened by climate change such as cacao, vanilla, and citrus.\n\nWith more than 2 billion cups consumed daily, coffee is already the world\u2019s most traded agricultural commodity and climate change is expected to push up prices in the long term. Half of the world's coffee farmland could be erased by 2050, and at least 60% of wild coffee species \u2014 including the beloved arabica \u2014 are at risk of going extinct in the wild due to deforestation and disease.\n\nWhile dwindling supply is spurring momentum for coffee alternatives, researchers in the industry say they believe the beloved beverage can be here to stay for a long time, with the right innovation and investment.\n\nWorld Coffee Research is working with coffee growers around the world to breed high quality varieties of coffee that are disease-resistant and productive \u2014 even in the face of often dire climate predictions. In 2024, the group secured a $10 million investment from its global member companies for agricultural R&D to enhance productivity, reduce environmental footprint, and sustain choice for consumers.\n\nHanna Neuschwander, senior advisor of communications at World Coffee Research, said researchers \u201care very optimistic that coffee that comes from a tree will continue to be a viable and important livelihood for many millions of people.\"\n\n\u201cYou have these alternatives arising to solve a problem, but there are many ways to solve a problem,\u201d she added.",

Producers anticipate even higher costs if new tariffs from the Trump administration target top coffee-producing countries next month. Major companies like Keurig Dr Pepper and J.M. Smucker, owner of Folgers and Cafe Bustelo, have already raised prices in response. Smucker has implemented at least three price hikes since last October, with a fourth planned for August.\n\n**Why it matters:** Escalating traditional coffee prices position bean-free alternatives as a potentially cheaper and more sustainable option for consumers and businesses. This trend challenges the long-held consensus that traditional coffee sourcing alone can meet global demand affordably and sustainably. The article suggests that severe supply chain shocks, now occurring, create a viability for these alternatives that did not exist previously. This shift could prompt investors to consider the emerging market for coffee substitutes as a hedge against volatility in the traditional commodity market.\n\n**The big picture:** Coffee is the world's most traded agricultural commodity, with over 2 billion cups consumed daily. Climate change is projected to significantly impact coffee production, potentially eliminating half of the world's coffee farmland by 2050. Furthermore, at least 60% of wild coffee species, including arabica, face extinction due to deforestation and disease. While these challenges spur interest in alternatives, groups like World Coffee Research are also investing in R&D to develop disease-resistant coffee varieties, aiming to sustain tree-grown coffee for the long term.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Coffee prices reached an all-time high earlier this year.\n*   J.M. Smucker has raised coffee prices at least three times since last October, with a fourth planned for August.\n*   Prefer, a bean-free coffee startup, raised $2 million in a seed round last February.\n*   Prefer's substitute can be mixed in up to 40% to achieve beloved coffee flavor.\n*   World Coffee Research secured a $10 million investment in 2024 for agricultural R&D.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Trump administration:** Potentially imposing new tariffs on top coffee producing countries next month.\n*   **Keurig Dr Pepper:** Major beverage company that has raised its coffee product prices due to escalating costs.\n*   **J.M.

According to Numerator, 34% of beverage shoppers plan to drink more tap water and 26% more bottled or canned water in the coming year.

According to Numerator, 85% of the top 20 growing brands fall into these active lifestyle categories.\n\nWithin soft drinks, the low or no sugar flavored soda category in particular has seen significant growth and expansive choices, with brands like Poppi and Health-Ade's SunSip leading the charge.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStarry is offering its lemon-lime soda on the house when the weather turns scorching this summer as part of its efforts to shore up a positioning around refreshment, according to a press release from the PepsiCo-owned brand.\n\nU.S. consumers can visit a website to add a digital pass to their mobile wallets as part of the \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\" campaign. Once temperatures surpass 100 degrees in their region, the pass triggers automatically, and they can upload a receipt for a 20-ounce Starry purchase to receive 100% cash back via PayPal or Venmo.\n\nThrough July 31, Starry is also deploying out-of-home (OOH) ads and vending machines that dispense Starry around the same temperature threshold in three markets: Miami, Charlotte and Atlanta. The campaign\u2019s concept echoes one from Starry\u2019s chief rival as more beverage brands factor extreme weather into their marketing.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nStarry is promoting itself as a free way to cool down once temperatures tip into the triple digits in the dog days of summer. That could occur more frequently as the effects of climate change produce a greater quantity of longer-lasting heat waves. Many U.S. consumers have already faced a punishing season so far in 2025, and Starry sees its product as a way to deliver \u201cintense refreshment\u201d to soft drink fans who are sweating it out. \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d runs through Sept. 2, while supplies last, and the deal is limited to one offer per customer.\n\nThe brand, which PepsiCo launched two years ago to replace Sierra Mist, joins others in the beverage category in recognizing that intense weather, while alarming, provides opportunities to experiment with contextual and regionally targeted marketing. The OOH component and vending machine activations included in \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d are largely oriented around the South, including Atlanta, where Starry\u2019s biggest competitor, Sprite, is based.\n\n\u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d bears similarities to a global campaign that Coca-Cola-owned Sprite debuted in May. \u201cTurn Up Refreshment\u201d features dynamic OOH ad placements that assess factors like location and ambient temperature to serve messages to consumers when temperatures climb to intolerable levels. That effort is focused on international markets, such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Brazil.\n\nFor PepsiCo, the promise of a free Starry could be a way to build awareness and affinity for the two-year-old brand. In addition, Starry is enlisting both national and local influencers to spread the word about the promotion on social channels.\n\nThe campaign arrives as market share for PepsiCo\u2019s flagship soda continues to decline. Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soft drink in the U.S. by volume earlier this year, according to Beverage Digest data. Pepsi last year lost its long-held spot as No. 2 to Dr Pepper.\n\nPepsiCo marketing leadership has seen a shakeup in recent months as well. Mark Kirkham was named CMO of U.S. beverages in April following the departure of Greg Lyons, who held the role since 2018. The beverages division in June also expanded its work with agency VaynerMedia, with the aim of becoming more \u201cculturally fluent\u201d and activating around fast-moving social conversations. Starry is among the five brands in focus for the integrated team.",

Chobani's product also allegedly copied Danone's \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan, the suit said.\n\nDanone is requesting a judge to issue an injunction against Chobani to prevent the company from using the slogan.

Danone unsuccessfully sued three years later over Chobani's claims that its kids' drinkable yogurt had 33% less sugar.\n\nIn the latest lawsuit, Danone said Chobani's improper use of its intellectual property was \"knowing, calculated, and systematic.\" Danone chose the \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan in January 2021 as a way to distinguish itself from Starbucks and La Colombe, which was an independent company at the time.\n\nAfter Chobani bought La Colombe for $900 million in 2023, Danone claimed it started using a \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan on its coffee packaging. It also changed the product from \"medium roast\" to \"light roast,\" matching Danone's offering, the suit claims.\n\nDanone said Chobani has taken other steps to copy its packaging. Chobani's high-protein Greek yogurt, for example, allegedly uses similar colors, fonts and graphics to Danone's Oikos brand.\n\n\"Chobani's actions enable and have already enabled Chobani to free ride on Danone's reputation,\" Danone said in the suit.\n\nChobani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs food giants combat declining sales, more companies have taken steps to preserve profits by protecting their brand equity.

That's provided more opportunities for the Pennsylvania company to bring the popular flavors into other textures.\n\nHershey devoted more attention to innovating Jolly Rancher starting in 2020 when it relaunched Gummies with new shapes, flavors and packs.\n\nLast year, Hershey launched Jolly Rancher Ropes, which included a chewy outer layer and a soft, fruit-flavored filling. Each rope featured two flavors: green apple and watermelon, or blue raspberry and cherry. And in 2025, Hershey launched Jolly Rancher Freeze Dried, providing consumers with a more poppable offering with a unique, airy texture.\n\nThe wave of innovation has reduced Jolly Rancher\u2019s dependence on its iconic hard candy. While the segment is still growing \u2014 with sales up more than $50 million since the end of 2020 \u2014 less than half of the brand's sales today come from hard candy, down from about 80% a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of permission [from the consumer] with Jolly Rancher to do things in different forms, but maintain our flavors,\u201d Dark said.\n\nDark said Jolly Rancher\u2019s ability to play across multiple sweets categories is \u201cboth freeing and challenging,\" allowing the brand to quickly enter a hot new trend or roll out a seasonal offering. At the same time, it forces executives to \u201cexercise a little bit of restraint because every possible form is available to you,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, Jolly Rancher\u2019s innovation strategy is paying off. Ranked No. 11 among non-chocolate sweets just three years ago, the brand has climbed to the No. 5 spot today, according to Hershey.\n\nAs demand surges, Hershey is holding off on expanding the Jolly Rancher brand into new categories to focus on growing its existing offerings. Ropes have \u201ca long runway ahead of them,\u201d Dark said, while Hershey can \u201cbarely keep up with the demand\u201d for Freeze-Dried.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough to keep us busy,\u201d Dark confessed.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Hershey's Jolly Rancher sales surge from category innovation.\n\n**Key details:**\nJolly Rancher sales reached $400 million in 2024, representing a 25% increase from the prior year. This growth is driven by expanding the 76-year-old brand into new categories like gummies, ropes, and freeze-dried candy. Less than half of Jolly Rancher's sales now come from its iconic hard candy, a significant reduction from approximately 80% a decade ago. The brand has climbed from the No. 11 spot to No. 5 among non-chocolate sweets in just three years.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis innovation strategy has successfully diversified Jolly Rancher's revenue streams, significantly reducing its dependence on its traditional hard candy. It demonstrates that a long-standing brand can successfully adapt to changing consumer preferences and achieve substantial growth. This might challenge a view that established brands, particularly those known for a specific product form, struggle to innovate and significantly shift their sales mix to capture new market share. The brand's climb in ranking confirms the effectiveness of this strategic pivot.\n\n**The big picture:**\nJolly Rancher is a 76-year-old brand, part of snacking giant Hershey, known for its bold fruit flavors. Hershey began focusing more attention on innovating the Jolly Rancher brand starting in 2020. The strategy aimed to leverage the brand's popular flavors by bringing them into other candy textures and categories. This focus has reduced the brand's reliance on its iconic hard candy segment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$400 million:** Jolly Rancher sales in 2024.\n*   **25%:** Sales increase from the prior year.\n*   **Less than half:** Current percentage of Jolly Rancher sales from hard candy.\n*   **80%:** Percentage of Jolly Rancher sales from hard candy a decade ago.\n*   **No. 5:** Jolly Rancher's current ranking among non-chocolate sweets.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Hershey:** The snacking giant that has seen Jolly Rancher sales soar due to its innovation strategy.\n*   **Jolly Rancher:** The 76-year-old candy brand experiencing significant sales growth from new product categories.\n*   **Allen Dark:** Director of Hershey\u2019s sweets portfolio, who discussed Jolly Rancher's successful innovation approach.\n*   **Reese's:** A brand Hershey is best known for, mentioned as part of the snacking giant's portfolio.\n*   **Hershey\u2019s Kisses:** Another brand Hershey is best known for, mentioned as part of the snacking giant's portfolio.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nJolly Rancher's multi-category innovation is fueling strong growth and diversification for Hershey.",

The company still expects to deliver 5% to 6% organic revenue growth this year.\n\nMarketing campaigns were cited by executives as contributing to the growth of different brands, including original Coca-Cola, Coca\u2011Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke.\n\nThe beverage maker is navigating a volatile global economy and recently announced plans to use U.S. cane sugar in its signature beverage, a change first announced by President Donald Trump.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Q2 earnings, which beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, demonstrate how the CPG giant is driving growth despite facing different challenges around the globe. The company\u2019s organic growth rate is in line with its guidance for the full year even as volumes soften.\n\n\u201c[While] the external environment continues to be dynamic, and there is no doubt that much uncertainty remains in the downhill, we remain growth-orientated,\u201d said CEO James Quincey on a call discussing the results with investors. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to pivot our plans as needed, and we are harnessing our all-weather strategy to deliver on our growth ambitions.\u201d\n\nPart of that \u201call-weather strategy\u201d rests on marketing, which executives cited as bolstering a number of brands during the quarter. The company used contextually relevant advertising to push messages of value and affordability in Q2, and saw volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke, Fanta, Fairlife, Bodyarmor and Powerade.\n\nA relaunch of the \u201cShare a Coke\u201d campaign was activated on more than 10 billion bottles and cans in more than 120 countries and included over 30,000 names tailored to local markets. The effort contributed to single-serve transaction growth in the category and helped Coca-Cola Zero Sugar see double-digit volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, Diet Coke\u2019s \u201cThis is My Taste\u201d campaign, which was inspired by social media insights, contributed to the product\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth in North America.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s marketing was also a source of productivity-related savings that improved the company\u2019s margins. The marketing transformation that the company has undertaken for the last few years is finding not just effectiveness via digital and segmented advertising, but also efficiencies in advertising production and media buying, Quincey explained.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to need to make investments in different areas of the company to drive future sales, but they also like to get productivity enhancements to offset some of those investments so\u2026 they can grow the top line and improve margins,\u201d said Dave Novosel, senior bond analyst Gimme Credit. \u201cThe fact that they've been able to do both is encouraging\u2026 The advertising productivity is a big part of that.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s marketing transformation has also helped the company quickly test ideas, share learnings and scale campaigns across its portfolio. To that point, the company saw consumer perception improve significantly in Mexico as it launched initiatives like its \u201cJuntos Posen\u201d campaign and an activation around the World Cup. The use of targeted, contextual advertising also helped Coca-Cola push back on claims about how its product is made that have dogged the company in several markets and demographics.\n\nThe company also made official plans to expand its flagship product with an offering made with U.S. cane sugar as a way to offer consumers more choices. The plan was first announced last week by President Trump.\n\n\u201cAs you may have seen last week, we appreciate the President\u2019s enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand,\u201d Quincey said on the earnings call.",

Yet, at many retailers, such inefficiencies forfeit more inventory than the smash-and-grab robberies that go viral or make the news.\n\nOrganized retail crime continues to hold the attention of policymakers and retail industry groups. But some loss prevention experts say the impact of external theft on inventory loss or shrink is overstated, while the causes of nearly two-thirds of shrink are going largely unappreciated and, therefore, unaddressed.\n\nInventory loss is out of the spotlight to a great extent, in part because many, if not most, retailers that had been complaining about shrink levels have reported improvements. After about 30 years, the National Retail Federation last year said it would no longer report on shrink trends in the industry.\n\nStill, laxity related to labor, pricing, promotions, stock management and other store operations leads to shrink and costs retailers billions, according to a recent study from Coresight Research. The percentage of gross sales lost to in-store inefficiencies stands at 5.5% on average, up from 4.5% last year. Overcoming those inefficiencies could save U.S. retailers in the home improvement, drugstore, grocery, mass merchant and warehouse club sectors as much as $162.7 billion, up 27% since last year, per Coresight.\n\nTackling this requires a hard look at store operations and, for most retailers, a more holistic approach to loss prevention, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I was a bad-guy catcher. I wanted to catch bad guys, I was good at catching bad guys. I loved the adrenaline, I loved the cat and mouse. That\u2019s all I wanted to do,\u201d Johnny Custer, senior director of retail risk solutions at ThinkLP, told sister-publication Retail Dive. \u201cI\u2019ve evolved from that. There are some very progressive retailers where the relationship between operations and LP is seamless, where loss prevention is a specialized extension of the operations team. That\u2019s ultimately where we all need to be. But they are few and far between.\u201d\n\nMargin protection\n\nThat evolution requires retailers to view their loss prevention teams as not just crime fighters but as protectors of profits and margin more broadly.\n\n\u201cLoss prevention is perceived as a cost center. A necessary cost center, a part of doing business,\u201d Custer said by video conference. \u201cMy goal is to change that perspective so that people understand that we're not a cost center, we can actually be a profit driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I was a bad-guy catcher. I wanted to catch bad guys, I was good at catching bad guys. ... I\u2019ve evolved from that.\" Johnny Custer Senior director of retail risk solutions, ThinkLP\n\nErrors in merchandising, pricing and other functions add up quickly, according to Brad Bogolea, CEO and co-founder at Simbe Robotics, which sponsored Coresight\u2019s research.\n\nMore than 80% of the 394 retail business decision-makers that Coresight surveyed said they\u2019re losing at least 5% of their operating margin to in-store inefficiencies; last year just 70% reported that. This year, mistakes related to promotions have been the biggest challenge, with nearly 40% ranking it in their top five, while nearly that many cited pricing errors. Losses from out-of-stocks also stood out, with 57% reporting the issue.\n\n\u201cEven small lapses \u2014 a product on the wrong shelf, an incorrect label \u2014 can cascade into major losses,\u201d Bogolea said. \u201cThese issues erode margins and create friction for shoppers. In contrast, retailers that solve for visibility are seeing a step-change in performance across supply chain, e-commerce fulfillment and store operations.\u201d\n\nUnpacking where margins are being squeezed by operational failures requires data, something Custer learned when he was working in loss prevention for someone who was a data analyst.\n\n\u201cHe expanded my mind and asked me to look into point-of-sale. And then, not only point-of-sale, but center of store, all of the sales-floor data, then the back of the store \u2014 all the inbound, outbound flow data,\u201d he said. \u201cTo look for similar patterns of behavior that occur within each, because loss can happen anywhere in the building. I did it reluctantly, but I became a believer the moment the financial results came out.\u201d\n\nTech to the rescue\n\nGetting that data \u2014 and the visibility into store operations that it provides \u2014 is enabled by technologies that find mistakes, flag needs and detect patterns.\n\nRetailers are increasingly turning to them. In the U.S., retailers\u2019 plans for investment in store intelligence technologies for the next year have skyrocketed over 150%, Coresight found. More than a third of retailers say they\u2019ll be investing at least $500,000 in that time; on average, each company is dedicating more than $415,000.\n\nSome 60% of retailers have turned to AI to assist in loss prevention, with another 30% planning to do so in the next year, according to a February study from vision AI firm Everseen.\n\n\u201cEven small lapses \u2014 a product on the wrong shelf, an incorrect label \u2014 can cascade into major losses.\" Brad Bogolea CEO and co-founder, Simbe Robotics\n\nTech is helping break down the divisions between the loss prevention and operating teams, according to loss prevention consultant Brand Elverston, who works with major retailers and brands.\n\n\u201cThe silos of risk mitigation, store operations and supply chain are all but going, and that's been fueled largely by countless use cases of technologies that are out in the space today,\u201d he said. \u201cI can do your in-stock. I can tell you if it came in off the truck. I can tell you how many people are in the store. I can tell you, if somebody stole something, what door they went out of.\u201d\n\nSome tech designed to detect crime or criminal intent has gained broader uses, as at Verensics, an employee questionnaire-based platform. Some retailer clients are now sharing information gleaned from employee questionnaires so that teams in store ops, human resources, loss prevention and elsewhere can connect various dots, according to Verensics CEO-founder Russ Law. Similarly, ThinkLP platforms leverage point-of-sales data, human resources data, inventory data and more.\n\n\u201cThe data is geared towards crime, obviously, but it's being used more and more for operational integrity issues,\u201d Verensics\u2019 Law said by video conference. \u201cMaybe the inventory isn't being done right because nobody knows exactly what they're supposed to be doing. Or maybe there's a manager who's not getting the point across the way they're supposed to. It\u2019s identifying places where there are training opportunities, or where there are opportunities to tighten up processes, as well as identifying bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe human touch\n\nAs much as technology has revolutionized store operations, though, retailers risk undermining their systems if stores are inadequately staffed.\n\nStore-level thefts, always a problem in retail, got a boost around the time of the Great Recession. ThinkLP\u2019s Custer attributes that to job cuts, especially around 2008 or so, that went too far and haven\u2019t been restored in the years since.\n\n\u201cThe worse the backroom looks, the higher the shrink. It's just the way it is. If you're not managing inventory, you've increased your risk of shrink.\u201d Brand Elverston Loss prevention specialist, Elverston Consulting\n\n\u201cRetailers cut a lot of non-essential personnel, and one of the first groups of people they cut were the perpetual inventory, day-to-day count keepers, the folks that scan the store and keep count,\u201d Custer said. \u201cThat has had a ripple effect across so many profitability areas \u2014 from clearance markdowns to in-stock position to day-to-day customer service. I can point to that one mistake and say that if that wouldn\u2019t have happened, we\u2019d be in a much different situation right now.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, retailers eliminated many of the non-essential employees who weren\u2019t coming into work, and shrink ballooned, according to Elverston.\n\n\u201cThe worse the backroom looks, the higher the shrink. It's just the way it is,\u201d he said by video conference. \u201cIf you\u2019re not managing inventory, you\u2019ve increased your risk of shrink.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Retailers Losing Billions to Internal Errors, Not Just External Theft\n\n**Key details:** A recent Coresight Research study reveals in-store inefficiencies cause 5.5% of gross sales loss for retailers, up from 4.5% last year. Overcoming these could save U.S. retailers $162.7 billion, a 27% increase since last year. Over 80% of retail decision-makers surveyed report losing at least 5% of their operating margin to these issues. Mistakes in promotions and pricing, along with out-of-stocks, are cited as major challenges.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information challenges the current focus on external theft, particularly organized retail crime, as the primary driver of retail shrink. Loss prevention experts argue the impact of external theft is overstated, with nearly two-thirds of shrink stemming from unaddressed in-store inefficiencies. While many retailers reported improvements in shrink levels, the data indicates substantial, unaddressed operational losses. Viewing loss prevention as a profit driver, not just a cost center, could yield significant savings.\n\n**The big picture:** While organized retail crime holds attention, understaffing and operational inefficiencies are causing significant unaddressed inventory loss for retailers. The National Retail Federation ceased reporting on industry shrink trends last year, indicating less focus on the issue. Loss prevention teams are evolving from solely crime fighting to protecting profits and margins more broadly. Historical job cuts, especially since 2008 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, are attributed to current shrink issues due to inadequate staffing for inventory management.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   5.5%: Average gross sales lost to in-store inefficiencies (up from 4.5% last year).\n*   $162.7 billion: Potential savings for U.S. retailers from addressing these inefficiencies.\n*   More than 80%: Retail decision-makers losing at least 5% of operating margin to inefficiencies.\n*   Over 150%: Increase in retailers' planned investment in store intelligence technologies.\n*   60%: Retailers currently using AI for loss prevention.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Coresight Research: Published a study revealing billions in retail losses from in-store inefficiencies.\n*   ThinkLP: Retail risk solutions firm whose senior director discussed evolving loss prevention roles.\n*   Johnny Custer: Senior director at ThinkLP, advocates for viewing loss prevention as a profit driver.\n*   Simbe Robotics: Sponsored Coresight's research; its CEO highlighted margin erosion from operational errors.\n*   Brad Bogolea: CEO/co-founder of Simbe Robotics, noted small lapses cascade into major losses.\n*   National Retail Federation: No longer reports on industry shrink trends, removing focus from the issue.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for increased retailer investment in store intelligence technologies over the next year.\n*   Anticipate more retailers implementing AI for loss prevention, with 30% planning to do so.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Retailers face billions in overlooked losses from internal inefficiencies, not just external theft.",

Flashfood \u201cfits squarely in that\u2026 [as] we answer both sides of the equation,\u201d Schenck said.\n\nKroger stated in its 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance report that it aims to have \u201c100% of [its] retail stores actively donating surplus fresh food by 2025.\u201d The grocery company plans to divert 95% of the more than 166,000 tons of food waste it expects to generate this year. By comparison, the company diverted just under 52% of the more than 265,000 tons of food waste it generated in 2023.\n\nAs the Kroger pilot expands, the grocer will receive more updated technology from Flashfood, including its new partner app. The app, which launched in beta last week, includes updated analytics and more dynamic pricing opportunities for its retail partners with AI-driven and predictive insights, according to Schenck. The updated app will roll out across Flashfood\u2019s operations later this year, she said.\n\nRichmond is a \u201cnet-new area and region for Flashfood,\u201d Schenck said.\n\nKroger marks the first major partnership Flashfood has announced since Schenck stepped into the CEO role in early May. She is the first woman to helm the technology company. Flashfood has established partnerships with a number of grocers, including Meijer, Family Fare, Loblaw, Tops Friendly Markets and Giant Eagle.\n\nThe Kroger partnership \u201cdoes signal where we\u2019ve grown as a business in a much more meaningful way,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIt does help really bolster where we are heading as we grow up as a company and then also grow up as a company in tech in grocery.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Friday Checkout is a weekly column providing more insight on the news, rounding up the announcements you may have missed and sharing what\u2019s to come.\n\nDistribution has been a hot-button issue for the grocery industry this year, with United Natural Foods, Inc.\u2019s cybersecurity attack taking center stage along with C&S Wholesale Grocers\u2019 recent bid to acquire SpartanNash.\n\nWith all eyes on the food supply chain, grocers\u2019 efforts to build out self-distribution networks couldn\u2019t be more timely.\n\nSelf-distribution was a major talking point during Sprouts Farmers Market\u2019s second quarter earnings call earlier this week. Though UNFI\u2019s near shutdown was \u201cminimally disruptive\u201d to the fast-growing specialty grocer, according to CEO Jack Sinclair, its expanding self-distribution network is looking more and more appealing these days. It will enable the specialty grocer to have \u201cmore control over [its] supply chain while minimizing operations and supply chain risks,\u201d Sinclair told investors.\n\nSprouts runs a network of distribution centers across its operating footprint, with around 80% of its stores located within 250 miles of one. The grocer has a new DC set to open in Northern California next year. It\u2019s also bringing its fresh meat and seafood sourcing in-house, according to an April investor presentation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a transition period,\u201d Sinclair said about the ongoing efforts to establish a more self-sufficient supply chain. He added that Sprouts will continue to take over distribution of \u201ckey product categories.\u201d\n\nSprouts is far from the first food retailer to turn to self-distribution. Ahold Delhaize US, for example, has ADUSA Distribution as well as ADUSA Transportation to serve all of its stateside banners. This self-distribution push began in 2019 and, as of 2023, included around two dozen facilities along the East Coast.\n\nWalmart is also part of this trend. This year alone, the retailer opened its first owned-and-operated case-ready beef facility, purchased a distribution center in Utah and debuted a Sam\u2019s Club distribution center in Florida.\n\nSelf-distribution is difficult to carry out for smaller, independent grocers that lack the resources to build and operate supply facilities. But for larger retailers, it can help save money and avoid catastrophe if third-party distributors can\u2019t deliver.\n\nThe outside of an Ahold Delhaize USA distribution center in Chester, New York.

The page provides individual food definitions for states that have received waivers as well as state communication strategies, implementation timelines and a state-by-state comparison showing how \u201ccandy\u201d is defined. The trade group said it will keep the resource updated as information becomes available.\n\nDoorDash bolsters its grocery presence\n\nThe e-commerce provider announced Tuesday the addition of six retailers to its platform. The newcomers include Bi-Rite Market and Lunardi\u2019s Markets in the San Francisco Bay Area, Superior Grocers in California and three grocers in Ohio: Dave\u2019s Markets, Dorothy Lane Market and Lucky\u2019s Markets.\n\nWhole Foods takes on \u201cbiodiversity highway initiative\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Whole Foods Market unveiled a partnership with Mad Agriculture to launch a national initiative aimed at reconstructing native ecosystems across farmland in the U.S. The program, which will begin in and around the Lowery Creek Watershed in Wisconsin, aims to buffer communities from flooding and erosion, improve soil and water health, and support pollinators and wildlife.\n\nWhole Foods said the creation of a 1,000-acre \u201cbiodiversity highway\u201d will address issues such as disappearing biodiversity, declining soil health and weakening ability of land to withstand environmental stress. As part of the initiative, the Amazon-owned grocer has pledged up to $500,000 in matching funds to \u201ccatalyze $1 million in collective investment from food system stakeholders in 2025.\u201d\n\nImpulse find\n\nStop & Shop makes a \u2018Happy\u2019 cameo\n\nNetflix\u2019s hit movie \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u201d features a laundry list of star cameos, including Ben Stiller, rapper Eminem, NFL player Travis Kelce and pro golfers Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s our personal favorite: Stop & Shop.\n\nThe Northeast grocery chain\u2019s Clifton, New Jersey, store plays a key role early on in the film.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Grocers Build Self-Distribution Networks for Supply Chain Control and Resilience\n\n**Key details:**\nSprouts Farmers Market is expanding its self-distribution network to gain more supply chain control and minimize risks. The grocer will open a new distribution center in Northern California next year and is bringing fresh meat and seafood sourcing in-house. Other large retailers, including Ahold Delhaize US and Walmart, are also adopting self-distribution strategies. This approach is challenging for smaller grocers but can save money and avoid issues for larger retailers if third-party distributors fail.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis trend matters as it shows large grocers are actively reducing reliance on third-party distributors, a potential shift from the current model. For investors, this could signal greater resilience against supply chain disruptions, like the recent UNFI cyberattack, which was only \"minimally disruptive\" to Sprouts due to existing efforts. The move aims to minimize operational and supply chain risks while potentially saving money. This challenges a view where external distribution is seen as the sole efficient model, highlighting grocers' proactive steps to control their destiny.\n\n**The big picture:**\nDistribution has become a critical issue for the grocery industry this year, driven by events such as United Natural Foods, Inc.\u2019s cybersecurity attack. The broader food supply chain is under scrutiny, prompting grocers to seek more robust solutions. Self-distribution, while challenging for smaller players, is being embraced by larger retailers to mitigate risks and gain control. This strategic shift has been ongoing, with examples like Ahold Delhaize US starting its push in 2019 and Walmart also expanding its owned operations.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Around 80% of Sprouts Farmers Market stores are within 250 miles of one of its distribution centers.\n* Ahold Delhaize US's self-distribution push includes around two dozen facilities along the East Coast as of 2023.\n* Whole Foods Market pledged up to $500,000 in matching funds to catalyze $1 million in investment by 2025.\n* Whole Foods' initiative aims to create a 1,000-acre \"biodiversity highway.\"\n* \"Happy Gilmore 2\" garnered 46.7 million views in its first three days on Netflix.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI): Experienced a cybersecurity attack, highlighting grocery distribution challenges.\n* C&S Wholesale Grocers: Initiated a bid to acquire SpartanNash amidst distribution discussions.\n* SpartanNash: Target of an acquisition bid by C&S Wholesale Grocers.\n* Sprouts Farmers Market: Specialty grocer expanding its self-distribution network for improved control.\n* Jack Sinclair: Sprouts Farmers Market CEO, emphasizing self-distribution benefits for investors.\n* Ahold Delhaize US: Large retailer that started its extensive self-distribution network expansion in 2019.\n* Walmart: Major retailer actively expanding its owned-and-operated distribution facilities this year.\n* FMI \u2013 The Food Industry Association: Developed a new resource for members regarding state SNAP policies.\n* DoorDash: E-commerce provider that added six new grocery retailers to its platform recently.\n* Bi-Rite Market: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Lunardi\u2019s Markets: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Superior Grocers: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Dave\u2019s Markets: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Dorothy Lane Market: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Lucky\u2019s Markets: One of six new retailers added to the DoorDash grocery platform.\n* Whole Foods Market: Partnered on a national initiative to reconstruct native ecosystems on farmland.\n* Mad Agriculture: Collaborated with Whole Foods Market on a national biodiversity highway initiative.\n* Stop & Shop: Grocery chain that gained brand awareness through a cameo in \"Happy Gilmore 2.\"\n* Netflix: Platform that released \"Happy Gilmore 2,\" showcasing Stop & Shop's brand.\n* Adam Sandler: Actor playing Happy Gilmore, shown working at Stop & Shop in the film.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* Sprouts Farmers Market is set to open a new distribution center in Northern California next year.\n* Whole Foods Market aims to catalyze $1 million in collective investment from stakeholders by 2025.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMajor grocers are internalizing distribution to gain control and mitigate supply chain risks.",

Similar to recent years, Sprouts aims to open 35 new locations by the end of this year \u2014 a goal it is on track to achieve, according to Sinclair. During Q2, the specialty grocer opened a dozen new locations.\n\nIn addition to store growth in 2025, Sprouts is also readying a larger expansion effort in the coming years. Currently, the grocer has more than 130 approved locations in the pipeline \u2014 up from nearly 120 last quarter \u2014 mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nTo better support its growing footprint, Sprouts is continuing to invest in self-distribution, which Sinclair said is a \u201cstrategic priority, enabling scalable growth in the future.\u201d This work has included expanding supply chain capacity in existing markets as well as building new capacity in Sprouts\u2019 expansion markets. Sprouts aims to place stores within 250 miles of a distribution center, Sinclair said.\n\nThe company is also working to take over distribution of \u201ckey product categories,\u201d specifically meat and seafood. Sinclair said that Sprouts will begin in-sourcing fresh meat and seafood this quarter in Orlando, Florida, and continue the work through the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. In the next three to five years, Sprouts will also focus on new distribution center expansion, he said.\n\nSprouts is also growing its private label assortment, with the grocer planning to release over 350 new products in 2025. Sprouts\u2019 store brand contributed to 24% of total sales in Q2, the grocer\u2019s CFO Curtis Valentine said during the investor call.\n\nSprouts sees slight dip in comp sales after six consecutive quarters of growth Sprouts\u2019 quarterly comparative store sales growth.\n\nFor its second quarter, Sprouts reported a net sales year-over-year increase of 17%, totaling $2.2 billion, and a 10.2% increase in comparable-store sales. While these results still signify growth across nearly all aspects of Sprouts\u2019 operations, the grocer\u2019s same-store sales growth dipped slightly from the 11.7% growth it posted in the metric in Q1, marking its first quarterly dip in more than a year.",

Walmart said at the time it would appeal that verdict, but this week\u2019s settlement rules out that option.\n\nJudge James M. Moody of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas said in a Monday filing that he had been notified that the two sides reached a settlement. Walmart stated to Arkansas Business that it and Zest Labs \u201cagreed to a confidential settlement that resolves all issues between them.\u201d\n\nZest sued Walmart in 2018, claiming Walmart had stolen its cold-chain management technology that extends produce shelf life. The tech company said it showed the technology to Walmart executives in 2014 and entered into a confidential agreement a few months later. Walmart eventually released a solution called Eden that Zest said closely resembled its invention.\n\nIn 2021, a jury awarded Zest $115 million, but in 2023, Judge Moody granted a new trial at Walmart\u2019s request after learning that Zest withheld relevant evidence.

While at the pet supply company, he led its distribution and transportation strategy across North America and oversaw an international distribution network.\n\nOldham brings more than 25 years of experience in retail, CPGs and consulting to Kroger, including leadership roles at Petco, Walmart, Ernst & Young and Walgreens.\n\n\u201cEd brings a wealth of knowledge from his time working at and supporting a variety of different retailers,\u201d Ron Sargent, chairman and interim CEO of Kroger, said in a statement. \u201cSourcing plays a critical role in making sure we can provide lower prices to our customers every day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Reed will bring \u201cdeep experience across our organization\u201d to her upcoming role overseeing the grocer\u2019s private brands portfolio, Sargent said. Reed started at Kroger as a co-manager in the Central Division in 1993 and worked her way up the company, holding positions such as store manager, category manager, director of deli and bakery, and director of Fresh Ready Meals, according to the announcement.\n\nReed became vice president of merchandising at Fry\u2019s in 2010, followed by VP of merchandising at Fred Meyer in 2013 and then VP of Customer 1st Promise in 2015. Reed became Louisville division president in 2017 and has helmed the Cincinnati-Dayton division since 2022.\n\n\u201c[Reed] worked in divisions throughout the country getting to know how our customers want to shop and what they want to buy,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cAnn is bringing a great perspective on the ways we can better take advantage of the significant growth opportunities Our Brands represents for Kroger.\"\n\nLike Reed, Cannon and Harpole also climbed the Kroger corporate ladder.

That comes on top of providers\u2019 hefty burden of administrative work and other tasks in electronic health records, which clinicians say requires them to work overtime and contributes to burnout.\n\nTo help automate some of this work, the HTI-4 rule adds and updates criteria for software to receive certification by regulators. The Health IT Certification Program is a voluntary program that outlines standards and functionality for health IT, like EHRs.\n\nOn prior authorization, the regulation adopts three new criteria: one that allows providers to request information from payers about coverage requirements, another that offers a method for clinicians and other EHR users to quickly collect the data needed for a prior authorization request, and a third that allows providers to submit requests through their IT systems and check the request\u2019s status.\n\nThe final prior authorization criteria are a little different than originally proposed, said Alex Baker, deputy director of the alignment and engagement division of the office of policy at ASTP.\n\nThe proposed regulation, first announced last year, had only included one criterion that included all of the capabilities. But regulators broke them into three to provide more flexibility, allowing IT companies to certify products based on just one functionality instead, he said.\n\nHTI-4 also adds new criteria for functionality for application programming interfaces, or APIs, linked to the prior authorization standard, including allowing workflow triggers in an EHR for clinical decision support tools. Another criteria allows users to be notified by a server of an event, like an update on a prior authorization request.\n\nOutside of prior authorization, the rule adopts a new criterion for real-time prescription benefit information, so providers and patients can easily compare drug prices, see out-of-pocket costs and check prior authorization requirements.\n\nAdditionally, HTI-4 updates criteria for electronic prescribing, which enables prescription data to be shared between providers, pharmacies and payers.\n\nThe rule is part of a series of interoperability regulations released over the past couple years. HTI-4 includes some provisions from the HTI-2 proposed rule, which was first released in July last year.\n\nOther parts of the initial HTI-2 proposal were finalized in other regulations, including one published in December that focused on the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, or TEFCA, and another on an information blocking exception that aimed to preserve access to reproductive healthcare.\n\nThe HTI-1 regulation, finalized in December 2023, is a sweeping rule that included transparency requirements for artificial intelligence in certified health software.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe CMS on Thursday finalized a 2.6% payment increase for inpatient hospitals in 2026, higher than what regulators originally proposed earlier this year.\n\nHospital payments will now rise by about $5 billion in 2026 \u2014 $1 billion more than what was originally proposed under a 2.4% payment increase in April.\n\nMedicare also finalized changes to quality reporting, including removing COVID-19 vaccination requirements for healthcare workers and a mandatory payment model starting in January.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe inpatient pay raise reflects a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment, according to a CMS fact sheet on the final rule.\n\nThe rule also includes higher payments to disproportionate share hospitals for uncompensated care in Medicare. Disproportionate share hospitals will now receive approximately $2 billion more in uncompensated care payments, higher than the $1.5 billion increase originally proposed.\n\nHospital groups said they appreciated the pay bump, but still considered it inadequate. Hospitals have raised concerns about their pay alongside rising inflation and looming healthcare policies finalized in the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d that will cut funds to hospitals and raise the uninsured rate.\n\n\u201cThe AHA is also pleased that CMS\u2019 payment updates and support for hospitals that treat a disproportionately high number of low-income patients are improved in this final rule,\u201d said Ashley Thompson, senior vice president of public policy analysis and development at the American Hospital Association, in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are still concerned that these updates are not adequate enough for the many hospitals that are struggling in today\u2019s challenging operating environment, especially those in rural and underserved communities.\u201d\n\nOther finalized changes include the removal of some measures included in inpatient quality reporting requirements. Hospitals report certain quality metrics as a condition of their inpatient payment rate from Medicare, and those that don\u2019t report quality data or don\u2019t meet all program requirements can have their annual inpatient payments reduced by 25%.\n\nNext year, hospitals won\u2019t be required to report metrics on COVID vaccination among healthcare workers, a health equity metric and some screenings related to social determinants of health. The Trump administration has targeted mandatory COVID vaccination policies, including those in public schools and the federal agency that reviews the vaccines.\n\nThe CMS is also tweaking a mandatory payment model debuting next year, called Transforming Episode Accountability Model. The five-year alternative payment model aims to hold hospitals accountable for care quality for patients undergoing surgeries in traditional Medicare. In TEAM, select acute care hospitals in certain geographic areas will assume responsibility for the cost and quality of care from surgery through the 30 days after the Medicare enrollee leaves the hospital.\n\nThe final rule includes minor changes to TEAM, including broadening certain waivers for skilled nursing facilities and using patient-reported outcomes in outpatient settings.\n\nHospitals have pushed back on the mandatory payment model, which they say could burden low-resource hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe AHA has long supported widespread adoption of meaningful, value-based and alternative payment models to deliver high-quality care at lower costs. We remain worried that the Transforming Episode Accountability Model (TEAM) will not advance these objectives and puts at particular risk hospitals that are not of a large enough size or in a position to support the investments needed,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is why we continue to urge the agency to make TEAM voluntary.\u201d\n\nThe CMS also said it will discontinue a low wage index hospital policy for 2026 and all subsequent years, after an appellate court found the CMS lacked statutory authority to adopt the policy. The low wage index policy, first adopted in the CMS\u2019 final rule for 2020, proposed to temporarily adjust reimbursement rates according to a wage index that would compare regional average wages to national averages. The policy, which was meant to last four years, was aimed to mitigate growing wage disparities between hospitals, but a D.C. circuit court overruled the policy in July 2024.\n\nIn addition to discontinuing the policy, the rule also finalized a \u201cnarrow,\u201d budget-neutral transitional payment exception to the calculation of 2026 inpatient rates for hospitals significantly impacted by the discontinuation.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Cigna Tops Q2 Estimates Driven by Strong Evernorth Growth\n\n**Key details:** Cigna surpassed investor expectations for second-quarter earnings and revenue, primarily fueled by robust growth in its Evernorth health services arm. Evernorth reported $57.8 billion in revenue, a 17% increase year-over-year, with adjusted income from operations rising 5% to $1.7 billion. While Cigna\u2019s health insurance segment faced \"persistently elevated medical costs,\" it performed within expectations. This unit's adjusted revenue of $10.8 billion was down 18% year-over-year, largely due to the divestiture of its Medicare business.\n\n**Why it matters:** Many insurers have struggled with heightened medical costs in the second quarter, particularly those exposed to Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid plans. Cigna's results suggest it is more insulated from these challenges due to its focus on employer-sponsored health plans. The company's COO stated Cigna has \"no exposure to Medicaid or Medicare\" following a recent sale. This strategic positioning might challenge the current consensus that all health insurers are equally vulnerable to rising medical costs across all market segments.\n\n**The big picture:** The broader insurance industry has faced significant pressure from rising medical costs in recent quarters, particularly affecting companies with substantial exposure to government-sponsored health plans. Cigna proactively repositioned its Cigna Healthcare portfolio, including divesting its Medicare business, to navigate this challenging environment. Additionally, Cigna's pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, operates amidst increased scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers regarding drug costs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Overall Q2 Revenue: $67.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year.\n*   Evernorth Q2 Revenue: $57.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year.\n*   Cigna Healthcare Q2 Adjusted Revenue: $10.8 billion, down 18% year-over-year.\n*   Medical Loss Ratio (MLR): 83.2% in Q2, up from 82.3% in 2024.\n*   Adjusted income from operations outlook reaffirmed: at least $29.60 per share.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Cigna:** Exceeded Q2 earnings and revenue expectations, driven by its health services arm.\n*   **Evernorth:** Cigna\u2019s health services arm, which reported strong revenue and income growth in Q2.\n*   **Health Care Service Corporation:** Acquired Cigna\u2019s Medicare business earlier this spring.\n*   **Brian Evanko:** Cigna COO, noted health insurance segment performing within expectations despite higher medical costs.\n*   **Ann Dennison:** Cigna CFO, attributed manageable pressure in ACA plans to disciplined pricing actions.\n*   **Express Scripts:** Cigna\u2019s large pharmacy benefit manager, facing increased scrutiny from regulators.\n*   **David Cordani:** Cigna CEO, expressed satisfaction with a federal judge's decision on an Arkansas PBM law.\n*   **Arkansas:** State that passed a law attempting to force PBMs to divest pharmacies, later put on hold.\n*   **Federal judge:** Issued a decision earlier this week to put Arkansas's PBM law on hold.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Cigna anticipates the PBM industry will continue to operate in an active legislative and regulatory environment.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Cigna's strategic focus helped it navigate rising costs, delivering strong Q2 results.",

The pilot is a significant departure from the traditional 340B model, which gives hospitals upfront discounts for certain medications. Under the pilot, hospitals would receive rebates coordinated by drug manufacturers, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. To receive reimbursement, providers will submit data to manufacturers within 45 calendar days of dispensing the drug, allowing for some extenuating circumstances, and then receive a rebate within 10 days.\n\nrebates coordinated by drug manufacturers, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. To receive reimbursement, providers will submit data to manufacturers within 45 calendar days of dispensing the drug, allowing for some extenuating circumstances, and then receive a rebate within 10 days. The American Hospital Association immediately criticized the program on Thursday, warning diverting from the decades-old 340B program sets a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for the future.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe 340B Drug Pricing Program was created more than three decades ago to support hospitals with a large number of low-income patients by requiring drugmakers to offer those providers steep discounts on outpatient drugs \u2014 often about 20% to 50% off the list price of a drug. Since its conception, the program has grown greatly to over 55,000 covered entities in 2021.\n\nThe program has proved a flash point between drugmakers and providers, as pharmaceutical companies say the rebates, which cover billions of dollars worth of drugs each year, cut into their bottom lines. Some also argue hospitals are cheating the program.\n\nDrugmakers say hospitals have diverted drugs to ineligible patients or, in some cases, received duplicative discounts for the same medications. Hospitals, however, say the 340B rebates are a needed lifeline for hospitals with low operating margins.\n\nResearch is mixed about the efficacy of the program. Some studies have found the program works as intended, allowing hospitals to expand services for low-income patients and subsidize uncompensated care. However, other studies find hospitals are not complying with basic tenets of 340B, including not reselling discounted medications.\n\nDrugmakers have been pushing for a 340B rebate model to tamp down on what they say is waste, fraud and abuse in the program. Last year, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis sued the federal government to allow them to issue rebates for 340B drugs instead of upfront discounts.\n\nHowever, a court shut down those plans earlier this year, ruling that HRSA would have to sign off on such a rebate plan. While the Biden administration sought to uphold the traditional 340B model, the Trump administration has signaled an interest in adding additional oversight to the program, including potentially putting CMS in charge of overseeing rebates.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is introducing a pilot program that, in a limited capacity, offers a chance to test a rebate system.\n\nThe pilot, which will be limited to the 10 drug products included on the CMS Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Selected Drug List, is accepting applications from drug manufacturers until Sept. 15, with a start date of Jan. 1.\n\nThe program aims to address \u201cconcerns we have received from both covered entities and manufacturers, while creating a measured approach to the process of approving manufacturer rebate models under the 340B Program,\u201d said HRSA Administrator Tom Engels in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe look forward to receiving comments and working with everyone to ensure that the program operates with accountability, transparency and adherence to the 340B statute, allowing covered entities to stretch scarce resources as far as possible.\u201d\n\nHospital groups immediately reacted negatively to the pilot.\n\n340B Health, an association of more than 1,600 hospitals, said that shifting to a post-purchase model would force some hospitals to pay an average of more than $72 million upfront, potentially straining their ability to provide patient care service. The group said in a statement Thursday that it worried about the administrative and financial cost of the program \u2014 particularly if the Trump administration chooses to expand the pilot beyond the initial 10 drugs.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that this guidance authorizes a significant departure from how the 340B program has successfully operated for decades and sets a dangerous precedent for possible harmful expansions in the future,\u201d said Aimee Kuhlman, vice president of advocacy grassroots and government relations at the American Hospital Association, echoing 340B Health\u2019s sentiments.\n\nHowever, the AHA said it appreciated HRSA\u2019s efforts to \u201cimpose strict guardrails on its limited pilot program.\u201d\n\nFor example, manufacturers will be in charge of handling all IT costs related to submitting drug purchasing data. The notice also requires \u201cno additional administrative costs of running the rebate model shall be passed onto the covered entities.\u201d\n\nIn addition, HRSA mandates manufacturers cannot deny a rebate based on concerns of diversion or duplicate discounts.",

This spring, the telehealth firm acquired UpLift, another virtual mental health company, which already worked with payers like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Cigna.\n\nAnd in late June, Teladoc began a \u201csoft launch\u201d of BetterHelp insurance in one state, which would lay the groundwork for expansion over the next several quarters, CEO Chuck Divita said on the earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to build that network out beyond the single state, so that as we ramp further, we\u2019ll be able to turn on multiple markets over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do want to take it methodically here at the start to make sure all the capabilities that we build are working.\u201d\n\nThe move to accept insurance shows progress on Teladoc\u2019s strategic changes, but \u201cthe full impact of these repositioning efforts is going to take some time to play out, and comes against a more challenging macro backdrop,\u201d Cherny wrote.\n\nIn Teladoc\u2019s integrated care unit, which includes business-to-business virtual care offerings, revenue revenue rose 4% to $391.5 million in the second quarter, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 10% to $57.5 million.\n\nThe unit\u2019s overall membership increased 11% compared with the previous year to 102.4 million members. However, enrollment in chronic care management programs fell 5% due to a contract loss, Murthy said.\n\nTeladoc also narrowed its revenue and earnings outlook for 2025.

Major payers like Elevance, Molina and UnitedHealth have cut their earnings guidance as they face high medical costs, particularly in Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and Medicare plans.\n\nHeightened medical expenses also hit CVS hard last year, as seniors in Medicare Advantage sought out more care and Medicaid beneficiaries remaining in the program after redeterminations were sicker and required more services.\n\nAdditionally, this spring CVS announced plans to exit the ACA marketplace entirely for 2026, after CEO David Joyner said the company saw no \u201cnear- or long-term pathway\u201d for Aetna to improve its performance on the exchanges.\n\nBut the company\u2019s health benefits unit began to turn around last quarter \u2014 and the improved performance has held in the second quarter, according to results released Thursday.\n\nCVS recorded $36.3 billion in revenue in its health benefits unit, increasing nearly 12% from the $32.5 billion reported in 2024.\n\nAdjusted operating income rose to $1.3 billion due to favorable risk adjustment changes in the exchanges, as well as improved performance in government insurance programs, CVS said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to report that we are making meaningful progress in the Aetna business. Our recovery has been a top priority,\u201d Joyner said on the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the results of these efforts delivering better experiences while also allowing us to better navigate this elevated utilization environment.\u201d\n\nStill, the company recorded a premium deficiency reserve \u2014 how much an insurer expects they might need if premiums collected aren\u2019t sufficient to meet future claims expenses \u2014 of $471 million in the second quarter, linked to high costs in CVS\u2019 group MA plans.\n\nGroup MA plans are multi-year agreements, so CVS can update prices on them less frequently, CFO Brian Newman said. However, about half of CVS\u2019 group MA plans are set to be repriced next year, he added.\n\nOverall, the health benefits segment recorded a medical loss ratio, a marker of spending on patient care, of 89.9%, up slightly from 89.6% last year.\n\nIn CVS\u2019 health services unit, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark as well as its healthcare delivery assets, revenue increased about 10% to $46.5 billion.\n\nBut adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, down nearly 18% year over year, in part due to a high medical loss ratio at the company\u2019s value-based primary care chain Oak Street Health.\n\n\u201cWe saw some pressure inside of our healthcare delivery business that was driven by persistent elevated medical cost, the member mix that we had and then the more robust benefit and supplemental benefit offerings that plans provided to their members,\u201d said Prem Shah, group president at CVS, whose oversight includes its care delivery business.\n\nHowever, the medical cost pressure at Oak Street and the company\u2019s premium deficiency reserve weren\u2019t a complete surprise, \u201cgiven results from others across the managed care complex,\u201d Michael Cherny, an analyst at Leerink Partners, wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nOverall, CVS beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and revenue in the second quarter.

CVS's improved performance in its health benefits unit challenges the industry-wide trend of rising medical expenses that impacted other payers. This indicates CVS is \"making meaningful progress\" in its Aetna business recovery.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe second quarter proved challenging for many insurers, with high medical costs impacting Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Medicare plans. Heightened medical expenses also hit CVS hard last year, particularly with seniors in Medicare Advantage and sicker Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, CVS announced plans to exit the ACA marketplace entirely for 2026 due to lack of a \"near- or long-term pathway\" for improvement. Despite these broad industry challenges and its own past struggles, CVS's health benefits unit began a turnaround last quarter.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **New adjusted EPS outlook:** $6.30 to $6.40 (up from $6.00-$6.20).\n*   **Health benefits segment adjusted operating income Q2:** Rose more than 39% year over year.\n*   **Health benefits unit revenue:** $36.3 billion (up nearly 12% from $32.5 billion reported in 2024).\n*   **Overall Q2 revenue:** $98.9 billion (more than 8% year over year increase).\n*   **Premium deficiency reserve:** $471 million, linked to high costs in group MA plans.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CVS Health:** Healthcare giant that raised its adjusted earnings outlook.\n*   **Aetna:** CVS's insurance unit, improved performance contributed to the raised outlook.\n*   **Caremark:** CVS's pharmacy benefit manager, included in the health services unit.\n*   **Oak Street Health:** CVS's primary care chain, facing elevated medical cost pressure.\n*   **Steve Nelson:** Aetna president, encouraged by quarter's play out on earnings call.\n*   **David Joyner:** CVS CEO, pleased with Aetna business recovery progress.\n*   **Brian Newman:** CVS CFO, discussed repricing of group Medicare Advantage plans next year.\n*   **Prem Shah:** CVS group president, discussed medical cost pressure in care delivery business.\n*   **Michael Cherny:** Leerink Partners analyst, noted medical costs weren't surprising given other results.\n*   **Elevance:** Major payer that cut earnings guidance due to high medical costs.\n*   **Molina:** Major payer that cut earnings guidance due to high medical costs.\n*   **UnitedHealth:** Major payer that cut earnings guidance due to high medical costs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   About half of CVS\u2019 group MA plans are set to be repriced next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCVS Health defies industry trends with stronger insurance unit, raises outlook.",

The partnership aims to \u201cdeliver results for the American people\u201d in the first quarter next year, the CMS said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nInteroperability and information sharing is a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector, made harder by siloed data that doesn\u2019t easily flow between providers and a reliance on dated technology like fax machines.\n\nStill, the industry has seen some recent progress on health data sharing. In late 2023, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, a governance framework for information exchange, went live after years of effort.\n\nTEFCA launched with five Qualified Health Information Networks, or QHINs, and their number has since expanded to nine, including new additions like e-prescribing Surescripts\u2019 data exchange and ambulatory electronic health record vendor eClinicalWorks.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is launching its own data sharing initiative. It includes the CMS Interoperability Framework, which the agency said is a \u201ccall to action for health data networks that want to move faster.\u201d\n\nThe framework\u2019s criteria are supposed to be \u201cvisionary,\u201d the CMS said. Some of the goals include ensuring patients can access their electronic medical data anywhere on the network, using apps of their choice.\n\nPatients should also be able to access claims, explanation of benefits and prior authorizations from current and past payers, and data queries should be responded to quickly \u2014 possibly in real time, according to the CMS.\n\n\u201cFor too long, patients in this country have been burdened with a healthcare system that has not kept pace with the disruptive innovations that have transformed nearly every other sector of our economy,\u201d CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. \u201cWith the commitments made by these entrepreneurial companies today, we stand ready for a paradigm shift in the U.S. healthcare system for the benefit of patients and providers.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one companies have pledged to become CMS Aligned Networks, including EHR and health IT vendors like Epic, Oracle Health and athenahealth, as well as data exchanges that have received QHIN status like CommonWell Health Alliance and eClinicalWorks.\n\nThe CMS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by press time on how the latest data sharing initiative will interact with TEFCA.\n\nAdditionally, eleven health systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Bon Secours Mercy Health and Intermountain Health, said they would participate in the networks. They pledged to accept patient information through digital tools to help \u201ckill the clipboard\u201d \u2014 or stop requiring patients to fill out medical histories on paper before visits.\n\nThirty companies, like Google, Apple and Samsung, joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology, according to the CMS.\n\nThat includes a pledge to allow patients to retrieve their health data through the network or personal apps, and then share that information with providers. Other firms signed on to use the network or apps to access health data to provide support to patients managing diabetes or obesity.",

The direct subsidy for 2026 will be $200.28, rising from $142.67 this year, according to TD Cowen analysts.\n\nThe Medicare Part D bids come as healthcare costs continue to rise, driven by increasing pharmacy expenses for medications like pricey GLP-1s.\n\nIn a fact sheet on the bid data published Monday, the CMS said it took \u201cunprecedented action\u201d to hold insurers accountable for premium increases, including by negotiating bid terms and conditions, and denying bids that included significant increases in cost sharing or a decrease in benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the CMS announced it would make some changes to the Part D Premium Stabilization Demonstration, which was first put in place in 2025 to keep premiums steady and give more predictable options to enrollees.\n\nThe demonstration initially included a uniform reduction of $15 to the base beneficiary premium, a year-over-year increase limit of $35 on a plan\u2019s total Part D premium and narrowed risk corridors.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe pharmacy benefit manager marketplace is dominated by a handful of large players, many of which are vertically consolidated with health insurers, according to a new paper from a top medical association.\n\nOn average, local PBM markets are highly concentrated across services like rebate negotiation, retail network management and claims adjudication, according to the study from the American Medical Association. And nationally, 77% of people in prescription drug plans are covered by an insurer that\u2019s vertically integrated with a PBM.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s paper is the latest in a number of studies finding a lack of competition in the PBM landscape, which experts say could be harming consumers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPBMs, which manage prescription drug benefits for the majority of Americans, were created decades ago to help insurers contain drug spending. But scrutiny of the drug middlemen has been ramping up amid concerns they may not be passing savings through to clients and that their negotiations with drugmakers could be inflating pharmaceutical prices, among other concerns.\n\nThe current situation can be traced back to a lack of competition in the PBM landscape, experts say. Just three companies \u2014 Optum Rx, Caremark and Express Scripts \u2014 jointly control 80% of the U.S. prescription drug market, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nCritics, including antitrust regulators, allege that those \u201cBig Three\u201d are leveraging their size to profit from their middleman role in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s new paper used 2022 and 2023 data from Medicare and commercial prescription drug plans and the FTC\u2019s measure of market concentration to determine competition in PBM markets. It found on average high levels of concentration and vertical consolidation, when the same company owns both an insurer and a PBM.\n\nConcentration levels were similar across PBM functions that plans and employers generally contract out: rebate negotiation, retail network management and claims adjudication, according to the paper.\n\nFor example, the study found that in 2023 Optum Rx, which is owned by UnitedHealth, was the largest PBM in the U.S. when it came to rebate negotiation, with 22.2% of the market. Optum Rx was followed by CVS\u2019 Caremark, which held an 18.9% share, and Express Scripts, which held a 15.5% share.\n\nPrime Therapeutics, a PBM that\u2019s jointly owned by a number of Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers, rounded out the top four, with 10.6% of the rebate negotiation market.\n\nHowever, more recent estimates of market concentration say Express Scripts holds a larger share of the market, after the PBM won a massive Centene contract that went into effect last year. The AMA said that next year\u2019s edition of the study, which will be based on data from 2024, should rank Express Scripts as the second largest or largest PBM nationally.\n\nOf the 10 largest PBMs in the rebate negotiation market, nine share ownership with health insurers, the AMA study found.\n\nMedImpact is the only PBM that wasn\u2019t affiliated with a health insurer \u2014 though, the company sells a standalone prescription drug plan, so technically all 10 are vertically integrated, the AMA said.\n\n\u201cThese are important findings because low competition may lead to higher prices paid by insurers for PBM services, higher insurance premiums, PBMs not fully passing rebates through, and lower reimbursement to pharmacies,\u201d the AMA\u2019s paper reads. \u201cMoreover, given extensive vertical integration of insurers and PBMs, non-affiliated insurers may be losing access to PBMs.\u201d\n\nThe AMA\u2019s paper is the latest call for antitrust regulators and lawmakers to give PBM consolidation more scrutiny. A number of state attorneys general, independent pharmacy groups and other experts have all asked Congress to consider breaking up leading PBMs.\n\nThe FTC is currently suing Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx for allegedly driving up the cost of insulin, after publishing a pair of damning reports about their business practices. Congress has also shown an interest in reforming PBMs, with House and Senate committees holding numerous hearings in the past three years.\n\nLawmakers have introduced dozens of bills referencing the drug middlemen, running the gamut from forcing PBMs to disclose more information on their business practices to decoupling PBM compensation from the prices of drugs.\n\nConcrete legislation hasn\u2019t made it across the finish line, though some Washington watchers expect legislators to work to pass PBM reform in appropriations legislation closer to the end of 2025. Still, that\u2019s left a gap that states are stepping into: All 50 states have enacted laws targeting PBMs in an effort to lower prescription drug pricing, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.\n\nThe 186 pieces of state laws include those forbidding PBMs from stopping pharmacies from telling patients about cheaper drug alternatives or charging pharmacies extra fees, prohibiting PBMs from spread pricing and requiring PBMs to share more information about rebates and fees with the state.",

Meanwhile, the number of projects in the early planning stage (2,897) was up 13% year over year at the quarter\u2019s end.\n\nUpper-tier segments, extended stay dominate\n\nUpper-tier chain scales dominated the U.S. hotel pipeline in the second quarter, per Lodging Econometrics. Upper midscale had the highest project count (2,282) of all chain scales in its pipeline.\n\nThe upscale segment had the second largest pipeline in Q2, totaling 1,427 projects, or 177,756 rooms. Together, the upscale and upper midscale segments comprised 59% of all projects in the total pipeline in the quarter, the report detailed.\n\nLodging Econometrics also noted that the upper upscale project pipeline experienced notable growth in Q2, increasing 11% year over year to 360 projects. Upper-tier categories had a leg up over other chain scales in the first quarter this year as well.\n\nMeanwhile, extended stay brands continued to remain popular with developers, accounting for 38% of the projects under construction, 43% of those scheduled to begin within the next 12 months and 37% of projects in the early planning stage, according to Lodging Econometrics.\n\nThe total extended stay pipeline stood at 2,473 projects, representing 39% of the total pipeline and increasing 3% year over year.\n\nEarlier this year, Choice Hotels International CEO Patrick Pacious said extended stay and upscale limited service are the two segments with the highest developer and guest demand.\n\nHotel markets to watch\n\nDallas had the largest hotel construction pipeline of any U.S. market at the close of the second quarter, with 199 projects and a record 24,497 rooms, according to Lodging Economics.

However, this was a sequential decline from Q1 2025. Upper-tier chain scales, including upper midscale and upscale, dominated the pipeline, comprising 59% of all projects. Extended stay brands continued to be popular, accounting for 39% of the total pipeline and showing a 3% year-over-year increase. Dallas recorded the largest market pipeline with 199 projects.\n\n**Why it matters:** The overall year-over-year growth in the U.S. hotel construction pipeline signals continued expansion in the lodging sector. The strong focus on upper-tier and extended stay properties indicates where developers see the most demand and potential for future returns. This might challenge a consensus view of uniform growth or decline across the entire hotel market, instead highlighting a targeted investment shift. While the total pipeline saw a sequential dip from Q1, the significant rise in early planning projects suggests sustained long-term development interest.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nHotel Tech-in is our regular feature that takes a closer look at emerging technology in the hospitality industry.\n\nViewing renderings and taking virtual walk-throughs of hotel event spaces have been a go-to way for event planners to source venues for years. But the COVID-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on their importance, as in-person tours were temporarily halted.\n\nSince that time, innovation in the space has accelerated, with virtual event maps becoming more complex, customizable and detailed. More recently, they\u2019ve gone 3D.\n\n\u201cWe've heard from our planner sourcing reports that floor plans and diagrams and 3D virtual tours are increasingly important,\u201d Janine Alsalam, vice president of sales, Hospitality Cloud at Cvent, told Hotel Dive. \u201cThey're among the top elements that are helping them make their decisions for which venues to source.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to evolve its event map offerings, Cvent acquired Prismm, a platform that offers 3D layouts of venues, in April. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Following the deal, Cvent has been integrating Prismm\u2019s technology into its event-mapping platform, accelerating the push to 3D diagramming.\n\n\u201cWe've been doing a lot of learning about the best and greatest of both [Cvent\u2019s and Prismm\u2019s] platforms, and our vision is to bring those together into a combined solution that really meets the market need,\u201d Alsalam said.\n\nHotel Dive spoke to Alsalam about why the company was drawn to Prismm\u2019s offerings, next steps for the technology\u2019s integration and the future of event mapping hotel venues.\n\nEvent mappers join forces\n\nPrismm, which was founded in 2014 under the name Allseated, first launched its 3D layout tool in 2018, updating it later with augmented- and virtual-reality capabilities.\n\nAlsalam said 3D visualization is the biggest change to occur in the event-mapping space in years.\n\n\u201c3D in general has taken flight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was already developing in terms [of becoming a] better technology [with] more expectations for it, but then the pandemic accelerated that quite a bit.\u201d\n\nPrismm creates its virtual walk-throughs by sending a team of photographers to a venue to capture it using Matterport 3D cameras. The resulting maps not only show the venues as they are, but also allow users such as event planners to insert 3D models of objects into the floor plan, which Alsalam said is useful for event design as well as for \u201ccreating a visual showcase of your sample layouts for [a hotel\u2019s] sales and marketing team.\u201d\n\nCvent had already been working behind the scenes to improve its own event-mapping technology, which also included virtual walk-throughs of floor plans, Alsalam shared, but the company targeted Prismm for an acquisition because \u201cwe had two different ways to accomplish a similar goal, which is helping planners and venues visualize the space.\u201d\n\nPost-combination, Cvent and Prismm have more than 12,000 customers of their diagramming tool globally, Alsalam said, adding that venues that display virtual tours on Cvent\u2019s networks get approximately 2.5% more leads than those that don\u2019t.\n\nSupplementing, not replacing\n\nAlsalam said 3D mapping is supplementing in-person site visits \u2014 not replacing them. According to Alsalam, event planners say having instant access to a 3D model is helpful throughout the planning process and not just when they\u2019re selecting a hotel partner.\n\nAt the same time, virtual models can reduce an event\u2019s environmental impact if fewer people are needed to travel to a site. \u201cMany companies are trying to lower their carbon footprint and avoid site visits for smaller meetings,\u201d Alsalam noted.\n\nWith Prismm under Cvent's umbrella, there are further ways to integrate the companies' products. Alsalam said Cvent is considering flexible pricing that allows for a higher-priced premium offering and a less expensive version.\n\nCvent also plans on integrating Prismm\u2019s collaborative features, which give everyone from venue operators to planners and catering teams access to adjust floor plans.\n\n\u201cFrom a venue side, you want to make sure that you're giving those planners the tools to really design an event that you're going to be able to execute on-site,\u201d Alsalam said. \u201cA lot of times, the planner is owning the design. In other cases, it\u2019s the venue that's owning the design.\n\n\u201cWe're leaning really heavily into that collaborative nature of the product,\u201d Alsalam said.",

This strategic move aims to accelerate the push towards advanced 3D diagramming capabilities.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn 2023, Hilton announced plans to open an 800-room luxury Signia hotel \u2014 the brand\u2019s second ground-up build ever \u2014 in downtown Indianapolis. When it opens next year, the hotel will be a game-changer for the Midwestern Indiana city.\n\n\u201cWe'll be the tallest hotel in Indianapolis,\u201d Signia by Hilton Indianapolis General Manager Kathy Heneghan told Hotel Dive. \u201cEveryone is pretty amazed at how it's changing the view of the skyline in Indianapolis.\u201d\n\nBut the new hotel \u2014 which connects to the city\u2019s Indiana Convention Center by skywalk \u2014 will impact more than the skyline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the classic tide that raises all ships,\u201d Leonard Hoops, president and CEO of destination management organization Visit Indy, told Hotel Dive. When the Signia hotel opens, Hoops said, Indianapolis will be able to host more citywide conventions, putting Indianapolis\u2019 events market on par with major cities like Chicago.\n\nWhile Signia is the largest hotel under construction in Indianapolis, it\u2019s part of a broader wave of hotel development in the city, which is attracting larger and higher-end projects as demand for business travel and large-scale events rises, experts shared.\n\nHotel Dive spoke with city hospitality and tourism professionals about what\u2019s driving the development surge, which cities Indianapolis competes with and how the destination plans to add more inbound leisure travelers into the mix.\n\nConvention demand\n\nIndianapolis, which has a metro-area population of approximately 2.1 million, \u201cis just exploding,\u201d said Heneghan.\n\nMuch of that explosion is due to convention demand, which led to 932,000 hotel room nights booked in 2024, according to Visit Indy.\n\nOf Indianapolis\u2019 top 10 days for hotel demand ever, nine were in 2024, thanks in part to events like the solar eclipse and Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. Out of all U.S. markets in the path of totality, Indianapolis saw the greatest year-over-year RevPAR increase (up 660%) from the eclipse, according to STR.\n\nIn its initial announcement of the Signia, Hilton called Indianapolis \u201cone of the United States\u2019 highly acclaimed convention cities.\u201d\n\nAdding the Signia hotel and its 90,000 square feet of meeting space \u2014 including a 50,000-square-foot ballroom, which will be the largest in Indiana \u2014 will allow Visit Indy to host two citywide events at once, Heneghan said.\n\n\u201cWhereas now, there's only the ability to host one [citywide convention],\u201d she noted. \u201cThis hotel and the meeting space that it brings is going to elevate the level of business that we can do in the city.\n\n\u201cMeeting planners are incredibly excited to see that there is this level of luxury that's attached to a convention center,\u201d she added.\n\n\"There's a lot of developers who are pretty bullish about the Indy market moving forward, and so we aim to prove them to be smart about their investments.\u201d Leonard Hoops president and CEO of Visit Indy\n\nWhile additional hotel projects are underway, the Signia stands out because it \u201cwill bring new business to Indianapolis,\u201d Hoops noted. But it\u2019s taken a long time to get here, he added.\n\nAfter Visit Indy advocated for the Signia project, \u201cwe pretty much stopped advocating [for additional hotels] because that's a lot of rooms of inventory to add,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cBut there's a lot of developers who are doing these things on their own, who are pretty bullish about the Indy market moving forward, and so we aim to prove them to be smart about their investments.\u201d\n\nOngoing development\n\nOne of those developers is Ersal Ozdemir, the founder and owner of Keystone Group, which opened the InterContinental Indianapolis in February after a $120 million restoration of a historic downtown building.\n\nThe 170-room luxury hotel features 5,000 square feet of meetings and events space, including a 2,500-square-foot ballroom.\n\nBy the numbers +660% Indianapolis' year-on-year RevPAR increase during the 2024 solar eclipse, the highest of any U.S. market 932,000 Indianapolis hotel rooms booked on the back of convention demand in 2024 800 The number of convention center-adjacent rooms Signia by Hilton will bring to Indianapolis when it opens in 2026\n\n\u201cOur goal is that we not only want to develop great buildings, but we want to help to elevate the city,\u201d Ozdemir told Hotel Dive. For Keystone Group, that meant spending more than anticipated to create a rooftop bar, which has already hosted elite gatherings for events travelers, Ozdemir shared.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing a lot more interest in that upper-upscale, boutique side,\u201d said Hoops. Other hotels under construction downtown include a Kimpton \u2014 which, like InterContinental, is part of IHG Hotels & Resorts\u2019 growing luxury and lifestyle portfolio \u2014 and the Shinola Hotel, a project from Detroit-based luxury design brand Shinola. Meanwhile, Ennismore plans to open a 21c Museum Hotel in a historic city hall building in 2028, inclusive of the art-focused hotel brand\u2019s largest-ever gallery space.\n\nOutside of downtown, Marriott International\u2019s Westin brand broke ground last month on a $205.8 million hotel at Indianapolis International Airport.\n\nExisting hotels are getting upgrades, too: Omni Severin Hotel recently underwent a $24 million renovation, and both the JW Marriott Indianapolis and Crowne Plaza Indianapolis recently unveiled the results of their $15 million revamps, according to Visit Indy.\n\n\u201cWe not only want to develop great buildings, but we want to help to elevate the city.\u201d Ersal Ozdemir founder and owner, Keystone Group\n\nAccording to Ozdemir, the difference between downtown Indianapolis now and 20 years ago is like \u201cday and night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've not been to another city that has so many hotels either built or getting ready to be built within walking distance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city\u2019s walkability is a big selling point for its hotels, according to Visit Indy. Indianapolis was designed by Alexander Ralston, an apprentice of Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant, who designed Washington, D.C. The city\u2019s layout, then, is not dissimilar from the capital\u2019s, Hoops said. Like D.C., many of Indianapolis\u2019 streets are named after states, and a Monument Circle in the city center features roads spiking out in diagonals.\n\nHeneghan said she notes the city\u2019s walkability when speaking to event planners. \u201cEverything is connected,\u201d she said.\n\nFuture projects\n\nIn terms of citywide conventions, Hoops said, Indianapolis rivals the best. \u201cWe compete absolutely nationally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go up against Orlando, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe next step is building a leisure travel segment that matches, he noted, adding that Indianapolis is looking to Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWe're just a little bit behind where Austin was, and where Nashville was, a few years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth of those cities, however, are known for their music scenes \u2014 something Indianapolis hopes to beef up with its forthcoming 4,000-seat music venue by Live Nation Entertainment. At the same time, Visit Indy plans on creating more activations around the White River, which flows through downtown.\n\nMeanwhile, sports tourism \u2014 such as the recent WNBA All-Star Game \u2014 continues to drive leisure travelers to the city.\n\n\"People kind of sleep on Indianapolis, but I remind them that Paris is a flat city with a river, and so is Indianapolis,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cTheir only advantage is a 2,000-year headstart.\u201d",

This hotel will be the city's tallest and connect to the Indiana Convention Center via skywalk. Adding 90,000 square feet of meeting space, including Indiana's largest ballroom, the Signia will enable Indianapolis to host two citywide conventions at once. This significantly elevates the level of business the city can do.\n\n**Why it matters:** This development surge, led by the Signia, elevates Indianapolis\u2019 events market to compete with major cities like Chicago. It expands the city's capacity to host citywide conventions, moving from one to two concurrently. The influx of luxury hotels challenges a potential consensus that Indianapolis is not a top-tier destination for high-end business or leisure travel. Meeting planners are reportedly excited by the new level of luxury tied to the convention center.\n\n**The big picture:** Indianapolis is experiencing an \"explosion\" in hotel development, primarily driven by strong convention demand. The city saw record hotel room nights booked in 2024, with nine of its top ten demand days ever occurring this year. Developers are \"bullish\" on the Indianapolis market, investing in a broader wave of higher-end hotel projects. The city's unique walkability, due to its design, is a key selling point for event planners.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **+660%:** Indianapolis' year-on-year RevPAR increase during the 2024 solar eclipse.\n*   **932,000:** Hotel room nights booked in Indianapolis in 2024 due to convention demand.\n*   **800:** Rooms Signia by Hilton will add to Indianapolis' convention center-adjacent inventory.\n*   **90,000:** Square feet of meeting space at the new Signia hotel, including Indiana\u2019s largest ballroom.\n*   **2026:** Year the Signia hotel is expected to open.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Hilton:** Developing the 800-room luxury Signia hotel in downtown Indianapolis.\n*   **Kathy Heneghan:** General Manager of Signia by Hilton Indianapolis, discussing the hotel's impact.\n*   **Visit Indy:** Destination management organization leading efforts to attract conventions and tourism.\n*   **Leonard Hoops:** President and CEO of Visit Indy, bullish on Indianapolis' market growth.\n*   **Ersal Ozdemir:** Founder and owner of Keystone Group, developing luxury hotels downtown.\n*   **Keystone Group:** Opened the InterContinental Indianapolis after a $120 million restoration.\n*   **IHG Hotels & Resorts:** Has Kimpton and InterContinental hotels as part of its growing luxury portfolio.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The opening of Hilton's Signia hotel next year, elevating Indianapolis' convention capacity.\n*   Indianapolis aims to build its leisure travel segment, inspired by Austin and Nashville.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Indianapolis is rapidly transforming into a top-tier luxury convention and leisure destination.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nRegional properties were a bright spot for Caesars Entertainment in the second quarter of 2025, as the operator posted decreased revenues in Las Vegas amid softer market demand there, CEO Tom Reeg detailed in an earnings report published Tuesday.\n\nThe hotel operator opened properties in New Orleans and Danville, Virginia, in recent months, which primarily drove year-over-year regional segment net revenue growth of 3.6% in Q2, according to the report.\n\nIn its Las Vegas segment, though, Caesars posted a 3.7% year-over-year decline in net revenues in the quarter. The disappointing results come on the heels of dampened demand in Caesars\u2019 Las Vegas hospitality verticals, Reeg shared, though group demand appears strong going forward.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCaesars\u2019 Las Vegas segment was \u201csofter than last year\u201d in the second quarter, as the market\u2019s booking window contracted, Reeg said during an earnings call Tuesday. Caesars\u2019 adjusted EBITDA declined 8% year over year in Las Vegas in the quarter.\n\n\u201c[The] booking window in Vegas is about as short as I\u2019ve seen it at this point,\u201d Reeg said. \u201cVegas started leaking as of May, [and] that leak accelerated into June.\u201d\n\nCaesars\u2019 Las Vegas segment was down 27,000 room nights in the second quarter, Reeg stated on the call, noting a dip in international visitors.\n\n\u201cInternational business, particularly Canadian, is softer. If you look at our missing room nights this year, Canadians are a significant piece of that,\u201d Reeg said.\n\nThe U.S. is on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025 following recent U.S. government actions, the World Travel & Tourism Council reported in May. Elevated macroeconomic concerns are also poised to impact hotel performance this year and next, CoStar and Tourism Economics forecasted last month.\n\nAt the NYU International Hospitality Investment Forum in New York City last month, STR President Amanda Hite said hotel demand nationwide for July and August was down compared to 2024 due partly to travelers\u2019 now-shortened booking windows.\n\nReeg expects Caesars\u2019 third-quarter results in Sin City to be soft as well, though he noted that group demand is promising beyond that.\n\nThere is a \u201cvery strong group calendar\u201d for Caesars in the fourth quarter of this year as well as the first and second quarters of 2026, according to Reeg.\n\nMeanwhile, in the regional segment, \u201cNew Orleans had another very strong quarter, and has picked up the pace in July,\u201d Reeg said. Caesars\u2019 recently opened resort in Virginia \u201ccontinues to perform extraordinarily well,\u201d he added.\n\nJust after the close of the quarter, Caesars debuted the rebranded Caesars Republic Lake Tahoe Hotel & Casino in Nevada.

This increase was driven by the opening of new properties in New Orleans and Danville, Virginia. In contrast, the company's Las Vegas segment experienced a 3.7% year-over-year decline in net revenues. Caesars' adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas also fell 8% year over year due to dampened demand and a contracted booking window. A significant piece of missing room nights was attributed to softer international business, particularly Canadian visitors.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis data reveals a divergence in performance, with regional properties acting as a bright spot against declining revenues in Las Vegas. The weakness in Caesars' core Las Vegas market, marked by a contracted booking window and reduced international visitors, suggests a significant shift in demand dynamics. This performance might challenge any consensus view that assumes uniform strength across all of Caesars' operations or the broader Las Vegas hospitality market. The expectation for continued soft Q3 results in Las Vegas indicates a sustained period of challenge for that segment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBroader industry forecasts support the observed trends, with the U.S. on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025 due to recent U.S. government actions. Elevated macroeconomic concerns are also poised to impact hotel performance this year and next, according to CoStar and Tourism Economics. Hotel demand nationwide for July and August was down compared to 2024, partly due to travelers\u2019 shortened booking windows.

        "summary": "**Headline:** DC Council Preserves Tipped Wage, Overriding Voters Aiding Businesses.\n\n**Key details:**\nThe Washington D.C. city council approved a measure preserving the tipped subminimum wage. This action overrides the will of voters for the second time in seven years. The amendment to Initiative 82 sets the minimum wage for tipped workers at $10 per hour until July 1, 2026. Gradual increases are then permitted until 2034, when employers must pay 75% of the district\u2019s minimum wage. This information was detailed in a statement from the National Restaurant Association.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis decision impacts labor costs for businesses employing tipped workers in D.C. By preserving the subminimum wage, businesses may face slower wage increases than if Initiative 82 had been fully repealed. This challenges a potential consensus view that wages for tipped workers would rapidly rise due to prior voter intent. The delay in full wage increases until 2034 provides a longer adjustment period for businesses. It indicates the council's willingness to override voter decisions concerning labor compensation.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis marks the second time in seven years the D.C. city council has overridden voters' will on this specific issue. The council's vote enacted an amendment to Initiative 82, rather than a full repeal of the measure. This recent action follows a council vote less than two months prior to pause other wage increases. The decision directly shapes the minimum wage structure for tipped employees within the capital.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Second time in seven years the council overrode voters.\n*   Tipped workers' minimum wage held at $10 an hour until July 1, 2026.\n*   Gradual increases permitted until 2034.\n*   By 2034, employers pay 75% of the district's minimum wage.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Washington, D.C., city council:** Approved a measure preserving the tipped subminimum wage, overriding voter will.\n*   **National Restaurant Association:** Issued a statement detailing the approved amendment to the law.\n*   **Voters:** Their will regarding the tipped subminimum wage was overridden by the city council.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The $10 an hour minimum wage for tipped workers will remain in effect until July 1, 2026.\n*   Gradual increases are permitted thereafter until 2034, when the 75% threshold is met.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDC Council vote slows tipped wage hikes, easing cost pressure on businesses.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDon Brock is a retired senior executive with more than 25 years of experience in food and consumer product manufacturing. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nManufacturing in the United States isn\u2019t romantic.\n\nDespite what glossy ads, political speeches and tech expos suggest \u2014 gleaming robots, spotless factories and the promise of bringing jobs back home \u2014 the reality is more brutal.\n\nI\u2019ve learned it\u2019s steel-toed boots, long hours and being measured by your last shift, your last run, your last screw-up. And for those who stay it\u2019s also about pride, grit and mastery. But none of it comes easily.\n\nAs the country talks about reviving American industry, the real question is whether our workforce \u2014 and our expectations \u2014 are ready for what that truly demands. These are some of my lessons from decades on the job.\n\nThe entry point is hard, fast and underpaid\n\nMost people don't \"choose\" manufacturing; they land in it. Sometimes from a technical school. Often from circumstance. You get your foot in the door \u2014 running a filler, packing pallets, loading raw materials \u2014 and you realize quickly that no one's waiting to hand you anything.\n\nThe work is physical. The pay at the beginning is barely enough. Maybe $18 an hour, if you're lucky. Maybe rotating 12-hour shifts with no child care. The benefits vary widely \u2014 union shops can be solid; non-union ones often tread the fine line between acceptable and exploitative.\n\nAnd the unspoken reality is you may experience injuries, repetitive stress, line fatigue and night shifts that screw up your sleep for years.\n\nThe climb has no map, few guides\n\nMoving up in manufacturing requires more than hustle. It takes visibility, timing and often politics.\n\nThe best operators don't always become supervisors. The best supervisors don't always get promoted. And there's usually no clear pathway \u2014 just a mix of luck, attrition and whoever happens to be watching.\n\nMiddle management? That's where careers either advance or stall. You're stuck between the C-suite's cost obsession and the frontline's daily chaos. You make decisions no one thanks you for and get blamed for outcomes you didn't control.\n\nLeadership in manufacturing is not about glossy strategy decks. It's about walking the floor when you're exhausted, defusing conflicts with HR breathing down your neck, keeping lines running when half the crew calls out and still hitting a margin target that was set by someone who's never touched a valve or heard a piston seize.\n\nThe culture is a mixed bag\n\nThe culture varies. Some plants are toxic: blame-heavy, turf-driven, unsafe. Others are tight-knit, even familial, where veterans look out for rookies and you solve problems with duct tape and a handshake.\n\nBut make no mistake: ego, burnout and generational divides are everywhere. The old guard resents the new hires. The latest hires roll their eyes at \"the way we've always done it.\" HR often spends more time rolling out diversity initiatives than addressing the real, unresolved safety issues on the third shift, where the newest, least experienced workers face the highest risks.\n\nAnd most outsiders \u2014 executives, consultants and media \u2014 don\u2019t understand what it takes to build something, fix something or keep it running continuously 24/7 without failure.\n\nThe rewards are real, but earned\n\nIf you survive the grind \u2014 and learn to lead \u2014 manufacturing offers something no desk job can. You can point to something and say, \"We made that.\"\n\nYou learn systems. You learn people. You learn what it means to stand up under pressure and keep going when everything's breaking. And for some, you learn how to transform not just product, but culture \u2014 how to lead turnarounds, build teams and leave plants better than you found them.\n\nYes, the money gets better. Six figures is attainable if you transition into operations leadership, technical direction or supply chain management. But you'll earn every penny in sleepless nights, holiday calls and constant stress.\n\nAnd still, you might get laid off after a merger and reorganized when a private equity group cuts costs or pushed out when you're \"too expensive\" after building the whole damn system.\n\nIt's either a calling, or it breaks you\n\nManufacturing, although not easy, has been a productive career for me. However, are we willing to invest in what it takes to make that the case for everyone?\n\nManufacturing will harden you, humble you, and \u2014 if you let it \u2014 shape you into something fierce and capable. But it\u2019s not for the faint of heart or the glory seeker.\n\nIt\u2019s for those who believe in execution over excuses, in teams over titles and in building things that matter \u2014 even when no one\u2019s looking.\n\nSo, what\u2019s it like to build a career in U.S. manufacturing? It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s real work.\n\nAs the country rallies around the idea of bringing manufacturing back home, we need to ask: Is this truly what we want? And if so, are we prepared to invest in the education, training and cultural readiness it demands?",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon repeatedly violated the National Labor Relations Act when supervisors and loss prevention personnel prohibited off-duty employees from engaging in union-organizing and other protected activity in warehouse parking lots in Chicago, St. Louis and New York state, an administrative law judge for the National Labor Relations Board held July 23.\n\nThe incidents involved similar actions by Amazon\u2019s agents, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings in Amazon.com Services LLC and Duzinkas. For example, in one incident, two off-duty Amazon employees were in the parking lot of a Chicago-area warehouse handing out petitions seeking to raise Amazon\u2019s base minimum wage. A loss prevention agent asked what they were doing and told them he would call the police if they didn\u2019t leave. The police did arrive, and they left, according to the findings.\n\nIn ruling against Amazon, the ALJ explained that NLRB has long held employers may not bar off-duty employees from outside nonworking areas, including parking lots. Amazon violated Section 8(a)1 of the NLRA when it tried to do this to keep off-duty employees from engaging in protected activity, the judge held. Amazon also violated Section 8(a)1 when it called the police to further bar protected activity, the ALJ said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSection 8(a)1 of the NLRA prohibits employers from interfering with or restraining employees from exercising the statute\u2019s core rights, spelled out in Section 7 of the act.\n\nThese core rights \u2014 considered \u201cprotected activity\u201d and often referred to as \u201cSection 7 rights\u201d \u2014 include the right to organize and \u201cengage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d\n\nThe issues here arose in 2022 and 2023, during a heated union campaign to organize Amazon warehouse workers at multiple facilities. The ALJ found Amazon\u2019s actions in telling off-duty employees to leave the parking lots while they were trying to garner union support from co-workers and campaign for better working conditions and pay interfered with their Section 7 rights and violated Section 8(a)1.\n\nOne incident took place outside Amazon\u2019s St. Peters, Missouri, warehouse, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings. An off-duty employee active in an organizing committee stationed himself in the parking lot to get co-workers to sign a petition demanding improvements to warehouse safety.\n\nAs the off-duty employee was putting flyers on vehicles near the facility entrance, a security officer from a third-party vendor wearing an Amazon badge approached him, the ALJ found. The officer told the off-duty employee he wasn\u2019t allowed to distribute the flyers in the parking lot and that if the officer went inside to get the police and loss prevention, they would tell him the same thing. The employee immediately left.\n\nThe ALJ ruled that the officer was acting as an agent for Amazon and his statements were unlawful. This was because pursuant to an established NLRB holding, \u201cthe distribution by off-duty employees of union literature in company parking lots is clearly protected by Section 7 of the Act, absent a showing that any work performed there is integral to business operations,\u201d the ALJ noted, quoting NLRB.\n\nThe case also offers a tip on employer no-solicitation policies. Amazon\u2019s policy started out valid by stating that solicitation by employees was prohibited on company property during working time, the ALJ said.\n\nBut the policy ultimately violated the NLRA because it failed to make clear to a reasonable employee \u201cthat solicitation is permitted in work areas during non-working time,\u201d the judge held.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Amazon Found Guilty of Illegally Blocking Union Organizers\n\n**Key details:**\nAn administrative law judge for the National Labor Relations Board ruled Amazon repeatedly violated the National Labor Relations Act on July 23. The violations involved supervisors and loss prevention personnel prohibiting off-duty employees from union organizing in warehouse parking lots. Incidents occurred in Chicago, St. Louis, and New York state, where employees sought wage increases or safety improvements. The judge found Amazon's agents unlawfully interfered with protected activity, including calling the police. Amazon's no-solicitation policy also violated the NLRA by failing to clarify permitted solicitation during non-working time.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis ruling confirms Amazon's agents unlawfully interfered with employees' Section 7 rights to organize. It reinforces the long-held NLRB position that employers cannot bar off-duty employees from non-working areas for union activity. The findings challenge any consensus that companies can restrict off-duty employee organizing in parking lots. Amazon's internal no-solicitation policy was also found illegal, underscoring the need for clear communication on employee rights.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe National Labor Relations Act prohibits employers from interfering with employees' core rights, known as Section 7 rights. These rights include organizing and engaging in concerted activities for collective bargaining or mutual aid. The violations occurred during a heated 2022-2023 campaign to unionize Amazon warehouse workers. The ALJ found Amazon's actions, like telling off-duty employees to leave parking lots, interfered with these protected activities.

Workday also claimed that HiredScore was \u201ca separate product, built on a wholly separate technology platform\u201d that can run on any kind of applicant tracking software.\n\nAI in hiring continues to be a point of contention in the employment law landscape.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Court expands Workday AI discrimination suit, orders customer data disclosure.\n\n**Key details:** A judge ruled Workday must provide a list of customers using HiredScore artificial intelligence features in their hiring process. This order came from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday. The ruling expands a collective action lawsuit, now including individuals whose applications were scored, sorted, ranked, or screened using HiredScore AI features. Workday had argued HiredScore and its Candidate Skills Match had \"material differences in the scoring algorithms\" and that HiredScore was \"a separate product.\"\n\n**Why it matters:** This ruling broadens the scope of the existing collective action against Workday by including HiredScore AI users, potentially increasing Workday's legal exposure. It challenges Workday's assertion that HiredScore is a distinct product with different algorithms. The decision highlights growing legal scrutiny and regulatory challenges for automated decision-making tools in human resources. This could disrupt the current consensus view of minimal oversight for HR AI, signaling rising compliance risks for the industry.\n\n**The big picture:** The lawsuit alleges Workday's AI-based applicant recommendation software negatively affected job candidates aged 40 and up. AI in hiring continues to be a point of contention in the employment law landscape. New York City already restricted AI in hiring in 2022, with its laws going into effect in 2023, requiring audits and candidate notification. California and Colorado are also slated to have AI hiring regulations on the books in 2026.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **40 and up:** Age group of candidates allegedly negatively affected by AI software.\n*   **2022:** Year New York City restricted AI in hiring.\n*   **2023:** Year New York City's AI hiring laws went into effect.\n*   **2026:** Year California and Colorado are slated to have AI hiring regulations.\n*   **Aug. 20:** Deadline for Workday to provide its list of customers.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Workday Inc.:** Company ordered to provide customer list for HiredScore AI features in an ongoing lawsuit.\n*   **HiredScore:** Artificial intelligence technology acquired by Workday, central to the lawsuit's expanded scope.\n*   **U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California:** The court that issued the ruling against Workday on Tuesday.\n*   **Judge Rita Lin:** The judge who previously stated that Workday's logistical hurdles to identifying members were \"not insurmountable.\"\n*   **New York City:** Entity that restricted AI in hiring in 2022, with its laws going into effect in 2023.\n*   **California:** State slated to have AI hiring regulations on its books in 2026.\n*   **Colorado:** State slated to have AI hiring regulations on its books in 2026.\n*   **LinkedIn:** Private company mentioned as adding AI tools to assist recruiters.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Workday must provide the list of its customers who enabled the HiredScore technology by August 20.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Court order expands Workday's AI lawsuit, signaling growing regulatory risks.",

And while the guidance is aimed at federal contractors, grant recipients and others who receive federal funds, management-side attorneys said it\u2019s instructive for all employers.\n\nHR practices under DOJ scrutiny\n\nDOJ took aim at a number of HR practices in its guidance, including hiring.\n\nPolicies that mandate representation violate federal law by creating unequal treatment or disadvantaging otherwise qualified candidates, the agency said, offering the example of a research institute that adopts a policy requiring that all interview slates for faculty positions include a minimum number of candidates from specific racial groups and rejecting otherwise qualified candidates.\n\nLikewise, hiring criteria that \u2014 while neutral on its face \u2014 may function as a proxy for protected characteristics, is illegal, DOJ said. According to the agency, this can include the practice of hiring for \u201ccultural competence\u201d or \u201clived experience,\u201d as well as geographic targeting.\n\nDOJ also cautioned employers against race-segregated training. For example, a university DEI training program that requires participants to separate into race-based groups for discussions and prohibits individuals of other races from participating in specific sessions would be illegal, the agency said.\n\n\u2018Good insight\u2019 for HR\n\nThe agency\u2019s guidance follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on alleged discrimination masquerading as DEI. The president used executive orders to call on agencies to issue guidance and roll back Biden-era DEI initiatives, among other directives.\n\n\u201cThis Department of Justice will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in illegal discrimination,\u201d said Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a statement announcing the guidance. \u201cThis guidance will ensure we are serving the American people and not ideological agendas.\u201d\n\nDOJ\u2019s guide follows similar efforts from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which also enforces nondiscrimination laws.

Employers can also view the guidance through the lens of their organizational risk tolerance.\u201d\n\nThe document also may foreshadow similar, but more widely applicable, efforts from EEOC. \u201cWith the EEOC\u2019s quorum likely to be established shortly, further guidance (and other action, such as rescission of guidance) is anticipated,\u201d Shivers said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAutumn Adkins Graves is head of school of St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield School, an age 2 through grade 12 independent school in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWe adults have lost our way.\n\nWe need to figure out how to right the ship for our children \u2014 the sooner, the better.\n\nAs an educator and independent school leader, I can speculate about how we got here, but that doesn\u2019t matter as much as how we collectively fix the broken infrastructure.\n\nOne place to start is by teaching students how to be exemplary citizens \u2014 the kind of people who focus on making the world a better place, not just on their own self-interests.\n\nAutumn Adkins Graves Permission granted by Autumn Adkins Graves\n\nOf course, this raises a chicken-egg conundrum. To raise outstanding citizens, do we begin by rethinking how we teach important subjects and lessons? Or is it more important to challenge students to think holistically, apply their lessons in a broader context, and envision a world \u2014 one they can help shape \u2014 beyond the year 2025?\n\nThe answer is both.\n\nThe task is enormous. After all, we have to teach students how to thrive in an ever-changing world, a society that we may not completely understand ourselves.\n\nOn another level, basic civics lessons can \u2014 and should be \u2014 woven more explicitly into curricula.\n\nOn a fundamental level, that means teaching students how to work together in teams \u2014 whether academic, athletic or performing arts.\n\nSelflessness should be in, while selfishness should be on the way out. We\u2019ve become a society of \u201cme,\u201d not \u201cwe.\u201d We are now a country of people who value the highlight dunk reel over passing up a shot for a teammate, and we are indirectly teaching that \u201cme first\u201d mindset to our students.\n\nTrue leadership isn\u2019t always about being in charge or being credited as No. 1. Sometimes, it\u2019s about supporting a team, pushing a shared vision forward, and finding contentment in playing a small but vital role in a team effort.\n\nThere\u2019s real value in contributing to something bigger than oneself, even without the title or limelight. If we can shift that mindset and rethink that paradigm, we\u2019ll be making positive strides.\n\nAt a larger level, it also means educating students about how decisions and laws are established, not just in the three branches of the federal government but also at the state and local levels.\n\nA student needs to realize why it matters to stay abreast of current events and the importance of participating in democracy.\n\nNearly 64% of people voted in the last presidential election, but far fewer voted in off-year or local elections. Yet those are the elections that impact people and communities the most.\n\nMoreover, because so many people avoid voting, too many young people don\u2019t know how the government works in America or feel apathetic to the incremental changes that occur at the local level.\n\nRather than seeing elected officials as public servants, they identify officeholders as political figures or, even worse, career politicians or celebrities \u2014 people who are only interested in making decisions to ensure victory in their reelection campaign rather than determining what is best for their constituents in the short or long run.\n\nAlso, it is time to tweak the way we teach media literacy: Too many students accept TikTok and Instagram posts at face value without considering the source or weighing the credibility of the content creator.\n\nMoreover, schools can empower students to solve issues instead of getting stuck on identifying problems.\n\nToo frequently, we fixate on what\u2019s broken instead of creating a better way. Rather than pointing fingers, shifting the focus can make a difference. When students learn to be solution-makers, not just problem-identifiers, they lower their toxic anxiety levels and instead set themselves up to succeed in tomorrow\u2019s world.\n\nAs educators, shaping students to think like exemplary citizens means adjusting our approaches so we enable students to build confidence in their abilities to apply their understanding in a \"real-world\" context.\n\nThings won\u2019t change today, this month, this year or even this decade.

This involves explicitly weaving basic civics lessons into curricula, emphasizing teamwork, and promoting selflessness. Students need to understand how laws are established across all government levels and the importance of participating in democracy. Additionally, schools should teach media literacy and empower students to be \"solution-makers\" rather than just problem-identifiers.\n\n**Why it matters:** The author believes that a collective effort is needed to \"fix the broken infrastructure\" by teaching students how to be exemplary citizens. This approach aims to shift students from a \"me first\" mindset to one of selflessness and teamwork. It seeks to ensure students understand government functions at all levels and can critically evaluate media. The information provided does not challenge a current consensus view on a specific company or industry, as this article focuses solely on educational philosophy and societal improvement.\n\n**The big picture:** The author, an independent school leader, contends that adults have \"lost their way\" and need to \"right the ship for our children.\" The broader context is a society where a \"me first\" mindset is prevalent, valuing individual highlight reels over team effort. Many young people are described as apathetic about government and struggle with media literacy, accepting social media posts at face value. The aim is to reverse these trends to foster a society of exemplary citizens.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Nearly 64% of people voted in the last presidential election.\n*   Far fewer people voted in off-year or local elections.\n*   St. Anne's-Belfield School serves students age 2 through grade 12.\n*   Students should envision a world beyond the year 2025.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Autumn Adkins Graves: Head of St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield School, advocating for societal and educational reform.\n*   St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield School: Independent school in Charlottesville, Virginia, led by the author of the article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Educators advocate for teaching civics and selflessness to shape future citizens.",

The legislation also rejects several other funding reforms proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe bill would require timely awarding of formula grants by the Education Department to states and districts. For several weeks in July, the Education Department and the White House's Office of Management and Budget withheld $6.2 billion in grant funding that states and districts expected access to starting July 1.\n\n\n\nThat funding at pre-approved FY 2025 spending levels was released after the Trump administration conducted a \"programmatic review\" and added \"guardrails\" to ensure the funds would not violate executive orders or administration policy, a senior administration official at OMB told K-12 Dive in an email July 25.\n\nEducators, parents, education organizations, and Republican and Democratic lawmakers had pressured the administration to make the funds available, citing that the disruption in funds was causing school program cuts, canceled contracts and staff layoffs.\n\nIn total, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the Education Department in FY 26 at $79 billion, according to the bill text. That's $12.3 billion more than President Donald Trump's proposal of $66.7 billion. In the current fiscal year, the Education Department is funded at $78.7 billion.\n\n\"The bill also supports families by investing in education and affordable child care, which promotes financial stability for working parents and benefits our economy,\" said Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\n\nThe proposed education budget \u2014 which was included in funding legislation for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and related agencies \u2014 passed the committee in a 26-3 vote.\n\n\"Our bills reject devastating cuts \u2014 and reject many of this administration\u2019s absurd proposals \u2014 like dismantling the Department of Education,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, in her opening remarks.\n\n\"We all know President Trump cannot dismantle the Department of Education or ship education programs to other agencies. Authorizing laws prevent that. Appropriations laws prevent that,\" Murray said.\n\nTrump has said he wants to reduce the size and scope of the federal government and give states and localities more fiscal decision-making authority while reducing bureaucracy.\n\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order to shutter the Education Department to the \"maximum extent appropriate.\" Congress, however, would need to approve the closing of the agency.\n\nMaintaining separate formula grants\n\nThe Trump administration's budget proposed a new K-12 Simplified Funding Program that would merge 18 current competitive formula funding grant programs into one $2 billion formula grant program. The administration said the SFP would spur innovation and give states more spending flexibility and decision-making power.\n\nThe Senate Appropriation Committee instead rejected that plan by keeping the formula grants separate. The Senate plan would provide a $50 million increase over FY 2025 spending for both Title I-A funding for low-income schools and districts, and for special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\nThe bill would maintain current spending levels, except for a few reductions, across other K-12 formula and competitive grant programs targeting improvements in teaching and learning, according to a bill summary from Murray's office.\n\nOther notable spending proposals from the Senate Appropriations Committee FY 26 bill include:\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights would maintain level spending at $140 million.\n\nThe Institute of Education Sciences would be funded at $793 million, level with the FY 25 budget.\n\nTitle I and IDEA would be funded at $18.5 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. The two grant programs make up the largest share of funding for K-12 at the Education Department.\n\nUnder the HHS portion of the legislation, the committee recommends increasing funding for the early childhood learning programs Head Start and the Child Care and Community Block grant by $85 million each to $12.4 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations bill will now be considered by the House and full Senate.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRelationship building is the most important skill Robert Alemany says he brings to his role as director of facilities at The Buckley School, a private K-9 school in New York City.\n\nRobert Alemany Permission granted by The Buckley School, NYC\n\nWith a background in teaching and business management, he had to learn the technical side of facility management from scratch when he shifted to that line of work about five years ago. Yet it\u2019s people management that he relies on most to succeed in his role overseeing a four-building campus of close to 400 students, he says.\n\nAmong his big challenges this year is meeting the energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One of the school\u2019s older buildings needs upgrades if it\u2019s to meet the city\u2019s tough building performance standards. To learn about his career path and how he\u2019s tackling the challenges that come with the job, Facilities Dive sat down with Alemany for a short conversation.\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nFACILITIES DIVE: How did you become involved in facilities management?\n\nROBERT ALEMANY: It was accidental. I started out teaching at public schools in different roles. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher forever and got an MBA. I thought I\u2019d go work in finance, but I kept getting these managerial roles at educational places, then got a job at a church in New York City. The church bought a parking garage, gutted it and turned it into this really contemporary facility. They decided that Monday through Saturday they would rent it out as space and just use it for church on Sundays. They used the income from the event space to pay off the mortgage.\n\nI ran operations there for a while. They had somebody taking care of the building [who departed, then they] said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you step into this role?\u201d I was like, \u201cI really appreciate it, but I don\u2019t know which way to hold a screwdriver, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m your guy.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe appreciate your management skills and the kind of person you are. You can get the skills to excel in this role,\u201d and they gave me a shot. I started cold calling facilities managers in similar roles, getting books and doing online courses and just loved it.\n\nA few years down the line, a position opened up at the school I\u2019m at now and I thought it was a perfect fit; I had these newly acquired facility skills and I\u2019d been a teacher. I know what they experience every day. That led me to where I am now.\n\nTalk about your training.\n\nALEMANY: I continue to build off what I learned and got my real estate license. I still talk to people in the field, invest in books and do online courses whenever I can. You just never stop talking to people. Even when we have vendors come in, I ask, \u201cWhy? What kind of stuff are you doing here?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important skill the job requires?\n\nALEMANY: People management, which is not something that [typically] comes to mind. When people think of facilities, they think of pipes and HVAC systems and all that. But there are people that are involved in maintaining and repairing that equipment. So it\u2019s about building relationships, especially in a city as busy as New York City. To get emergency service here, for example, relationships make a difference. We might not be on the top of the list of a company. We\u2019re just a small fish in the pond. But by building relationships, we become a priority for others. And when you have to negotiate contracts and work through different things, people skills are at the top.\n\nAre there laws or regulations that cause you the most challenge? How do you manage compliance?\n\nALEMANY: Here in New York City, it\u2019s Local Law 97 which is the law that\u2019s governing carbon emissions. One of the buildings was last renovated in 1974. We\u2019re fine for this year, but by 2030 we\u2019re not going to meet the threshold that they\u2019ve set. We\u2019re going to be fined about $35,000 or something like that. So we\u2019re undergoing a renovation project and engaging architects and some engineers to help us with that to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nAs it relates to school buildings, some of it is health department stuff because we\u2019ve got a nurse here. So, it\u2019s making sure that chemical cleaners are away and out of reach of kids. We also face a lot of the regulations that other buildings do, but when they come in and do their inspections, they\u2019re a lot stricter with us because we\u2019re a school.\n\nWhat keeps you up at night?\n\nALEMANY: Just the idea that every facilities manager has: that something weird is going to go wrong, where you forgot if you did something or forgot to talk to someone. The unexpected. But that comes with the role. There\u2019s a level of unpredictability, but it drives you to be as well organized as you can and think through things. Even if something doesn\u2019t happen, you think through multiple steps and say, \u201cOkay, if it did, what would I do? How would I respond?\u201d\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone who\u2019s interested in becoming a facility manager?\n\nALEMANY: Be humble, ask questions and learn from those around you. There are a lot of people that have done this before, and it\u2019s not just facility managers, but those that have worked in the trades that love to share their passion for what they do. Don\u2019t try to re-create the wheel. Absorb knowledge and create friendships and relationships. If anybody would want to pursue the career, I would encourage them to do it, because it really is a great career.\n\nDid you have a unique journey into facilities management? Are you managing through challenges others could benefit from learning about? If you\u2019re interested in sharing your story with others in your field, Facilities Dive would appreciate hearing from you. Send an email to [email protected].\n\nCorrection: We have updated this story to correct the number of students at the school and clarify Alemany\u2019s remarks about the age and condition of one building and his career path.",

One of the school's older buildings, last renovated in 1974, needs upgrades to avoid substantial fines by 2030. Alemany emphasizes that \"people management\" and relationship-building are his most critical skills, even more so than technical knowledge. These skills are vital for securing emergency services and negotiating contracts in New York City.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information highlights the growing financial and operational pressures on organizations, including schools, due to increasingly strict building performance standards like Local Law 97. It challenges a common view that facilities management is purely technical, asserting that interpersonal skills are paramount for navigating complex urban environments and achieving compliance. The required major renovation projects and potential fines indicate significant capital expenditures and ongoing costs for property owners.\n\n**The big picture:** Robert Alemany accidentally entered facilities management five years ago, having a background in teaching and business management, not technical building operations. He learned the technical side from scratch, initially at a church, and now oversees a four-building campus with nearly 400 students. New York City\u2019s Local Law 97 governs carbon emissions and requires buildings to meet specific performance thresholds.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   K-9: The Buckley School's grade levels.\n*   4: Number of buildings on the school campus.\n*   Close to 400: Number of students at the school.\n*   1974: Year one school building was last renovated.\n*   $35,000: Estimated fine by 2030 for non-compliance with Local Law 97.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Robert Alemany:** Director of facilities at The Buckley School, managing energy efficiency and compliance challenges.\n*   **The Buckley School:** Private K-9 school in New York City facing upgrades due to Local Law 97.\n*   **Facilities Dive:** Publication that interviewed Robert Alemany about his career path and job challenges.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The school is currently undergoing a renovation project.\n*   Architects and engineers are engaged to help reduce the school's carbon footprint.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Compliance costs and strategic relationships are key in urban facilities management.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nStaffed Up is a monthly series examining school staffing best practices and solutions for teacher recruitment and retention. Catch up on previous installments here.\n\nThough it\u2019s expected that teacher turnover will decrease over the next few years, it\u2019s estimated that there were at least 49,000 vacant teaching positions and 400,000 underqualified educators instructing in classrooms nationwide during the 2024-25 school year, according to a project led by researchers from the University of Missouri and the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTexas has one of the highest teacher underqualification rates in the country, according to the University of Missouri-University of Pittsburgh research project.\n\nBetween the 2019-20 and 2024-25 school years, the total number of uncertified teachers in Texas jumped from 12,900 to 42,100, the Texas Education Agency found. That means 12% of the state\u2019s total teachers were uncertified by 2024-25 compared to 3.8% before the pandemic.\n\nOn top of that, 34% of the nearly 49,200 newly hired teachers in the 2023-24 school year had no Texas teaching certifications, according to TEA data.\n\nTexas makes a change\n\nTexas\u2019 growing reliance on uncertified teachers stems from the District of Innovation policy enacted by the state legislature in 2015.\n\nSome 986 Texas school districts participate in the program, which essentially automatically allows them to waive teacher certifications even though it was initially intended just for career and technical education teachers, said Jacob Kirksey, an assistant professor of education policy at Texas Tech University. Kirksey is also the associate director of the university\u2019s Center for Innovative Research in Change, Leadership and Education.\n\nSince the pandemic, however, there has been a \u201cdramatic spike\u201d in districts using the District of Innovation program to help with hiring uncertified teachers for foundational subject areas, Kirksey said.\n\nAccording to Kirksey\u2019s research, Texas\u2019 use of uncertified teachers with no classroom experience led to major learning losses for students. Those taught by new uncertified educators lost 4 months in reading and 3 months in math compared to their peers taught by certified instructors.\n\nBut a major shift is underway: HB2, a new state law enacted in June, will phase out all uncertified teachers in foundational content areas by the 2029-30 school year.\n\nNow in Texas, Kirksey said, \u201cwe've seen the extent of the damage. I think our legislature realized, \u2018OK, we created this hole, and now we need to put in the work to fix it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHB2 also incentivizes districts to hire high-quality teachers, he said. Under the new law, districts can receive $1,000 bonuses for every teacher they certify who previously lacked necessary credentials. Other larger bonuses can be earned from the state for mentoring and training teachers.\n\nSouth Carolina embraces uncertified teachers\n\nOn the flip side, some states are implementing laws that would allow more uncertified teachers to enter classrooms.\n\nIn South Carolina, for instance, a law enacted in May launched a five-year pilot program that will allow public school districts to hire uncertified teachers \u2014 capped at 10% of a district\u2019s instructional staff.\n\nThese teachers must have a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree with at least five years of relevant work experience in the subject area they are hired to instruct. Uncertified teachers must also enroll in an educator preparation program within their first three years of instruction.\n\nThe new law comes as South Carolina\u2019s school districts reported over 1,000 teacher vacancies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year \u2014 600 fewer vacancies, or a 35% decrease, from the previous year, according to a November 2024 analysis by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement.\n\nDena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association, said she\u2019s concerned that the law doesn\u2019t require uncertified teachers to take any foundational training before they can instruct students. \u201cThe business world and the education world are not the same,\u201d she said.\n\nUncertified teachers also don\u2019t have any incentive to stay in schools and won\u2019t face any consequences if they quit in the middle of their contract, Crews said. For instance, if one of these teachers doesn\u2019t know anything about classroom management and they can\u2019t get students\u2019 attention for days on end, they may not want to come back and teach.\n\n\u201cSo those kids are left at a deficit,\u201d Crews said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t help with the shortage. It helped with the shortage for a couple of days and really didn\u2019t do anything, because those kids didn\u2019t learn anything.\u201d\n\nOverall, Crews said she hopes South Carolina\u2019s uncertified teacher pilot program \u201cwill not become the norm\u201d for states and school districts nationwide.\n\nTexas has watched its uncertified teacher policies play out longer than other states, Kirksey said. Some lessons learned from watching this trend, he said, are that states facing educator shortages should avoid the easiest option, which is to \u201cderegulate everything\u201d for teaching regulations like in South Carolina. Instead, states should look for ways to prioritize training people to become high-quality educators.\n\n\u201cI do think it's just a matter of time before folks realize that if we choose to de-incentivize quality, then it's going to impact kids,\u201d Kirksey said.\n\nKirksey said he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a lack of qualified adults who can teach. Rather, there\u2019s \u201ca lack of educators who are willing to be in the classroom, who are well-prepared.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why states and districts ultimately need to address issues with teacher pay, burnout and job satisfaction, Kirksey said. In Texas, he said, \u201cI feel like, as a state, we finally recognize that.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** States Diverge Sharply on Uncertified Teacher Policies Amid Shortages\n\n**Key details:**\nNew research estimates 49,000 vacant teaching positions and 400,000 underqualified educators nationwide for 2024-25. Texas is reversing its policy, phasing out uncertified teachers in foundational subjects by 2029-30 and offering bonuses for certification. Conversely, South Carolina recently enacted a five-year pilot program allowing public school districts to hire more uncertified teachers, capped at 10% of instructional staff.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis sharp divergence in state policy highlights an ongoing debate about how to address teacher shortages while maintaining educational quality. Texas' decision to phase out uncertified teachers, following reported learning losses, directly challenges the view that deregulation is an effective, long-term solution. South Carolina's embrace of uncertified educators, despite concerns about training and retention, represents an opposing strategy. For investors, these policy shifts could signal changing demands for educational services, teacher training programs, or even long-term impacts on regional workforce quality.\n\n**The big picture:**\nDespite an expected decrease in overall teacher turnover, significant staffing challenges persist across U.S. schools. Texas' prior reliance on uncertified teachers was enabled by its 2015 District of Innovation policy, which saw a post-pandemic surge in use for core subjects. The article suggests that while states often choose deregulation as the \"easiest option\" for shortages, this approach can de-incentivize quality. Ultimately, addressing underlying issues like teacher pay, burnout, and job satisfaction is critical to attracting and retaining prepared educators.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **49,000:** Estimated vacant teaching positions nationwide during the 2024-25 school year.\n*   **400,000:** Estimated underqualified educators instructing nationwide during the 2024-25 school year.\n*   **12%:** Proportion of Texas' total teachers uncertified by 2024-25, up from 3.8% before the pandemic.\n*   **4 months reading, 3 months math:** Learning losses for students taught by new uncertified Texas educators.\n*   **$1,000:** Bonus districts can receive for every teacher they certify under Texas' new HB2 law.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **University of Missouri:** Led a research project on nationwide teacher vacancies and underqualified educators.\n*   **University of Pittsburgh:** Collaborated on the research project estimating national educator statistics.\n*   **Texas Education Agency (TEA):** Found a significant jump in uncertified teachers in Texas.\n*   **Jacob Kirksey:** Assistant professor at Texas Tech University whose research showed student learning losses.\n*   **Dena Crews:** President of the South Carolina Education Association, expressing concerns about SC's new law.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Texas' HB2 will phase out all uncertified teachers in foundational content areas by the 2029-30 school year.\n*   South Carolina's uncertified teacher pilot program will operate for five years.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nStates are taking divergent paths on teacher staffing, with quality linked to student learning.",

Average scores in reading dropped even further than the underwhelming results released in 2022.\n\nThe Education Department's call for states to seek waivers comes after \"parents have shown a desire for change when it comes to their children\u2019s education\" over the last five years, Sanon said. As a result, states have sought to expand school choice, overhaul literacy instruction based on the science of reading, and supported alternative school models like microschools and hybrid homeschooling, she added.\n\n\"These actions, combined with the 2024 NAEP results, show that the education sector is at an inflection point,\" Sanon told states.\n\nStates respond to calls for flexibility\n\nPresident Donald Trump, both as candidate and as president, has strongly pushed to give states more control over education spending and programming.\n\nTrump's crusade has thus far peaked with cutting the Education Department nearly in half and issuance of an executive order in March to close the agency \u201cto the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\u201d Full closure requires congressional approval.\n\nThe White House has also pushed for education block grants, which could potentially remove guaranteed funding for certain programs in favor of state flexibility to spend dollars as they see fit.\n\nPublic education and civil rights advocates have argued this could shortchange the students most in need of grant funding, while giving states room to pursue other priorities like school choice.\n\nHowever, Republican states have responded positively to the administration's plans.\n\nEven prior to McMahon's confirmation, 12 state chiefs wrote her on Jan. 28 urging her to issue state waivers and allow block grants once confirmed.\n\nJust days after Trump's executive order on winding down the Education Department, Republican state leaders echoed that call in letters to the department seeking more spending leeway.\n\nIndiana, whose state chief was among those to write McMahon in January, has already pitched a plan for its waiver, giving a glimpse into what states might seek.\n\nLast week, the Indiana Department of Education said in a statement it was \"pursuing a new opportunity to reduce federal red tape and increase state-level control over how federal education funds are used.\"\n\nThe department said its waiver request, which is in the public feedback stage, was inspired by and seeks to replicate the flexibilities the state experienced when spending federal pandemic aid under the Emergency Elementary and Secondary Education Emergency Relief fund.\n\nCurrently, the state said, it is spending \"a disproportionate share of time and resources\" on federal mandates like financial accounting, auditing, fiscal reporting and program monitoring.\n\nIndiana is seeking flexibility from programs including, but not limited to, state assessments, education of migrant children, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk youth, English Language Acquisition instruction, and academic enrichment programs.\n\nThe state said it would instead focus its dollars on literacy, STEM and high school redesign initiatives.",

For example, Ortiz recommends the \"four corners\u201d exercise, where each corner of the room or area is designated as \"agree,\" \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d \u201cdisagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly disagree.\" The teacher then makes different statements, and students move to the corner of the room that represents their opinion on each statement.\n\nThis activity gets students out of their seats and introduces content in an engaging way, as it provides space for their opinions and encourages interaction with peers.\n\nOrtiz also uses music to bring joy into the classroom. She recommends creating a classroom \\playlist where every student can contribute a song that helps them focus. Then, during independent work time, educators can play the playlist in the background.\n\nThis helps foster a sense of community in the classroom and makes them more motivated during independent work time, because they have contributed to the environment.\n\nDuring testing and midterm season, Ortiz ensures that there are wellness spaces available for her students. This involves setting aside the first 15 minutes of class for students to partner in a relaxing and fun activity, which she provides, such as crossword or word search puzzles, origami and coloring books. This creates a space where students laugh, talk and connect, she said, so that when it's time to wrap up, they are ready for learning.\n\nHolbert also emphasized that motivation ebbs and flows for students just as it does for adults.\n\n\u201cI think it's OK if sometimes kids aren't motivated or sometimes kids aren't feeling joyful. I think the systems that we find ourselves embedded in and existing in are sometimes really unpleasant,\u201d said Holbert. \u201cThe kids aren't broken, it\u2019s systems that are.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he emphasizes the importance of taking a holistic approach to thinking about how to build schools and communities to be places that value young people and care for their well-being, not just their academic achievement.",

A national survey from Nemours Children\u2019s Health found that over 80% of early elementary teachers are concerned about their students' literacy skills, with many respondents saying they don't feel prepared to tackle the reading crisis.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn an effort to improve the reading proficiency of New York's students, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a 'Back to Basics' reading plan in January 2024. The goal is to make sure students across all districts learn foundational reading skills through new and improved curriculum grounded in the science of reading.\n\nThe plan specifies that all school districts must certify that their curriculum, teaching methods and training align with evidence-based instruction to the New York State Department of Education by September 2025.\n\nAccording to the SUNY New Paltz report, 69% of schools and districts have either adopted or are piloting curriculum aligned with science of reading instructional practices.\n\nMost educators reported they are \u201cvery familiar\u201d or \u201cfamiliar\u201d \u2014 46% and 38% respectively \u2014 with the science of reading. However, only 8% of respondents stated that they received prior instruction on science of reading informed teaching practices in their educator preparation program.\n\nDespite this, teachers are working hard to gain more understanding of the topic: 75% reported being \u201cvery interested\u201d and 21% were \u201csomewhat interested\u201d in learning more about the science of reading. Most educators also said in the report that they primarily seek learning opportunities to \u201cunderstand how to teach reading more effectively\u201d and to \u201cmeet [their] students\u2019 varying needs for reading.\u201d\n\nTo implement the science of reading practices, teachers require focused and thorough professional development, the report said. This professional learning, however, needs to go beyond teaching new curriculum and ensure that educators learn about certain practices like how to screen and assess student skills, determine specific needs and select proven instructional materials.\n\nWhile 45% of educators reported learning about the science of reading from their schools and districts, many are seeking additional information from outside sources such as books, journals or magazines. Others are talking with friends and colleagues or learning from local colleges or universities.\n\nRose Else-Mitchell, executive director of the Science of Reading Center, said administrators have the power to implement an aligned system and connect educators with evidence-based curricula, as well as assessments that support and complement it. The report also recommends that school leaders rethink and expand professional learning and work on creating a strong professional learning community.\n\nAlthough the survey was sent to educators and administrators, respondents were mainly educators. The Science of Reading Center plans to establish this as an annual survey, and it will also release a slightly different administrator-specific survey next year, said Else-Mitchell.\n\n\u201cIt'll be interesting to be able to look at this year over year and see what kind of changes, because we know that nothing in education is ever a flick of a switch,\u201d she said. \u201cBut something as significant as this, which is sort of re-establishing a shared understanding and a shared evidence base for how to teach reading, will take time as it becomes more systematized.\u201d",

This plan mandates that all school districts certify their curriculum, teaching methods, and training align with evidence-based instruction by September 2025, specifically through the science of reading approach.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Over 90% of New York educators support science of reading instruction.\n* Over 80% of early elementary teachers are concerned about their students' literacy skills.\n* 69% of schools and districts have adopted or are piloting science of reading aligned curriculum.\n* Only 8% of educators received prior instruction on science of reading in their preparation programs.\n* 75% of teachers reported being \u201cvery interested\u201d in learning more about the science of reading.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* **Science of Reading Center at State University of New York New Paltz:** Conducted a survey on New York educators' views on reading instruction.\n* **Nemours Children\u2019s Health:** Conducted a national survey on early elementary teachers' concerns about student literacy.\n* **Gov. Kathy Hochul:** Announced New York's 'Back to Basics' reading plan to improve student reading proficiency.\n* **New York State Department of Education:** Will receive district certifications on curriculum alignment by September 2025.\n* **Rose Else-Mitchell:** Executive director of the Science of Reading Center; commented on implementation and future surveys.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* New York school districts must certify curriculum alignment with the Department of Education by September 2025.\n* The Science of Reading Center plans an annual survey and an administrator-specific survey next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New York's reading reform hinges on addressing educator training gaps.",

The group of Democratic officials said it believed it was \u201ccritical to rebut [the prior letter\u2019s] assertions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the SEC and DOL to uphold their commitment to protecting the ability of fiduciaries to exercise their professional judgment in assessing long-term financial risks,\u201d the Feb. 19 letter said. \u201cEfforts to politicize investment management and restrict fiduciary discretion threaten the financial security of millions of retirees.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Democratic finance officials took particular issue with the Republican officials\u2019 letter relying heavily on a federal judge\u2019s ruling against American Airlines in a lawsuit over the management of its retirement plans. The Republican finance officials used U.S. District Court judge Reed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling as evidence that the incorporation of factors like ESG is being used to pursue non-pecuniary goals.\n\nThe officials included state auditors, treasurers, controllers and comptrollers from New York City, California, Illinois and 12 other states who said that such a characterization of the use of environmental, social and governance factors is \u201cincorrect and dangerously misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision in Spence v. American Airlines, which dismissed long-term financial interests as a \u2018mere pretext,\u2019 fails to reflect the fundamental reality of long-term investing,\u201d the Democratic officials wrote. \u201cFiduciaries are not speculators \u2014 they are stewards of trillions of dollars in assets that must sustain retirees for decades.\u201d\n\nOfficials from Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also signed onto the letter. They said that risks related to climate change, governance failures and systemic issues are \u201cpresent-day financial realities affecting market valuations, insurance costs, supply chains and infrastructure resilience.\"\n\nThe Republican officials had said in their Jan. 28 letter that they held \u201cserious concerns\u201d that funds were being used to advance ESG or DEI goals and asked for rulemaking to prohibit plans from using assets to \u201cadvance political or social goals.\u201d They also asked the Labor Department and SEC to issue comprehensive guidance explicitly saying that making investment decisions or proxy votes based on ESG or diversity, equity and inclusion objectives is \u201cinconsistent with fiduciary duties.\u201d\n\nConnecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell called the request a \u201cdangerous political proposal\u201d in emailed comments to ESG Dive Wednesday, while Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs went a step further, calling the approach \u201cOrwellian\u201d and \u201ca reckless attempt to put politics ahead of sound financial decision-making\u201d in comments Wednesday.\n\n\u201cForbidding investment managers from assessing real-world risks \u2014 whether they stem from supply chain disruptions, environmental instability, shifting consumer demand, or any other factor \u2014 would restrict their ability to fully analyze investment opportunities and inherently runs counter to that fiduciary responsibility,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe blue state fiduciaries warned that if utilizing ESG factors in investment decisions was banned for fiduciaries, it could cause weaker investment performance, create greater exposure to market volatility and increase financial vulnerability for retirees.\n\n\u201cAs stewards of public funds, we have a responsibility to ensure that our investments provide stable, long-term returns over periods of decades,\u201d Delaware State Treasurer Colleen Davis told ESG Dive. \u201cIt is morally reprehensible and financially negligent to play politics with the American people\u2019s retirement savings and investments.\u201d\n\nActing SEC Chair Mark Uyeda and Acting Labor Secretary Vince Micone are currently in charge of two agencies who are defending a pair of ESG-linked regulations in court. Uyeda said last week he would seek a delay in arguments in lawsuits about the SEC\u2019s climate-risk disclosure rule, indicating the agency as constructed is not inclined to defend the rule. A federal judge recently ruled in favor of the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department on its regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral benefits in the case of a tiebreaker.

        "summary": "**Headline:** State finance officials clash over ESG's role in investment decisions\n\n**Key details:**\nA coalition of 17 Democratic state finance officials sent a letter to the SEC and DOL, challenging prior anti-ESG and anti-DEI claims from Republican colleagues. The Democrats urge agencies to protect fiduciaries' ability to assess long-term financial risks, arguing that restricting their discretion threatens retirees' security. They specifically dispute the Republican officials' reliance on a federal judge's ruling against American Airlines. Democratic officials assert that climate change and governance failures are \"present-day financial realities\" affecting market valuations and supply chains.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis development intensifies the political and ideological battle over incorporating ESG and DEI factors into investment management. Democratic officials warn that banning ESG factors could lead to weaker investment performance, greater market volatility, and increased financial vulnerability for retirees. The disagreement highlights a fundamental difference in assessing risk, challenging the view that fiduciaries should be restricted from considering these factors, which could impact the future of investment policy.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Democratic-led letter directly rebuts a previous request from Republican state finance officials who urged the SEC and DOL to prohibit the use of ESG and DEI in investment plans. This ongoing debate reflects broader efforts to politicize investment management, with officials like Connecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell calling the Republican request a \"dangerous political proposal.\" Federal agencies, including the SEC and DOL, are currently defending existing ESG-linked regulations in court.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   17 Democratic state finance officials sent a letter.\n*   The Democratic letter was sent on Feb. 19.\n*   The Republican letter was sent on Jan. 28.\n*   Officials from New York City, California, Illinois, and 12 other states signed the Democratic letter.\n*   Fiduciaries are stewards of \"trillions of dollars in assets.\"\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** Federal agency receiving letters, defending its climate-risk disclosure rule in court.\n*   **Department of Labor (DOL):** Federal agency receiving letters, successfully defended its ESG tiebreaker regulation in court.\n*   **American Airlines:** Company involved in a lawsuit over retirement plan management, cited by Republican officials.\n*   **Judge Reed O\u2019Connor:** Federal judge whose ruling against American Airlines was cited by Republican finance officials.\n*   **Erick Russell:** Connecticut State Treasurer, called the Republican request a \"dangerous political proposal.\"\n*   **Michael Frerichs:** Illinois State Treasurer, labeled the Republican approach \"Orwellian\" and \"reckless.\"\n*   **Colleen Davis:** Delaware State Treasurer, stated playing politics with retirement savings is \"financially negligent.\"\n*   **Mark Uyeda:** Acting SEC Chair, is seeking a delay in arguments for the SEC\u2019s climate-risk disclosure rule.\n*   **Vince Micone:** Acting Labor Secretary, heads the agency that recently won a ruling on its ESG tiebreaker regulation.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for the outcome of Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda's request for a delay in lawsuits regarding the SEC\u2019s climate-risk disclosure rule.\n*   Future legal challenges and the potential endangerment of both the SEC's and DOL's ESG-linked regulations.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPolitical battle over ESG escalates, impacting future investment policy and retiree security.",

        "summary_text": "Senosiain is an associate and Rollins is a shareholder at Gunster. Views are the authors\u2019 own.\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act governs calls and text messages sent by businesses to consumers. One such rule is that businesses must obtain express written consent prior to sending text messages to consumers, if they are using an automated telephone dialing system or making calls using an artificial or pre-recorded voice, including the use of AI bots.\n\nThe TCPA also provides that businesses may not call or text consumers on the federal Do Not Call List unless prior express consent is given. Even basic telemarketing calls and text messages require prior express consent. Violation of the statute can trigger liability for up to $1,500 per call or text message sent.\n\nAdditionally, many states have their own version of the TCPA, deemed \u201cmini-TCPAs,\u201d that require compliance for all businesses who make calls to consumer-residents in that state, regardless of where the business is domiciled.\n\nLead generation\n\nMany companies use lead generators which gather consumer consents for multiple businesses and then provide the companies with consent and contact information for those potential consumers. Lead generators who obtain proper written consent can be a very useful tool for companies. This was generally permissible under the TCPA.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Federal Communications Commission updated its TCPA rules requiring \u201cone-to-one consent\u201d which was to become effective Jan. 27, 2025.\n\nThe one-to-one consent rule provides that if a business uses an ATDS, artificial or prerecorded voice, the business must obtain prior express consent, one seller at a time.\n\nThus, it prevents lead generators from using a single consumer\u2019s consent for multiple businesses. Additionally, the one-to-one consent rule provides that the consent must be clear and conspicuous, and the calls and texts initiated pursuant to the consent must be logically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent. This rule applies to both text messages and phone calls.\n\nOrder delayed\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2025, the FCC postponed the 2023 order by a year, until Jan. 26, 2026. Later that same day the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the 2023 Order, thus eliminating the one-to-one consent rule.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the FCC exceeded its statutory authority under the TCPA because the 2023 Order\u2019s new consent restrictions impermissibly conflict[ed] with the ordinary statutory meaning of prior express consent.\u201d\n\nNotably, the court ruled that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority at the outset, when it created the one-to-one consent rule. The court held that the 2023 Order\u2019s one-to-one prior express consent restriction impermissibly conflicted with the ordinary statutory meaning of \u201cprior express consent.\u201d Thus, the Court vacated application of the 2023 Order, and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nAs a result, it is very likely that we will see other cases challenging TCPA regulations, especially as to the consent required before making a telemarketing call or text message using an ATDS.\n\nAbundance of caution\n\nIt is unclear whether the FCC will revise its 2023 Order to comply with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision. In order to be prepared for this rule to come into effect, and in an abundance of caution, businesses who use lead generators to source potential consumers\u2019 consent should ascertain that the lead generators are obtaining individual, one-to-one consent.\n\nBusinesses should also only contact consumers who provide this consent for telemarketing that is logically and topically associated with that which the consent was provided. Further, in addition to storing consumer contact information, businesses must retain the consent forms, information as to when consent was given, and through whom. Even businesses that do not use lead generators to obtain consent should continue to review their consent practices to ensure strict compliance with the TCPA and mini-TCPAs.\n\nThe TCPA requires prior express consent, and in many cases, prior express written consent, for calls and text messages made to prospective consumers. Regardless of any changes to the TCPA, the FTSA still requires that businesses obtain prior express written consent when making unsolicited telephone calls (including sending text messages) using an automated system. And lastly, to further protect your business, the consent form should have robust terms of service, including a class action waiver.\n\nWe continue to recommend that businesses ensure compliance with the TCPA, FTSA, and any other state regulations by always obtaining express written consent prior to contacting potential consumers via calls or text messages.",

        "summary": "**Appeals Court Voids Key FCC Telemarketing Consent Rule**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently vacated the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 2023 order, which mandated \"one-to-one consent\" for businesses. This order, initially set to become effective on January 27, 2025, would have prevented lead generators from using a single consumer's consent for multiple businesses. The court ruled the FCC \"exceeded its statutory authority,\" stating the new restrictions conflicted with the ordinary statutory meaning of \"prior express consent.\" The FCC had initially postponed the order's effective date by one year, until January 26, 2026, just hours before the court's decision.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis ruling immediately eliminates the FCC's \"one-to-one consent\" rule, removing a previously anticipated stricter requirement for telemarketing. It directly challenges the regulatory effort to limit how lead generators share consumer consents across multiple businesses. The decision means companies may not face the immediate compliance burdens expected, potentially easing operations for those relying on broader consent practices. This creates significant uncertainty for the telemarketing industry, as it is \"very likely\" that other legal challenges to TCPA regulations will follow.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) governs business-to-consumer calls and text messages, generally requiring prior express written consent for automated systems. Violation of TCPA rules can incur liability of up to $1,500 per call or text message. Many companies utilize lead generators to acquire consumer consents, a practice that was generally permissible.

The order gives Vought power over independent agencies\u2019 budgets and enables him to draft \u201cperformance standards and management objectives\u201d for independent agency heads. It also prohibits agencies from taking legal positions that differ from those of Trump or Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nThe order applies to the Fed as it relates to \u201cconduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions,\u201d but the Fed board and the Federal Open Market Committee would maintain independence over monetary policy.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAgencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission \u2013 which Congress established as independent from the White House \u2013 would also be affected by the order.\n\nThe carve-out for the Fed on monetary policy \u201cseems directed toward preventing a negative market reaction to the order,\u201d said Jeff Naimon, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at law firm Orrick.\n\nThe agencies also have to employ a White House liaison, and consult regularly on policy and priorities with the OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council and the White House National Economic Council, according to the order. The OMB will \u201cadjust so-called independent agencies\u2019 apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely,\u201d according to a fact sheet that accompanied the executive order.\n\n\u201cThese regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,\u201d the order said. \u201cMoreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\u201d\n\nThe move to expand Trump\u2019s authority is the latest by an administration that\u2019s sought to concentrate power under the executive branch. It also reflects the influence of Vought, one of the architects of conservative blueprint Project 2025, and broadens his supervisory powers. In addition to leading OMB, Vought also is acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u201cFor the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people\u2019s elected President,\u201d the order continued.\n\nNaimon noted there was strong coordination between independent agencies and the White House during Trump\u2019s prior administration, but the executive order would now require that coordination.\n\nLegal challenges to the order are \u201calmost certain,\u201d Kathryn Judge, a Columbia University professor of law, said in an email.\n\nThe outcome of any litigation is less clear, however, since the judiciary has embraced a more unitary view of the executive branch and a more expansive view of executive authority, she added.\n\nThe order \u201crepresents the largest single assertion over executive power over the administrative state that I can recall, not only in my lifetime but through history,\u201d Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said in an email. \u201cSome aspects of this control represent departures from long-standing norms. Others are in apparent contravention of statute and will be challenged legally.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much of the modern independent regulatory system survives the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts at consolidation is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d Conti-Brown said, noting that the Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed skepticism of independent agencies. SCOTUS did, however, uphold the funding structure of the CFPB.\n\nBanks may welcome the development in the near term, since the Trump administration is widely expected to usher in an era of reduced regulatory burden. But \u201cthose shifts would be far less enduring than if implemented in other ways,\u201d Judge said.\n\n\u201cLonger term, the result may be a whipsaw in regulatory and supervisory expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will make it harder for banks to make operational and other decisions that are core to their business.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump Expands Executive Authority Over Independent Agencies, Impacting Fed\n\n**Key details:**\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday expanding his authority over independent agencies, including parts of the Federal Reserve. The order requires \"significant\" agency regulations to be reviewed by an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unit led by Russ Vought. Vought gains power over agency budgets and can draft performance standards for agency heads. Agencies are also prohibited from taking legal positions that differ from those of the President or Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Fed's independence over monetary policy is maintained, but its supervision and regulation of financial institutions are affected.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis order represents the \"largest single assertion over executive power over the administrative state\" in memory. The Fed's monetary policy carve-out appears aimed at preventing a negative market reaction to the order, suggesting a market sensitivity to its independence. While banks may initially welcome a reduced regulatory burden, this benefit is described as \"far less enduring.\" Longer term, this could lead to a \"whipsaw in regulatory and supervisory expectations,\" making core business decisions harder for banks, challenging a simple positive outlook on deregulation.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis move is the latest by an administration seeking to concentrate power within the executive branch. The order asserts that independent agencies currently \"exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President\" and have promulgated regulations without presidential review. Russ Vought, an architect of the conservative Project 2025 blueprint, influenced this expansion of supervisory powers.

These include cases against a Holiday Inn Express owner; the owner of a Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel in Alabama; an Illinois hog farm; a pizzeria located in Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport; a Wendy\u2019s operator based in southern Illinois; and a Lush location based in California\u2019s Bay Area.\n\nThe complaints included a range of charges, including employers\u2019 tolerance of deadnaming, misgendering, \u201couting,\u201d and harassing and invasive comments from co-workers. Multiple lawsuits alleged retaliation, with workers reporting they had been fired after coming to their supervisors with complaints about the conduct.\n\nEEOC filed the lawsuits under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which the U.S. Supreme Court determined to include employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in the landmark 2020 Bostock v.

        "summary": "**Headline:** EEOC ditches transgender discrimination suits, reversing prior enforcement stance.\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has requested dismissal of nearly all lawsuits it filed in the past year alleging discrimination against transgender workers. This action follows less than one month after Acting Chair Andrea Lucas announced a focus on \"rolling back the Biden administration\u2019s gender identity agenda.\" At least six pending lawsuits, against various businesses, were targeted for dismissal. These complaints included charges such as employers tolerating deadnaming, misgendering, \"outing,\" and harassing comments, with some alleging retaliatory firings.\n\n**Why it matters:** The EEOC's dismissals mark a significant shift from its previous enforcement posture regarding gender identity discrimination. The agency cited a President Donald Trump executive order and Office of Personnel Management guidance as reasons for the dismissals, stating continued litigation \"may be inconsistent\" with these directives. This challenges the apparent consensus established by the U.S. Supreme Court's 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. decision, which determined Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes employment discrimination based on gender identity. Equal Rights Advocates described the move as \"dereliction of EEOC\u2019s duty\" and \"selective enforcement based on political whims.\"\n\n**The big picture:** The lawsuits were originally filed by the EEOC under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court's landmark 2020 Bostock decision had solidified the inclusion of gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII protections. The recent dismissals come after Acting Chair Andrea Lucas's stated aim to \"roll back\" prior administration policies. The agency's reasoning for dismissal directly links to a Trump-era executive order concerning \"gender ideology extremism.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Nearly every lawsuit filed in the previous year alleging discrimination against a transgender worker or workers.\n*   At least six pending lawsuits subject to dismissal motions.\n*   2020: Year of the U.S. Supreme Court's Bostock v.

That amount is about 52% of the $12 million in economic development grant funding Pactiv received in 2014 from the state\u2019s Department of Commerce, which included an agreement to keep the site open and retain at least 800 jobs through Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nPactiv also agreed to drop its legal attempts to get refunds for its 2023 and 2024 property tax payments, which could have resulted in the company receiving $4.5 million. Plus, Pactiv will not bill the city of Canton for any wastewater treatment services it provided from 1964 through last month, when it sold the shuttered mill to demolition and environmental remediation company Spirtas Worldwide.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe paper mill in Canton had been in operation for more than 100 years prior to then-owner Pactiv shutting it down in 2023, according to the state of North Carolina. Blue Ridge Paper Products operated the facility since 1999, and in 2007 that company became Evergreen Packaging through a merger. Pactiv Evergreen formed in 2020 through the combination of Evergreen Packaging and Pactiv, both of which were previously acquired by Reynolds Group Holdings.\n\nAt the time of the Canton mill\u2019s closure, many people expressed surprise at Pactiv Evergreen\u2019s decision. The company made the announcement in March 2023 along with other closure and restructuring disclosures, and CEO Mike King noted a \u201cchallenging market environment\u201d for Pactiv\u2019s beverage merchandising business. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement last week that the Canton closure came as a \u201cgut punch\" to the local and state economies.\n\nUpon introducing the lawsuit in May 2024, then-Attorney General Josh Stein noted that taxpayers \u201cinvested in Pactiv Evergreen to bolster our state\u2019s economy,\u201d but Pactiv didn\u2019t hold up its end of the bargain. He said at the time that his office had tried working with Pactiv for a year to address the company\u2019s obligations, but it had \u201cbecome clear that legal action was necessary to hold Pactiv accountable.\u201d The initial lawsuit sought repayment of the full $12 million in economic incentives that Pactiv had received.\n\nThe settlement should not be viewed as an admission to wrongdoing, according to the North Carolina Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cPactiv broke its promise to the state and the people of Canton, and today\u2019s settlement holds it accountable for violating its agreement,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who was elected in November and took office last month, said of the new settlement. \u201cThis settlement will allow the people of Canton and Haywood County to immediately put millions back into rebuilding their economy after the mill\u2019s closure, and it will shield them from future litigation from Pactiv.\u201d\n\nThe candidates for state attorney general repeatedly brought up the mill issues on the campaign trail prior to November\u2019s election. Both candidates expressed a desire to hold Pactiv accountable.\n\nPactiv had filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in July 2024. But a judge denied that motion in October, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have resolved with the State of North Carolina all outstanding matters relating to the closure and sale of our former Canton mill site. We thank our employees for their contributions to our company and wish the Canton community well in this next chapter for the Town,\u201d said Pactiv Evergreen Tuesday in an emailed statement.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Pactiv\u2019s first legal battle over the Canton site.\n\nIn autumn 2023, the company reached a settlement worth more than $2 million with the U.S. EPA over Clean Air Act violations at Canton. Earlier that year, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality said the site violated water quality requirements; the company denied the allegations. In 2021 and 2022, the mill faced state air quality violations.\n\nNovolex is in the process of acquiring Pactiv Evergreen for $6.7 billion. The deal, which would take Pactiv private, is expected to close during the first half of this year.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nA federal judge ruled that the Labor Department\u2019s regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral factors as a tiebreaker does not violate the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to court documents.\n\nTexas Northern District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled in favor Friday of a Biden administration agency motion for summary judgment and found that the agency\u2019s guidance is still valid under the Loper Bright ruling issued last year, which overturned that judicial standard of deferring to agencies\u2019 interpretations of ambiguous statutes in laws .\n\nKacsmaryk initially dismissed the lawsuit brought by a number of Republican-led states in September 2023 in a ruling relying on the now-overturned Chevron doctrine . The case was heard on appeal after Chevron\u2019s demise and sent back to Kacsmaryk to determine whether the rule could stand in a post-Chevron world.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Labor Department rule in question, \u201cPrudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,\u201d was finalized in 2022 and has been in effect since January 2023. The rule was designed to overturn guidance the agency issued in 2020 under the first Trump administration that forbade fiduciaries from utilizing \u201cnon-pecuniary\u201d factors in investment decisions.\n\nThe 2022 rule was designed to overturn a \u201cchilling effect\u201d that the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department said was witnessed under the 2020 rule. The guidance revised the agency\u2019s tiebreaker standard to allow for consideration of collateral benefits like ESG in the event that two or more investments would equally serve the plan\u2019s best interests but it would be imprudent to invest in both or all options.\n\nThe DOL rule has been repeatedly challenged by a coalition of 26 Republican-led states, who argued it runs afoul of ERISA and exceeded the agency\u2019s statutory authority. However, Kacsmaryk disagreed in his Feb. 14 ruling and said such a reading of the law \u201cembodies the wooden textualism that courts should endeavor to avoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the rule, a fiduciary faced with choosing between investment options \u2014 that all equally serve the beneficiaries' financial interests \u2014 does not advance the interests of nonbeneficiaries nor act for a purpose other than their financial benefit when he chooses based on collateral factors,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cPlaintiffs' interpretation of ERISA would demand arbitrary randomness to choose between such investment options.\u201d\n\nThe Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo case \u2014 which determined the fate of the Chevron doctrine \u2014 was decided in the time between Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial dismissal of the case and when the plaintiffs and the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department argued before the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June 2024 overturned the Chevron doctrine, which previously directed courts to give agencies deference in their interpretations of ambiguous law statutes.\n\nWhile the parties had opposing views on how Chevron\u2019s demise affected the case at hand, the Fifth Circuit refused to rule on the case, but vacated the initial dismissal and asked Kacsmaryk whether the rule can be squared with ERISA or the Administrative Procedure Act in light of Loper Bright.\n\nKacsmaryk said Loper Bright \u201cdid not disturb how courts evaluate a rule under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard,\u201d in his ruling Friday. He said the overturn of the Chevron doctrine should change how courts should interpret statutes, but not how they review the reasonableness of agency decisions.\n\nThe judge said that the tiebreaker standard in the 2022 rule does not violate ERISA\u2019s duty of loyalty nor its requirement that fiduciaries act \u201csolely\u201d and for the \u201cexclusive\u201d benefit of the plan\u2019s financial interests. Kacsmaryk said ERISA defines \u201cwhose interest the fiduciary must protect\u201d and what their purpose is, but \u201csays nothing of what they may consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as a driver, duty-bound to choose the fastest route to his destination, may choose the most scenic of two routes that each bring him to his destination at the same time, so too can a fiduciary choose a preferable investment option between two that will equally satisfy his duty of loyalty,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThe coalition of Republican-led states were also joined in their lawsuit by public oilfield services company Liberty Energy, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright served as CEO at the time. The plaintiffs have previously signaled a willingness to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, but first it will return to the Fifth Circuit panel that initially heard the arguments.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration\u2019s Labor Department will handle the case. Experts have previously expressed concerns about the DOL\u2019s rule being one of the Biden administration\u2019s ESG-related regulations likely to be put on the chopping block under Trump.",

Texas Northern District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled in favor of a Biden administration agency motion for summary judgment. He found the agency\u2019s guidance valid under the Loper Bright ruling. This allows fiduciaries to consider collateral benefits like ESG if multiple investments equally serve the plan's best interests.\n\n**Why it matters:** This ruling upholds the Biden administration's 2022 Labor Department rule allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG as a tiebreaker for plan investments. It overturns the previous 2020 Trump administration guidance that prohibited using \"non-pecuniary\" factors, which the Biden administration cited created a \"chilling effect.\" This ruling challenges the consensus view held by 26 Republican-led states who argued the rule violates ERISA and exceeds agency authority, as Judge Kacsmaryk disagreed with their interpretation. Investors should note this judicial validation of ESG consideration for fiduciaries.\n\n**The big picture:** The Labor Department's 2022 rule, effective January 2023, was designed to allow fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, overturning a 2020 Trump administration rule.

        "summary_text": "Acting Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mark Uyeda\u2019s decision last week to ask the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay arguments for the agency\u2019s climate risk disclosure rule did not come as a surprise to regulatory experts in the space.\n\nWhile the change is expected to have minimal immediate impact, it sets the stage for a shift in focus for the SEC under the Trump administration.\n\nThe SEC issued its long-awaited climate-risk disclosure rule last March, nearly two years after it was first proposed \u2014 and amid over 24,000 public comments. Uyeda was one of two commissioners to vote against the rule\u2019s approval. The rule was immediately met with multiple lawsuits that were later consolidated into the Eighth Circuit. The spate of legal challenges led the agency to stay the rule\u2019s implementation in April.\n\nGiven the agency\u2019s stay and the change in administration, Tom Willman, regulatory lead for artificial intelligence sustainability platform Clarity AI, said Uyeda\u2019s decision came \u201cas no great surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nevertheless disappointing that investors will be deprived of much-needed financially material information related to climate related risks,\u201d Willman said by email Wednesday.\n\nJulie Gorte, senior vice president of sustainable investing at Impax Asset Management was more blunt in an interview: \u201cThe only person on the planet who didn't see this coming was Rip Van Winkle,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\nUyeda\u2019s recommended pullback on defending the SEC climate rule follows his prior critiques of the rule. During the hearing on the final climate rule, in the weeks after it was finalized and in his Feb. 11 statement announcing the delay request, Uyeda maintained his belief that the SEC does not have the authority to promulgate the rule or require such disclosures.\n\nJenner & Block Partner Jennifer Lee, a former assistant director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said Uyeda\u2019s position is \u201cconsistent with the new, Republican-led SEC\u2019s shift back to focusing on \u2018bread and butter\u2019 investor disclosure issues.\u201d Lee, who now represents companies and financial institutions in regulatory investigations and litigation, told ESG Dive in emailed comments Thursday that she expects that focus to include an emphasis on materiality, while looking to avoid \u201coverly prescriptive disclosure requirements for public companies.\u201d\n\nThe change in SEC posture, however, is expected to have a minimal impact for companies or investors, according to Willman and Gorte.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this is going to be extraordinarily minimal, partly because it was never enforced in the first place,\u201d Gorte said Wednesday. \u201cSo we never had better climate reporting stimulated by U.S. regulatory postures to begin with. And for U.S. companies, or for any company really, a lot of the big ones are probably still going to have to be reporting on all the same things that were in that rule because of [other jurisdictions].\u201d\n\nWillman echoed that note and said that many U.S. companies already voluntarily report climate risks due to investor demand, in addition to growing regulatory requirements both overseas in jurisdictions like the European Union, and stateside in California. New York recently reintroduced its own version of California\u2019s climate disclosure laws.\n\nAdditionally, Stephen O\u2019Day, a partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, noted the intervenors in the case could continue the rule\u2019s defense, even though the SEC\u2019s announcement indicates this iteration of the agency is not inclined to defend the rules. In the case of the climate rule, 18 states and the District of Columbia have signed on as intervenors to support the agency\u2019s rule.\n\nO\u2019Day said a similar process happened after intervenors continued the defense for enforcement actions taken by the Clinton-era administration for violations of the Clean Air Act by coal-fired plants. Ultimately, the intervenors prevailed, and the Supreme Court upheld the actions.\n\n\u201cThe proceedings pending in the Eighth Circuit involve challenges filed by multiple parties and intervenors, any of which could seek to continue defense of the SEC rules,\u201d O\u2019Day said. \u201cSo, while the court may grant the requested 45-day pause, it remains to be seen whether any such pause will result in the end of the SEC\u2019s final rules.\u201d\n\nRegardless, sustainability programs and disclosures are expected to continue.\n\n\u201cRegulatory shifts don\u2019t change the fundamental reality: physical climate risk is already priced into markets,\u201d Lukky Ahmed, CEO of climate risk data and analytics platform Climate X, said by email Wednesday. Firms have a fiduciary responsibility to continue to assess, manage and disclose climate risks to their operations, Ahmed said.\n\n\u201cIntegrating climate resilience and adaptation strategies isn\u2019t just prudent \u2014 it\u2019s essential for maintaining business performance, driving shareholder returns, and protecting communities,\" Ahmed said.\n\nDespite the shifting federal policy stance, \u201cthere is a lot of faith that the drivers of sustainability remain in place no matter who is in anyone's White House,\u201d Gorte told ESG Dive.\n\n\u201cIf we don't solve the climate crisis, there are going to be \u2026 parts of the globe that are probably uninhabitable, or where people can't work outdoors in the summer. If we don't solve the biodiversity crisis, the prospects are even worse.\u201d Gorte said. \u201cSo there are things that we have to do in order to preserve what we think of as life as we know it, and those drivers are going to remain in place.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** SEC Pauses Climate Rule Defense, Shifting Focus to Traditional Disclosure\n\n**Key details:** Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda requested the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay arguments for the agency\u2019s climate risk disclosure rule. This decision follows the SEC's stay of the rule\u2019s implementation in April due to multiple lawsuits. Uyeda has consistently argued the SEC lacks authority to issue such a rule or require these disclosures. This action is seen as consistent with a shift by the \"new, Republican-led SEC\" towards traditional investor disclosure.\n\n**Why it matters:** This signals a shift in the SEC's focus under the Trump administration towards traditional investor disclosure issues, emphasizing materiality. However, experts like Tom Willman and Julie Gorte expect the immediate impact on companies and investors to be minimal because the rule was never enforced. It also challenges the view that this SEC change will stop climate reporting, as many U.S. companies already report voluntarily due to investor demand and other global regulations. Firms also have a fiduciary responsibility to assess and disclose climate risks.\n\n**The big picture:** The SEC issued its climate-risk disclosure rule last March, nearly two years after its proposal. The rule immediately faced multiple lawsuits, which were later consolidated into the Eighth Circuit. Due to these legal challenges, the agency stayed the rule\u2019s implementation in April. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who voted against the rule, consistently believes the SEC lacks authority to promulgate it.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* SEC climate-risk disclosure rule issued last March, nearly two years after proposal.\n* Over 24,000 public comments received on the rule.\n* Mark Uyeda was one of two commissioners to vote against the rule\u2019s approval.\n* The SEC stayed the rule's implementation in April.\n* 18 states and the District of Columbia have signed on as intervenors to support the rule.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Mark Uyeda:** Acting SEC Chair who requested a delay in climate rule arguments.\n*   **Tom Willman:** Regulatory lead for Clarity AI, who found Uyeda's decision unsurprising but disappointing.\n*   **Julie Gorte:** Senior vice president at Impax Asset Management, who expects minimal impact.\n*   **Jennifer Lee:** Jenner & Block Partner, stated Uyeda's position aligns with the new SEC focus.\n*   **Stephen O\u2019Day:** Partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, noted intervenors might continue rule defense.\n*   **Lukky Ahmed:** CEO of Climate X, stated physical climate risk is already priced into markets.\n*   **Clarity AI:** AI sustainability platform whose regulatory lead commented on the SEC's decision.\n*   **Impax Asset Management:** Sustainable investing firm whose senior vice president expects minimal impact.\n*   **Jenner & Block:** Law firm where a partner commented on the SEC's shifting focus.\n*   **Smith, Gambrell & Russell:** Law firm whose partner discussed the role of intervenors in the case.\n*   **Climate X:** Climate risk data platform whose CEO commented on market pricing of climate risk.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision regarding the requested 45-day pause in arguments.\n*   Whether the requested pause will ultimately result in the end of the SEC\u2019s final rules.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** SEC pauses climate rule defense, but market and global drivers for disclosure persist.",

        "summary_text": "The politicians, provocateurs and think tanks that in the past few years have worked to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion may not appreciate the full consequences of their efforts.\n\nThey\u2019ve used a variety of tactics, in the public and private sectors, including White House executive orders; lawsuits or the threat of lawsuits; shareholder proposals; and needling on social media. They\u2019ve notched high-profile wins, most notably the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling against affirmative action and capitulation at several companies, including retailers and brands that have ended or scaled back their DEI programs.\n\nThe successful challenges, inevitably, are forcing scrutiny of DEI practices. But they also provide an opportunity to reinforce DEI goals and execution, which David Glasgow, executive director of New York University\u2019s Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, sees as a silver lining.\n\nIndeed, the victories are hardly universal. Because diversity, equity and inclusion are good for business for a variety of reasons, most companies are not abandoning DEI. So far in 2025, Target, Nike and Costco are among those that have defended at least some aspects of their policies (in Costco\u2019s case, vociferously). As the Heritage Foundation, a major DEI foe, noted in November, most Fortune 500 companies continue to publicly commit to DEI.\n\n\u201cIt is a time for companies to refine and strengthen their inclusion efforts in ways that reduce the risk in the short term \u2014 because the risk is real, and we know that \u2014 and in ways that are sustainable in the long term,\u201d said Adrienne Pulido, vice president of inclusion insights at Kantar. \u201cSo it is looking at both ends of the spectrum, in terms of being very clear about what inclusion means to their business.\u201d\n\nWhat DEI is and isn\u2019t\n\nDEI is being pilloried as discriminatory and unfair, yet these systems are designed to create a business that is neither. That is, a business where employees have a variety of backgrounds and perspectives (diversity); hiring, promotion and other actions are executed fairly (equity); and the culture is comfortable and inviting to all who work there (inclusion).\n\n\u201cUnpacking what DEI is and what inclusion is, is part of this moment we're in and part of the conversation that companies need to have about their strategies,\u201d Pulido said by video conference. \u201cWhat does DEI mean to the business itself? What does it mean to the business and to the future business? Because the demographics of the country are changing, and our research shows that inclusion as a concept, as an idea, is very popular among Americans of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\nDEI goals for most companies are more important than ever because the markets for their products and services are more diverse than they were a decade or more ago, according to Effenus Henderson, who has worked in recruiting, staffing and succession planning at companies in the U.S. and abroad since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThis attack is amplified through the use of social media and technology and psychometrics, where emotions get aroused and reinforced,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cBut fundamental to all this is that DEI is not about creating systems that are discriminatory, or about quotas, or a focus on one thing at the exclusion of others. I don't think organizations have really done that. What they have been doing is really trying to expand participation because of the growing demographic change that we're seeing.\u201d\n\nThe need to develop DEI strategies that fit with and further business strategies dictates the involvement of leadership, according to Henderson. Too often, though, they are left to the human resources department, leaving companies at risk of adopting DEI programming that is ineffective and possibly indefensible.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are able to navigate this generally are the ones where leadership has spent the time talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about reacting to the George Floyd situation or to civil rights laws or litigation. It's really, \u2018How do we integrate this as a part of the DNA of who we are as an organization?\u2019 If your organization is more performative, then they don't really understand how it helps to shape business strategy and policy.\u201d\n\nDEI should be treated like any other strategic priority, according to Tim Heneveld, country director for Pergolux in North America. With DEI under the spotlight, it\u2019s a good moment to reassess whether hiring, workplace environment, leadership and operational strategies fit with broader aims.\n\n\u201cThat means setting measurable goals, using data to track impact, and holding leadership accountable,\u201d Heneveld said by email. \u201cSome organizations are feeling pressure to scale back DEI, but I think doing so would be shortsighted. Instead, companies should refine their DEI strategies, aligning them with long-term business goals rather than reacting to what they are seeing in the media or any other outside factors. I've experienced, firsthand, workplaces can attract top talent, strengthen their teams, and improve retention.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, companies are continuing with their DEI efforts, but changing the names of their initiatives or titles of their employees, experts said.\n\nCrafting DEI initiatives and training is always a work in progress because businesses, markets and demographics evolve, according to Henderson. For many companies, that may mean avoiding those three letters of the alphabet, or the words \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d But that, too, requires some thought, he said.\n\n\u201cIs continuing to refer to it under those banners still appropriate, and if I look at renaming it, am I doing that to help enhance our appeal to the markets of the customers and employees we serve? Are we doing it as a reactive, defensive thing for a short-term issue that's hot and heavy right now?\u201d he said. \u201cGet clarity around your objectives, the alignment with your strategies, and then decide whether how you are framing it today will work for you tomorrow and the day after. At some companies, it may mean one thing, and to others it may mean something else.\u201d\n\nThe legal concerns\n\nThe list of lawsuits against DEI programs tracked by the Meltzer Center is long, and getting longer.\n\nMost of these claims invoke civil rights laws intended to end or prevent unfair hiring practices or contracts. Frequently that includes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, barring discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin; Section 1981 of the federal code barring discrimination in contracts; and the U.S. Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, according to Glasgow. The Meltzer Center advises companies to avoid DEI practices that give preference to members of certain groups and involve a tangible benefit.\n\nEvaluating whether a company\u2019s DEI programs run afoul of the latest interpretations of these codes entails enlisting attorneys or other compliance experts.\n\n\u201cThis has become a thriving legal practice area,\u201d Glasgow said.\n\nAny business strategy should always be grounded in risk mitigation, and this is just another place for companies to check, according to Henderson. Companies may learn that, to avoid risk, certain aspects of their DEI programs should change.\n\nOthers may find that they pass muster. In its proxy statement urging shareholders to vote against a proposal that could have weakened its DEI programs, Costco\u2019s board of directors made clear that the retailer regularly evaluates its \u201cpractices concerning compliance with law, including evolving Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nIn describing how Costco obeys the law and does not discriminate in hiring, promotion and other practices, the board also provided a litany of protected statuses. This is a reminder that, while civil rights statutes are being leveraged to overturn DEI practices, they nevertheless do bar discrimination for a host of reasons. Moreover, any company that does business abroad will encounter antidiscrimination law that isn\u2019t being disrupted by political activism the way it is in the U.S., Henderson said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Canada, Europe, Asia and South America, there are regulations and laws that support and value diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo backing away from DEI may, in fact, create harm for your business strategies in other parts of the world. It's not a simple answer, and it just depends on who you are.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem like DEI programs are quickly getting scrapped in order to avoid controversy, most are simply under review, Glasgow and others said.\n\n\u201cI think it's prompting a much deeper reflection within companies, not just on what is strictly legal or illegal in what we're doing, but on what has been working and what has not been working,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cCould we be doing this work more effectively, in a way that actually helps us achieve our business goals, or helps us create the kind of culture that we want to create? Are there things that have been low impact, or maybe even have a negative impact, that we should get rid of, even if it's not for legal reasons? I think the moment that we're living in now could be a helpful reset moment for the field.\u201d",

Some companies, including Target, Nike, and Costco, have defended their policies, while others are refining strategies or renaming initiatives.

Further, she asserted, it would make the CFPB\u2019s Consumer Response database \u201cunavailable and/or unreliable, severely hamper \u2014 if not entirely take down \u2014 the Bureau\u2019s website, and likely result in the loss of mandatory public reporting the Bureau has previously done.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s order may represent a relief to CFPB employees, but it doesn\u2019t apply to bureau employees who have already been terminated. The agency last Tuesday terminated roughly 70 probationary employees, then Thursday fired another 70 to 100 term employees \u2013 those whose contracts have set limits between one and four years.\n\nAltogether, last week\u2019s firings cut roughly 10% of the CFPB's workforce, according to American Banker.\n\nThe CFPB was not the only banking regulator to see workforce reductions last week. Roughly 500 employees at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or about 8% of its workforce, accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration, Bloomberg Law reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the agency.\n\nThe FDIC then terminated probationary employees, the outlet reported Monday, though the number of employees affected remained unclear.\n\nAn FDIC spokesperson on Friday did not detail how deeply certain units of the regulator were affected.\n\n\u2018Fait accompli\u2019\n\nA lawyer representing the CFPB workers\u2019 union laid out the urgency of Friday\u2019s court action.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m asking that they don't fire the entire agency tonight,\u201d Deepak Gupta, a founding principal at Gupta Wessler, told the court, according to American Banker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the courthouse without some assurance that the mass layoff is not going to happen and then become a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 union asked Thursday for a temporary restraining order to stop the firings, but agreed to seek a preliminary injunction instead.\n\nThat mirrors a case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in which the city of Baltimore sued the CFPB, claiming Vought\u2019s move to return the agency\u2019s funding to the Fed would effectively shut down the bureau \u201cby fiat.\u201d\n\nThe government agreed Thursday that Vought would refrain from transferring money out of the CFPB\u2019s reserve fund or returning money to the Fed or Treasury until Feb. 28, or upon a \u201ccontrary order\u201d from the court, Bloomberg Law reported.\n\nStill, in the workers\u2019 union case, Brad Rosenberg, a Justice Department special counsel, objected to the request for a preliminary injunction.\n\n\"We don't think any preliminary relief is appropriate at this stage because we don't think the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits,\" he said, according to American Banker.\n\nAmong the employees the CFPB terminated Thursday is Julia Barnard, who served as the agency\u2019s student loan ombudsman since last February. Her position is mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\u201cThis work matters,\u201d Barnard said in a statement issued by the Student Borrower Protection Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for borrowers and a safeguard against a system that too often fails them. Dismantling this function is unconscionable and will cost real people real money.\u201d\n\nDelaying any further moves to slash the CFPB workforce would at least give employees time to plan and budget for their personal futures. Employees of the agency are entitled by law to 60 days\u2019 notice of job loss. But last week\u2019s firings came with no notice and with immediate effect.\n\nFurther, terminations for cause (probationary employees, for example, were notified that they were deemed \u201cnot fit for continued employment because [their] ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs\u201d) left those employees without access to severance, one lawyer with the CFPB told ABC News.\n\nIn Vought\u2019s first week as the CFPB\u2019s acting director, the bureau\u2019s headquarters were closed to employees, who were ordered to stop all bureau work. A tip line was also set up for people to report on employees who might be conducting work.",

The bureau responded by placing all employees on administrative leave, except those specifically called back. The judge also forbade the CFPB from deleting agency data or records. Furthermore, the court blocked transfers of money from the bureau's reserve funds back to the Federal Reserve. These orders followed concerns over potential mass firings and critical data loss.\n\n**Why it matters:** The judicial orders aim to preserve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's operational capacity, data integrity, and financial resources. Loss of data could impair the Bureau's ability to identify risks and respond to emerging threats, potentially destabilizing markets. This could allow bad actors to exploit weaknesses, undermine public trust, and lead to market manipulation. Tech companies could gain illegal competitive advantages, threatening market integrity and leaving consumers without recourse. This challenges the assumption of a stable, well-regulated financial environment and a fully functional consumer protection agency.\n\n**The big picture:** These court actions stem from concerns about actions taken by CFPB's acting director, Russ Vought, regarding the agency's operations. Last week, approximately 10% of the CFPB's workforce had already been terminated without notice. The National Treasury Employees Union urgently sought court intervention to prevent a potential \"mass firing\" of 95% of the bureau's employees. Additionally, a former chief technologist warned that 12 years of critical agency data were at risk of being \"irretrievably lost.\" These events occur amidst broader workforce reductions at other banking regulators like the FDIC.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   95%: Estimated percentage of CFPB workforce the union feared would be mass-fired.\n*   10%: Roughly 10% of the CFPB's workforce was cut last week.\n*   12 years: Worth of information held in agency databases at risk of deletion.\n*   March 3: Date of the next court hearing on employee terminations.\n*   8%: Approximate workforce reduction at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

        "summary_text": "The National Labor Relations Board has accused Wells Fargo of illegally threatening and retaliating against employees and coercing workers to prevent fair unionization votes at a California branch.\n\nMost employees of an Atwater, California, branch who signed cards supporting unionization in December 2023 voted against unionization the following month, a regional director of the NLRB alleged, in a complaint filed Feb. 11 and seen by Bloomberg,\n\nThe NLRB claims Wells Fargo coerced workers to vote against unionization. Wells Fargo has denied that allegation.\n\nThe labor board wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union despite the vote, based on a 2023 precedent case. The 2023 Cemex ruling strengthened the NLRB's power to compel companies that violate labor laws to recognize unions.\n\nHowever, Republicans and business groups oppose the precedent. The acting general counsel of NLRB, William Cowen, or his permanent replacement, could withdraw, amend, or settle the Wells Fargo complaint.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Cowen acting general counsel this month, days after firing NLRB\u2019s previous chief lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo, a Biden appointee, and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox.\n\nThe email notifying Wilcox of her termination said she was being fired since she did not \u201cshare the objectives\u201d of the present administration. Wilcox\u2019s ouster has left the board with only two members coupled with existing vacancies and does not meet the minimum number of members needed to adjudicate routine cases.\n\nWilcox is suing Trump, alleging the president surpassed his authority in firing her and requesting that she be allowed to resume her work as an NLRB member.\n\nThe NLRB complaint does not signify a complete investigation or a full adjudication of the allegations; rather, the regional office found that the allegations may be sufficient to go to a hearing to consider all evidence and make credibility determinations, a Wells Fargo spokesperson noted.\n\nEmployees at the Atwater branch voted 3-1 to reject unionization in January 2024. The branch manager allegedly told staff she knew about organizing discussions and warned about camera surveillance. She also reportedly told workers that Wells Fargo would apply stricter work conditions and would make union supporters stay longer hours.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank trains its managers to respect the rights of its employees to freely associate and join or support a union, or to bargain collectively with a representative of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWe train our managers to comply with labor law and respect the rights of our employees,\u201d the spokesperson told Banking Dive via email. \u201cIn this case, the majority of eligible employees freely voted against a union in a Board supervised secret ballot election and the facts do not support allegations to the contrary.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo is cooperating with the investigation but believes these allegations are unfounded and plans to defend the company and employees, the spokesperson added.\n\nAn NLRB hearing before a judge is scheduled for October, and Wells Fargo, if ordered to collectively bargain, can appeal to NLRB members in Washington, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRecently, unionized Wells Fargo employees hit a new challenge in organizing. The bank's conduct management intake team won its union vote 21-16 in December, making it the first non-branch unit at Wells Fargo to unionize.\n\nThe team, which handles customer and employee complaints across various locations, has now filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB through Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA. The complaint alleges that the bank illegally refuses to engage in collective bargaining following the certified union vote, American Banker reported. However, the bank contends it\u2019s waiting for the outcome of the NLRB\u2019s review and claims there were procedural flaws in the handling of the vote.\n\nCWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year, with around 200 employees being organized.\n\nWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf pushed back on employee unionization efforts last April, saying it\u2019s important to \u201cmake clear that we continue to believe that our employees are best served by working directly with Wells Fargo and our leadership team.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** NLRB Targets Wells Fargo Over Alleged Union Busting, Seeks Recognition\n\n**Key details:** The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has accused Wells Fargo of illegally threatening and retaliating against employees to prevent fair unionization votes. This stems from an Atwater, California, branch where employees voted against unionization in January 2024, despite many signing union support cards prior. The NLRB, leveraging a 2023 precedent, seeks to compel Wells Fargo to recognize and negotiate with the union regardless of the vote outcome. Wells Fargo denies the allegations, stating it trains managers to respect employees' labor rights and believes the claims are unfounded.\n\n**Why it matters:** This situation challenges the traditional view of labor disputes, as the NLRB is pushing for union recognition despite a formal employee vote against it. This action leverages the NLRB's strengthened powers from the 2023 Cemex ruling, which allows it to compel recognition if labor law violations occur. Republicans and business groups oppose this precedent, signaling a contentious legal battle over corporate labor practices. Recent leadership changes at the NLRB, including firings and a lawsuit, further complicate the agency's ability to adjudicate cases.\n\n**The big picture:** The NLRB has increased its power to compel companies to recognize unions, as demonstrated by the 2023 Cemex ruling. This complaint against Wells Fargo is part of a broader trend, following other recent unionization efforts within the bank, including its first non-branch unit successfully unionizing. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) organized 24 Wells Fargo branches and approximately 200 employees last year. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has previously stated that employees are best served by working directly with the bank's leadership.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   NLRB complaint filed Feb. 11.\n*   Atwater branch vote: 3-1 against unionization in January 2024.\n*   Conduct management intake team vote: 21-16 for unionization in December.\n*   CWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year.\n*   Approximately 200 employees organized by CWA.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):** Accused Wells Fargo of illegal labor practices, seeks union recognition despite a vote.\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Accused of illegal labor practices; denies allegations and plans to defend the company.\n*   **William Cowen:** Acting general counsel of NLRB, appointed by President Donald Trump this month.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Appointed Cowen and fired previous NLRB chief lawyer and a Democratic board member.\n*   **Jennifer Abruzzo:** Biden-appointee, former NLRB chief lawyer fired by President Donald Trump this month.\n*   **Gwynne Wilcox:** Democratic NLRB member fired by Trump, now suing for alleged overreach.\n*   **Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA:** Filed unfair labor practice charge over bank's refusal to bargain.\n*   **Communications Workers of America (CWA):** Unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches and ~200 employees last year.\n*   **Charlie Scharf:** Wells Fargo CEO, pushed back on employee unionization efforts in April.\n*   **Cemex:** Case strengthened NLRB's power to compel union recognition in 2023.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The NLRB hearing regarding the Atwater branch is scheduled for October.\n*   The outcome of the NLRB\u2019s review concerning the conduct management intake team's union vote.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Wells Fargo's union fight escalates; NLRB seeks forced recognition.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nChipmaker Qualcomm saw its fiscal third quarter revenue grow 10% to $10.4 billion over last year, driven in part by expansions into emerging markets, such as artificial intelligence-backed personal computers and smart glasses.\n\nto $10.4 billion The San Diego-based company reported 23% growth in its automotive and internet-connected segments, accounting for nearly $2.7 billion in revenue, as well as ongoing strength in chipset sales for smartphones. Net income grew 25% to $2.7 billion in the quarter versus last year.\n\nQualcomm is also making progress with its expansion into data center chips following its agreement last month to buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion . During an earnings call July 30 , CEO Cristiano Amon said he is already in talks with potential customers and expects to see data center revenues by fiscal year 2028.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nQualcomm, a maker of Snapdragon processors used in smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices, has been focused on diversifying its products to better accommodate the AI boom and reduce its reliance on the smartphone market.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s acquisition of Alphawave Semi, set to close in calendar year Q1 2026, aligns with that strategy, Amon said. It would provide Qualcomm with Alphawave\u2019s intellectual property and data center design capabilities, bolstering the chipmaker\u2019s high-speed wire connectivity and compute silicon solutions.\n\n\u201cWhile we are in the early stages of this expansion, we are engaged with multiple potential customers and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler,\u201d Amon said. In May, Qualcomm signed a memorandum of understanding with Humain to develop AI data centers in Saudi Arabia. It has also made its Oryon processors compatible with Nvidia technology for data center applications.\n\nIn addition to meeting data center demand, it\u2019s betting on smart glasses and wearable technology to reshape the consumer electronics landscape. As AI continues to advance, Amon said these devices are transitioning beyond simply extensions of smartphones into new and unique experiences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about the trends we see in this area with major AI players, application developers and device makers investing in this space,\u201d Amon said.\n\nQualcomm is already a major chipset supplier for Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which recently expanded into Oakley and Ray-Ban styles. It also has a partnership with China\u2019s Xiaomi, which launched its AI glasses in the quarter.\n\nBeyond wearables, Qualcomm is also seeing traction with its automotive business, driven by its digital chassis solutions, as well as industrial demand, Amon said.\n\nThe chipmaker has been taking steps to prepare for when Apple, one of its largest customers, stops buying its products altogether. Apple debuted its first modem chip with the launch of its iPhone 16e in February. In a disclosure to investors, Qualcomm said it expects Apple to increasingly use its own modem products, which could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on its earnings moving forward.\n\nDespite lower activity from Apple, Amon said the company expects handset revenues to grow 5% from Q3 to Q4.\n\nDuring the three months that ended June 29, Qualcomm saw the vast majority of its revenue come from the sale of chips and hardware. Approximately $6.3 billion stemmed from processors and chips for mobile handsets. Meanwhile, $984 million came from the company\u2019s growing automotive segment and $1.7 billion from its smart devices unit, which includes products sold for PCs, tablets, smart glasses and augmented reality headsets.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s licensing business generated nearly $1.5 billion in revenue.\n\nLooking ahead, the chipmaker is forecasting Q4 revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion.\n\nDuring the call, analysts questioned whether Qualcomm\u2019s growth in the quarter came in part from pull-in sales related to China amid tariff uncertainty.\n\nAmon assured them that \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing any evidence of pull-in,\u201d attributing the upside to early orders ahead of its new chip product launch in September.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBoeing continues to recover as the company\u2019s second quarter revenue surged approximately 35% year-over-year to roughly $22.7 billion, reflecting higher commercial plane delivery volume, according to an earnings release Tuesday.\n\nNet losses for the quarter dropped nearly 58% to $612 million, compared to $1.4 billion YoY. Additionally, the plane manufacturer has rebounded financially in the first half of the year, with revenue for the first six months increasing 26.4% to $42.3 billion compared to the same period last year.\n\nCommercial plane deliveries from H1 have also surpassed distribution numbers YoY. Boeing delivered 280 aircraft, making it the most deliveries in Q2 and the first six months of the year since 2018, President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said during an earnings call Tuesday. The company delivered 194 commercial planes in the second quarter and 378 commercial units in the first six months of 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear our recovery plan is taking hold,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re making steady progress to stabilize our business, strengthen development program execution and change our culture to set up for the future.\u201d\n\nStabilizing to increase commercial plane production\n\nEarlier this month, the National Transportation Safety Board released its final report, which found that the plane maker failed to provide \u201cadequate training, guidance and oversight\u201d to its factory workers, leading to the mid-exit door plug on Alaska Airlines that blew out midair on Jan. 5, 2024.\n\nThe incident led the Federal Aviation Administration to cap Boeing\u2019s 737 production at 38 planes a month. Since last year\u2019s Alaska Airlines incident, Boeing has spent billions of dollars to fix its production woes and the company is seeing the benefits of its ongoing investments in stabilizing its production system, Ortberg said. The company has been using key product indicators to measure the stability of its production system, which are part of Boeing\u2019s safety and quality improvement plan it submitted to the FAA last year. The manufacturer progressively increased 737 production over the past year, finally reaching 38 units per month in Q2.\n\nOrtberg highlighted Boeing\u2019s recent actions to improve its processes, including reducing traveled work by 50% and addressing employee feedback from its safety and quality standdowns, the CEO added. Additionally, Boeing engaged in structured on-the-job training as well as \u201csimplified\u201d 1,500 work instruction documents. Moreover, the company aims to shut down its shadow factory in Q3.\n\nThe plane manufacturer has also implemented KPIs for its other commercial aircraft in an effort to stabilize operations and increase production rates. The KPIs are being used at Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner facility in Charleston, South Carolina, where the production rate is seven units per month, Brian West said during his last call as the company\u2019s CFO and finance EVP. Boeing announced last year that it\u2019s investing $1 billion to expand and upgrade two 787 Dreamliner campuses in North Charleston, South Carolina, as it aims to ramp up manufacturing to 10 planes a month by 2026.\n\n\u201cThis is critical to our performance to deliver safe and high-quality aircraft on time to our customers and steadily execute our planned production increases,\u201d Ortberg said.\n\nBoeing named Stephen Parker as president and CEO of its Defense, Space & Security business on July 1, effective immediately. Parker has served as interim leader of the Boeing business unit since September 2024. Courtesy of Boeing\n\nBoeing anticipates being in a position to request approval from the FAA to increase production to 42 aircraft per month in the coming months. Despite the \u201cgood progress,\u201d the company still has a lot of work to do, Ortberg said.\n\nBoeing also made executive changes recently. West will become a senior advisor to Ortberg, with Jesus \u201cJay\u201d Malave, former CFO of Lockheed Martin, succeeding him, effective Aug.15. Boeing also named Stephen Parker as president and CEO of its Defense, Space, and Security business, effective immediately. Parker served as the segment\u2019s interim head since Ted Colbert left the company in September 2024.\n\nMitigating tariffs\n\nThe company expects to incur less than $500 million in tariff impacts, Ortberg said. While Boeing\u2019s finances are on the upswing, the recovery could be impacted by tariffs if deals are not reached by the Aug. 1 and 12 deadlines, according to a securities filing.\n\nApproximately 80% of its commercial supply chain spending is allocated to suppliers in the United States, and around 80% of its commercial deliveries are made to customers outside the U.S., Ortberg said.\n\nNevertheless, the company is encouraged by some of the bilateral trade agreements recently announced, including the U.S. deal with the European Union, West said. The two countries agreed to zero-for-zero tariffs on \u201ca number of strategic products,\u201d including aircraft and component parts.\n\nAnother relevant deal is the U.S. agreement with Japan, as one of Boeing\u2019s key areas is the equipment the company imports from Japan. The pact includes provisions for increased U.S. energy and aerospace exports. Additionally, the White House stated that Japan is expected to purchase 100 Boeing aircraft.\n\nHowever, Boeing is monitoring the trade environment, particularly with Canada, Mexico and Italy concerning its suppliers. The company is also closely tracking negotiations with China, as the country is a significant market for Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile the U.S. and China reached an agreement last month, the deal has yet to be finalized. Still, Ortberg doesn\u2019t expect to see additional tariffs going forward.\n\n\u201cAs a leading U.S. exporter, ongoing free trade is important to our business,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cOur top priority is promoting continuity of supply, and we\u2019re working across the supply chain to ensure suppliers are focused on meeting the strong market demand.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of IAM District 837 during negotiations with Boeing in June. The 3,200 machinists who work at the company's fighter jet facilities in Missouri and Illinois voted to reject Boeing's most recent offer on July 27. Courtesy of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers\n\nAnother pending strike on the defense side\n\nBoeing may face another workers\u2019 strike later this month, this time at its fighter jet facilities in St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri; and Mascoutah, Illinois.\n\nBoeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 initially reached a tentative agreement last week in which the labor union voted to reject the offer, according to the machinists website.\n\nThe current contract expired July 28 and is followed by a seven-day cooling-off period before a strike would begin Aug. 4. Boeing and IAM District 837 resumed negotiations on Thursday and the company proposed its \u201clast, best and final offer\u201d that withdrew alternative workweek schedules, added a reward for good attendance at $0.50 an hour, and a $5,000 bonus if the contract is ratified by the end of Sunday. If the union votes to reject the offer, Boeing said it'll withdraw the $5,000 ratification bonus.\n\nIAM District 837 will vote on Boeing\u2019s modified offer on Sunday. If the union votes to reject the proposal, a strike will begin the following day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve activated our contingency plan and are focused on preparing for a strike,\u201d Boeing said in a July 27 statement.\n\nOrtberg said that if a strike occurs at its Missouri and Illinois facilities, the company will manage through it, since the employee numbers there are significantly smaller than at its Washington and Oregon sites.\n\nThe company experienced a nearly two-month work stoppage last year due to 33,000 IAM District 751 and W24 workers striking at the company\u2019s commercial aircraft facilities on the West Coast, contributing to a significant loss of $11.8 billion in 2024.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Boeing's Recovery Accelerates Amid Soaring Revenue and Production Growth\n\n**Key details:**\nBoeing reported a 35% surge in Q2 revenue to $22.7 billion, with net losses dropping 58% to $612 million year-over-year. First-half revenue increased 26.4% to $42.3 billion, driven by 280 commercial aircraft deliveries, the most since 2018. The company reached a 737 production rate of 38 units per month in Q2 and plans to request FAA approval to increase this to 42 units monthly. Boeing expects less than $500 million in tariff impacts and aims to shut down its shadow factory in Q3. Executive changes include Jesus \u201cJay\u201d Malave as the new CFO and Stephen Parker leading Defense, Space & Security.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBoeing's improved financial results and increased production rates indicate its recovery plan is taking hold, with investments in stabilizing its production system yielding benefits. This progress is crucial for the company to deliver safe, high-quality aircraft on time and execute planned production increases. It challenges a consensus view that persistent quality and manufacturing issues would continue to severely hinder Boeing's financial performance, as the company is making tangible strides. The increase in deliveries and revenue, despite past incidents and regulatory caps, suggests a strengthening operational foundation.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBoeing has been recovering from significant challenges, including the January 2024 Alaska Airlines mid-air incident, which led to an FAA 737 production cap. The company has invested billions to address production issues and improve its safety and quality. Additionally, Boeing faced a nearly two-month work stoppage last year by IAM District 751 and W24 workers, contributing to an $11.8 billion loss in 2024. The company is also navigating tariff concerns, with key deadlines approaching, and a potential strike from IAM District 837 at its defense facilities.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 Revenue: ~$22.7 billion, up ~35% year-over-year.\n*   Q2 Net Losses: Dropped nearly 58% to $612 million.\n*   H1 Commercial Deliveries: 280 aircraft, highest since 2018.\n*   737 Production Rate: Reached 38 units per month in Q2.\n*   Expected Tariff Impacts: Less than $500 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Boeing:** The aerospace company undergoing financial recovery and production stabilization efforts.\n*   **Kelly Ortberg:** President and CEO, stating Boeing's recovery plan is taking hold.\n*   **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA):** Regulator that capped Boeing's 737 production due to safety concerns.\n*   **Jesus \u201cJay\u201d Malave:** Incoming CFO effective Aug. 15, succeeding Brian West.\n*   **International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837:** Union potentially striking Boeing's fighter jet facilities.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   IAM District 837 will vote on Boeing's modified contract offer on Sunday.\n*   Tariff impact deadlines are set for August 1 and August 12.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nBoeing sees financial recovery despite looming labor and trade issues.",

Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nManufacturing in the United States isn\u2019t romantic.\n\nDespite what glossy ads, political speeches and tech expos suggest \u2014 gleaming robots, spotless factories and the promise of bringing jobs back home \u2014 the reality is more brutal.\n\nI\u2019ve learned it\u2019s steel-toed boots, long hours and being measured by your last shift, your last run, your last screw-up. And for those who stay it\u2019s also about pride, grit and mastery. But none of it comes easily.\n\nAs the country talks about reviving American industry, the real question is whether our workforce \u2014 and our expectations \u2014 are ready for what that truly demands. These are some of my lessons from decades on the job.\n\nThe entry point is hard, fast and underpaid\n\nMost people don't \"choose\" manufacturing; they land in it. Sometimes from a technical school. Often from circumstance. You get your foot in the door \u2014 running a filler, packing pallets, loading raw materials \u2014 and you realize quickly that no one's waiting to hand you anything.\n\nThe work is physical. The pay at the beginning is barely enough. Maybe $18 an hour, if you're lucky. Maybe rotating 12-hour shifts with no childcare. The benefits vary widely \u2014 union shops can be solid; non-union ones often tread the fine line between acceptable and exploitative.\n\nAnd the unspoken reality is you may experience injuries, repetitive stress, line fatigue and night shifts that screw up your sleep for years.\n\nThe climb has no map, few guides\n\nMoving up in manufacturing requires more than hustle. It takes visibility, timing and often politics.\n\nThe best operators don't always become supervisors. The best supervisors don't always get promoted. And there's usually no clear pathway \u2014 just a mix of luck, attrition and whoever happens to be watching.\n\nMiddle management? That's where careers either advance or stall. You're stuck between the C-suite's cost obsession and the frontline's daily chaos. You make decisions no one thanks you for and get blamed for outcomes you didn't control.\n\nLeadership in manufacturing is not about glossy strategy decks. It's about walking the floor when you're exhausted, defusing conflicts with HR breathing down your neck, keeping lines running when half the crew calls out and still hitting a margin target that was set by someone who's never touched a valve or heard a piston seize.\n\nThe culture is a mixed bag\n\nThe culture varies. Some plants are toxic: blame-heavy, turf-driven, unsafe. Others are tight-knit, even familial, where veterans look out for rookies and you solve problems with duct tape and a handshake.\n\nBut make no mistake: ego, burnout and generational divides are everywhere. The old guard resents the new hires. The latest hires roll their eyes at \"the way we've always done it.\" HR often spends more time rolling out diversity initiatives than addressing the real, unresolved safety issues on the third shift, where the newest, least experienced workers face the highest risks.\n\nAnd most outsiders \u2014 executives, consultants and media \u2014 don\u2019t understand what it takes to build something, fix something, or keep it running continuously 24/7 without failure.\n\nThe rewards are real, but earned\n\nIf you survive the grind \u2014 and learn to lead \u2014 manufacturing offers something no desk job can. You can point to something and say, \"We made that.\"\n\nYou learn systems. You learn people. You learn what it means to stand up under pressure and keep going when everything's breaking. And for some, you learn how to transform not just product, but culture \u2014 how to lead turnarounds, build teams and leave plants better than you found them.\n\nYes, the money gets better. Six figures is attainable if you transition into operations leadership, technical direction, or supply chain management. But you'll earn every penny in sleepless nights, holiday calls and constant stress.\n\nAnd still, you might get laid off after a merger and reorganized when a private equity group cuts costs or pushed out when you're \"too expensive\" after building the whole damn system.\n\nIt's either a calling, or it breaks you\n\nManufacturing, although not easy, has been a productive career for me. However, are we willing to invest in what it takes to make that the case for everyone?\n\nManufacturing will harden you, humble you, and \u2014 if you let it \u2014 shape you into something fierce and capable. But it\u2019s not for the faint of heart or the glory-seeker.\n\nIt\u2019s for those who believe in execution over excuses, in teams over titles and in building things that matter \u2014 even when no one\u2019s looking.\n\nSo, what\u2019s it like to build a career in U.S. manufacturing? It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s real work.\n\nAs the country rallies around the idea of bringing manufacturing back home, we need to ask: Is this truly what we want? And if so, are we prepared to invest in the education, training and cultural readiness it demands?",

Entry-level pay is low, around $18 an hour, with physical demands and varying benefits, often including injuries. Career progression lacks a clear path, and middle management faces immense pressure from both C-suite cost obsession and frontline chaos. The culture varies, but common issues include ego, burnout, and generational divides, with safety concerns often overlooked. Financial rewards are attainable in leadership roles, but demand significant personal cost and carry risks like layoffs or reorganization.\n\n**Why it matters:** This article challenges the romanticized view of U.S. manufacturing often presented by ads, political speeches, and tech expos. It highlights a brutal reality of physical work, low entry pay, and unclear career paths, contrasting with images of gleaming robots and easy job creation. For investors, this perspective suggests that current discussions about reviving American industry may overlook the deep-seated challenges in workforce readiness, retention, and conditions. The author questions whether the country is prepared to invest in the education, training, and cultural readiness demanded by this reality, potentially impacting future industry growth and profitability.\n\n**The big picture:** Don Brock, a retired senior executive with over 25 years in food and consumer product manufacturing, offers a candid perspective on U.S. manufacturing. His insights come from decades on the job, contrasting with common public perceptions of the industry. The article provides background on the unromantic and often difficult realities experienced on the factory floor. This first-hand account is offered amidst ongoing national conversations about reviving American industry and bringing jobs back home.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   25+ years: Author's experience in food and consumer product manufacturing.\n*   $18 an hour: Approximate entry-level pay in manufacturing.\n*   12-hour shifts: Common length for rotating shifts.\n*   Six figures: Attainable salary for operations leadership, technical direction, or supply chain management.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Don Brock: Author and retired senior executive sharing his 25+ years of manufacturing experience.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

        "summary_text": "Campaign Trail is our analysis of some of the best new creative efforts from the marketing world. View past columns in the archives here.\n\nFor marketers to, as the conventional wisdom goes, move at the speed of culture, they need to be embedded in the dirt of social media, in touch with grassroots developments and ready to scale organizational branches. Doing so can allow ideas to bear fruit, as in the latest campaign from Miracle-Gro, which encourages consumers to embrace the idea of a \u201cFull Bush Summer.\u201d\n\nAs with almost every contemporary trend, \u201cfull bush in a bikini\u201d kicked off with a video on TikTok that now has over 17 million views. That direct, body-positive sentiment about pubic hair has since spread across social and traditional media, showing up in Vogue, Glamour and Women\u2019s Health. It also caught the eye of The Martin Agency, which serves as Miracle-Gro\u2019s creative agency of record.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't [a brief] \u2014 this was a fully proactive idea from The Martin Agency team,\u201d said Nadezhda Camperlengo, vice president at head of social at the agency. \u201cThey brought it to me, and I was like, \u2018This is bigger than one post. This is bigger than just a social moment. This is bigger than just one element.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe campaign, which will run across organic and paid social with digital banner placements, merchandise giveaways and an influencer partnership, is the type of lightning-in-a-bottle moment that marketers are always looking to capture \u2014 even when they come with possible brand safety concerns.\n\n\u201cObviously, this concept is a bit edgy, but it is really true to our roots and our brand purpose, which is encouraging growth, empowerment and self-expression through gardening,\u201d said Sadie Oldham, vice president and head of gardens at the company. \u201cWhile it was playful, the message was sincere in that Miracle-Gro supports healthy growth, however that might look to you.\u201d\n\nGrowing an ecosystem\n\nWhile the \u201cfull bush\u201d idea had a clever connection to Miracle-Gro\u2019s purpose and products, it would need to be more than just an ephemeral trend or TikTok format for the Martin Agency to craft a durable brand campaign around it. But beyond the pun, the agency found a resonant brand truth in the moment.\n\n\u201cThis is a return to natural beauty and self-expression. It's a larger cultural phenomenon\u2026 there's longevity to that,\u201d Camperlengo explained. \u201cThe conversation itself is way more than a TikTok and way more than a hashtag.\u201d\n\nCamperlengo quickly reached out to folks throughout the agency and encouraged them to embrace blue sky thinking as they generated every idea they could around the concept, knowing that Miracle-Gro has pushed the agency to be creative and embrace the uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt was truly like a writer's room type of vibe, of how we built this ecosystem as a team, but we knew that beyond TikTok, this is a human truth and experience that we wanted to hit from as many designs as possible,\u201d Camperlengo said.\n\nFor Miracle-Gro, the campaign represented a way to speak to the young consumers who are new to the gardening category and also highly engaged online.\n\n\u201cWe felt the spark. it was unexpected. It felt culturally relevant. It aligned with how our consumers are engaging\u2026 They don't take themselves too seriously. They are confident in themselves and their abilities, and they really just like to express themselves,\u201d Oldham said.\n\n\u2018Millennial Jennifer Coolidge\u2019\n\nAs with any socially inspired campaign, \u201cFull Bush Summer\u201d needed the right influencer partner to make the creative connect with consumers. The Martin Agency scored their top pick for the effort in Gabby Windey, a celebrity known for her appearances on reality and competition hits including \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had so many cultural touch points,\u201d Camperlengo said. \u201cShe's incredibly wise, but very dry, and her comedic timing is so unique, like a millennial Jennifer Coolidge.\u201d\n\nWindey is also a growing personality on TikTok and in the podcast space, and her balance of tongue-in-cheek comedy and a focus on grounded self-affirmation made her a good fit for \u201cFull Bush Summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn't want this campaign to be slapstick or crude, we wanted it to be clever and tight. She stood for those things in addition to just being herself and always standing for self-expression,\u201d Camperlengo said.\n\nAlong with Windey\u2019s content, banner placements across Amazon and other social media elements, the campaign also features baby tees emblazoned with the tagline, \"Nobody knows I'm growing a full bush rn\u201d \u2014 another example of how the effort jumps on another trend that has hit the pages of Vogue.\n\n\u201cTo be connected to culture, you need to show up in places where people experience cultures,\u201d Oldham said. \u201cWe cannot wait to continue to explore other fun and kitschy ways to surprise and delight our audiences with funny campaigns like this.\u201d",

The company helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million consumers in the U.S. through full-funnel offerings that include its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 its DSP.\n\n\u201cOur trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping, and streaming signals paired with extensive supply side relationships and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to optimize advertising, deliver greater precision, and drive efficient and effective advertising outcomes,\u201d CEO Andy Jassy said of the DSP on an earnings call.\n\nAlong with revamping the DSP user experience in October, Amazon in June integrated it with Disney\u2019s Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX), allowing advertisers to leverage insights from both companies. Amazon last month also partnered with Roku to offer advertisers using its DSP what the companies claim is the largest authenticated CTV footprint in the U.S., a partnership Jassy called \u201cmomentous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a giant leap forward for advertisers bringing best in class planning, audience precision, and performance to TV advertising,\u201d the executive said.\n\nAmazon has continued to build out its advertising ecosystem, unveiling artificial intelligence-powered contextual ads at its second annual upfront in May, partnering with InfoSum and Magnite around data and widening access to AI tools for advertisers.\n\nFor its retail business, Amazon expects Q3 net sales to be between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, a wide range that takes into consideration a macroeconomic environment that continues to be effected by President Trump\u2019s moves around tariffs. The company\u2019s guidance around operating income in Q3 was lower than analysts expected. Executives noted that it is still too early to see how tariffs will settle and who will absorb the costs.\n\n\u201cIn the first half, we just haven\u2019t seen diminished demand and we haven\u2019t seen any kind of broad scale [average sale price] increases. And, you know, so that could change in the second half. There are a lot of things that we don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Jassy said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Amazon's Ad Revenue Soars, Outpacing Retail Amidst Macro Concerns.\n\n**Key details:** Amazon's advertising revenue increased 22% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2 2025, surpassing Wall Street expectations. This ad business growth outpaced the 13% net sales increase of its core retail business. Executives highlighted developments around its demand-side platform (DSP) and a recent deal with Roku concerning connected TV (CTV). The company also signaled that Alexa+ might eventually offer advertising opportunities.\n\n**Why it matters:** Amazon's robust ad revenue growth, outpacing its retail segment, indicates a strong and diversifying revenue stream. The emphasis on DSP enhancements and the Roku CTV partnership signals an expanding advertising ecosystem. This performance challenges potential consensus views that macroeconomic pressures and tariff impacts might be broadly diminishing demand, given the ad business's continued strength. However, the company noted possible recessionary fears and lower-than-expected Q3 operating income guidance due to the macroeconomic environment.\n\n**The big picture:** Amazon's advertising business has consistently grown faster than its core retail segment, showing its increasing importance. The company leverages its extensive ad-supported audience of over 300 million U.S. consumers across platforms like Prime Video and Twitch. Amazon has been actively expanding its advertising ecosystem, integrating its DSP with Disney\u2019s Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX) and partnering with Roku for a large authenticated CTV footprint. These efforts, combined with AI tools and data partnerships, aim to optimize advertising outcomes through proprietary consumer signals.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 2025 advertising revenue: $15.7 billion\n*   Year-over-year ad revenue growth: 22%\n*   Core retail net sales: $167.7 billion\n*   Core retail net sales growth: 13%\n*   Average U.S. ad-supported audience: over 300 million consumers\n*   Q3 net sales guidance range: $174 billion to $179.5 billion\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Amazon:** Core company reporting strong Q2 2025 ad revenue and growth outperforming retail.\n*   **Roku:** Partnered with Amazon to offer advertisers the largest authenticated CTV footprint.\n*   **Andy Jassy:** Amazon CEO, spoke about DSP, Roku partnership, and macroeconomic uncertainties.\n*   **Disney:** Its Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX) integrated with Amazon's DSP.\n*   **InfoSum:** Partnered with Amazon to build out its advertising ecosystem around data.\n*   **Magnite:** Partnered with Amazon to build out its advertising ecosystem around data.\n*   **President Trump:** His tariff moves influence the macroeconomic environment for Q3 guidance.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for Amazon's Q3 2025 net sales performance and actual operating income.\n*   Observe how tariffs and recessionary fears impact demand and prices in the second half.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Amazon's ad growth defies macro concerns, emerging as a critical revenue engine.",

Campaigns and creative for brand partners are also informed by Disney's swath of consumer data and insights and can leverage commerce-driven ads.\n\nAdvertiser interest in \u201cProject Runway\u201d arrives as U.S. ad spending on connected TV is expected to grow 16.8% in 2025 to reach $33.48 billion, per eMarketer forecasts. Simultaneously, streaming continues to grow as consumers\u2019 preferred method of viewing. Streaming outpaced the combined share of broadcast and cable viewing for the first time in May, according to Nielsen.\n\nCalia by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will be featured in a \u201cProject Runway\u201d episode through a sponsored challenge where contestants on the show create a piece inspired by the athleisure brand. The winning look, made from Calia fabric, will be produced and sold at Dick\u2019s. During the same episode, contestants will also be sporting clothing from the brand.\n\nAdditionally, Calia signed on as the first brand to participate in Disney\u2019s new commerce-driven ad solution, Shop the Stream, to allow viewers to shop looks from the marketer from their screens. Commerce media and CTV have been becoming more closely aligned as marketers attempt to generate more tangible results, like foot traffic and sales, from a channel that\u2019s typically leveraged for mass reach.\n\nUlta Beauty will serve as the exclusive beauty sponsor of season 21. Integrations include a custom \u201cSalon at Ulta Beauty\u201d on set, which was used by models for hair and makeup each episode before every runway. Additionally, some episodes will include conversations between designers, models and makeup artists about Ulta Beauty services.\n\nOne episode of the series is inspired by PNC Bank\u2019s \u201cBrilliantly Boring\u201d campaign, which asserts the brand\u2019s dedication to being \u201cboring\u201d by staying steady and reliable, by tasking contestants to transform \u201cboring\u201d fabrics into something fresh. PNC and \u201cProject Runway\u201d will also run a custom 30-second spot within the episode, followed by a 10-second co-branded slate that will run once the episodes become available on streaming. Social posts will also run after the episode debuts on Freeform.\n\nPilot Pens\u2019 Pilot FriXion Erasable Pen is the exclusive writing tool for contestants, and viewers will see in-show brand integrations and placements of designers using the pen during the season. Lilly hosted a sponsored challenge that tasked contestants to create a comfortable \u201cnight on the town\u201d outfit for people with skin sensitivities, including eczema.\n\nIn a sponsored challenge, contestants were tasked to create an avant-garde look inspired by Universal Pictures\u2019 forthcoming film \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d That episode will also feature an appearance by Paul Tazewell, the Oscar-winning costume designer from the film.\n\nDisney Advertising recently completed its 2025-26 upfronts presentation, reporting that overall volume is consistent with the year prior despite sports and streaming seeing increased sales. Notably, sports advertising volume across linear and addressable is nearly $4 billion, inclusive of 69 multi-year deals and women\u2019s sports volume growth up double digits.

The brand, which is over 40 years old, is viewed as nostalgic by millennials, according to press materials.\n\nThe campaign is the brand\u2019s first big marketing push in several years and will span TV, online video, social and digital channels. It signals a messaging shift by Lunchables after moving away from its \u201cBuilt To Be Eaten\u201d brand platform in 2020.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOnce the undisputed king of pre-packed lunch products marketed to children, Lunchables has seen its dominance weaken amid increased competition. As competitors crowd grocery store shelves, Lunchables is hoping to reignite interest in the brand for kids and parents alike with what it\u2019s saying is its first far-reaching marketing push in several years.\n\nIn its Q2 2025 earnings release this week, the company pointed to declining volume for Lunchables and said it expects sluggish sales across several brands to continue throughout the year. On an earnings call, executives said the company plans to ramp up marketing spend in the second half, including by up to 75% for brands like Lunchables and Capri Sun, according to Adweek.\n\n\u201cThe Lunchables Effect\u201d was inspired by social media conversations surrounding the product. There are over 170 Reddit threads talking about how \u201ccool\u201d Lunchables are, according to press materials. Many are made by older consumers reminiscing about the role the product played during their school years. Nostalgia is a go-to marketing strategy for consumer brands looking to reach a wide audience with feel-good messaging at a time of divisiveness and economic uncertainty.\n\nVideo spots focus on the impact Lunchables can have for kids during difficult moments. In \u201cShoulders,\u201d a kid is hoisted into the air by classmates after biting into a Lunchables. In \u201cFractions,\u201d the product serves as a valuable bargaining chip during a trade.\n\n\u201cBy tapping into the way kids truly enjoy the beloved lunchtime staple, we were able to creatively show the \u2018cool effect\u2019 and reinforce the brand as a classic, bold and beloved everyday choice around back to school season,\u201d said Alyssa Cicero, senior brand manager, Lunchables, in a statement.\n\nLunchables has faced competition from Lunchly, an alternative from influencers Logan Paul, Mr. Beast and KSI. Lunchly claims to be the healthier alternative to Lunchables, boasting higher electrolyte counts, fewer calories and less sugar. However, Lunchly isn\u2019t without its controversy. The product was plagued by mold accusations.\n\nLunchables has had its own share of controversy over the years. In 2024 Kraft Heinz pulled Lunchables from U.S. schools after a nutritional controversy. Since 2018, the brand\u2019s market share has slipped to approximately 60%, a 25-point drop. Its new campaign arrives ahead of Kraft Heinz\u2019s expected spin-off of its grocery brands, including Lunchables, following a difficult few years for sales as consumer tastes change.",

The script is loaded with innuendo, but Goggins undercuts the come-ons by playing a by-the-books professional (until eating Doritos, that is).\n\nThe Frito-Lay snack maker is screening the short during a VIP influencer event at New York\u2019s Slipper Room. Digital and out-of-home ads, including Times Square placements, will try to generate additional traction for the effort, as will a broadcast channel on Instagram for sharing \u201czestier\u201d content than is allowed on Doritos\u2019 public channels.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNostalgia for vintage pop culture is nothing new in marketing. Emulating old-school porn is a different beast, however, and could raise eyebrows for Doritos\u2019s Golden Sriracha variant, which is being positioned as the Frito-Lay marketer\u2019s potential next big flavor innovation.\n\n\u201cA Spicy, but Not Too Spicy Plumber\u201d carries the hazy look and corny feel of \u201870s smut, opening on a vinyl record starting to spin on a turntable. Goggins, who is having a moment in the cultural spotlight, stars as a plumber hired to fix a blond bombshell\u2019s broken pipes. Just as their conversation is reaching a fever pitch of innuendo, Goggins ruins the moment by describing the source of the sink leak in great technical detail. The viewer is meant to understand that everyone is operating from an X-rated script but him.\n\nThe arrival of a male roommate who hears \u201cbanging\u201d does little to break the plumber out of his straight-arrow character, nor does the later appearance of a \u201ccougar\u201d drawn to sounds of moaning (over the plumber\u2019s payment plan options). Only after biting into a Golden Sriracha Dorito does Goggins\u2019 protagonist seem to recognize the genre he\u2019s in, just in time for an \u201cextra large sausage\u201d pizza, courtesy of a ridiculous-looking delivery man.\n\nThe racy creative premiered as part of an event at the Slipper Room, an iconic Lower East Side venue that is credited with helping bring neo-burlesque to New York. A 360-degree media plan supports the short, including digital, social and OOH ads, including some placed around Times Square, once the seedy home of adult theaters. Doritos is also leveraging Instagram\u2019s broadcast channel feature for content that further straddles the NSFW line.\n\nDoritos said the effort, developed with agency Rethink, was informed by Gen Z\u2019s preference for flavors that are spicy without overcranking the heat index. \u201cA Spicy, but Not Too Spicy Plumber\u201d follows that lead with humor that is \u201cplayful and suggestive\u201d without ever being explicit. Doritos Golden Sriracha, which is now sold nationwide, is part of a larger wave of food and beverage products trying to capitalize on Gen Z\u2019s love of spicy snacks.\n\n\u201cBy elevating Doritos Golden Sriracha, a globally inspired flavor that balances tanginess and sweetness with approachable heat, with a campaign that playfully subverts expectations, we hope to inspire fans to take a bite of what could be our next \u2018mega-flavor,\u2019\u201d said Tina Mahal, SVP marketing at PepsiCo Foods U.S., in a statement.\n\nWhile the over-the-top approach could court controversy, Goggins may also help bolster Doritos\u2019 appeal. The actor has achieved fresh levels of popularity thanks to roles in streaming hits like HBO Max\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cFallout.\u201d Brand deals have quickly followed, with the actor appearing in recent campaigns for companies like Walmart and GoDaddy.",

Kroger recorded $13 billion in e-commerce sales in fiscal 2024, with its digital sales up 15% year over year during its latest quarter.\n\nKroger recently announced plans to close 60 stores as it looks to tighten its belt after its proposed merger with Albertsons fell through. During its earnings call last month, Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Kroger is \u201caggressively looking for ways to reduce costs throughout the company.\u201d\n\nKroger\u2019s efforts to strengthen and streamline its marketing services come as retailers increasingly tap into retail media as an alternative revenue generator. Walmart\u2019s advertising business Walmart Connect grew 31% year over year in the U.S. during its most recent quarter.\n\nWhile Kroger has seen a rollback in CPG spending recently, the grocer\u2019s retail media business \u201ccontinues to grow at a healthy rate\u201d and is expected to continue that trajectory for the rest of the year, CFO David Kennerly told investors in June.\n\nAt the end of 2024, retail media networks were valued at $8.5 billion for U.S. grocers, with the number of retail media networks predicted to double over the following 18 months, according to a report by Grocery Doppio, a news and insights firm run by digital services company Incisiv.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Trump administration announced an initiative Wednesday that aims to boost health data sharing through partnerships with major healthcare and technology firms, including Amazon, Google, UnitedHealth and Epic.\n\nThe Health Tech Ecosystem focuses on two areas: encouraging adoption of a voluntary blueprint for data sharing called CMS Interoperability Framework and increasing the availability of digital health tools, like products for chronic disease management and care navigation, the CMS said in a press release.\n\nMore than 60 companies \u2014 including technology firms, providers, insurers and health data sharing networks \u2014 have pledged to participate in the initiative. The partnership aims to \u201cdeliver results for the American people\u201d in the first quarter next year, the CMS said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nInteroperability and information sharing is a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector, made harder by siloed data that doesn\u2019t easily flow between providers and a reliance on dated technology like fax machines.\n\nStill, the industry has seen some recent progress on health data sharing. In late 2023, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, a governance framework for information exchange, went live after years of effort.\n\nTEFCA launched with five Qualified Health Information Networks, or QHINs, and their number has since expanded to nine, including new additions like e-prescribing Surescripts\u2019 data exchange and ambulatory electronic health record vendor eClinicalWorks.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is launching its own data sharing initiative. It includes the CMS Interoperability Framework, which the agency said is a \u201ccall to action for health data networks that want to move faster.\u201d\n\nThe framework\u2019s criteria are supposed to be \u201cvisionary,\u201d the CMS said. Some of the goals include ensuring patients can access their electronic medical data anywhere on the network, using apps of their choice.\n\nPatients should also be able to access claims, explanation of benefits and prior authorizations from current and past payers, and data queries should be responded to quickly \u2014 possibly in real time, according to the CMS.\n\n\u201cFor too long, patients in this country have been burdened with a healthcare system that has not kept pace with the disruptive innovations that have transformed nearly every other sector of our economy,\u201d CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. \u201cWith the commitments made by these entrepreneurial companies today, we stand ready for a paradigm shift in the U.S. healthcare system for the benefit of patients and providers.\u201d\n\nAdvaMed, an influential medtech lobbying group, praised the initiative Wednesday. Shaye Mandle, executive director of AdvaMed\u2019s Digital Health Tech division, said the \u201cera of personalized, precision medicine is upon us,\u201d but it requires data that can be connected across the continuum of care.\n\n\u201cThe medtech industry is vital to the delivery of care and the improvement of patient outcomes, and we can do even more with additional tools,\u201d Mandle said. \u201cAccess to critical information for research and development can be a challenge for medtech innovators to obtain. Greater access would promote the personalized, precise medtech design, utilization, and care patients deserve. Shared data is paramount for clinicians, innovators, and patients.\u201d\n\nMandle also stressed the need to protect patient privacy within the interoperability of health systems and patient records.\n\nTwenty-one companies have pledged to become CMS Aligned Networks, including EHR and health IT vendors like Epic, Oracle Health and athenahealth, as well as data exchanges that have received QHIN status like CommonWell Health Alliance and eClinicalWorks.\n\nThe CMS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by press time on how the latest data sharing initiative will interact with TEFCA.\n\nAdditionally, eleven health systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Bon Secours Mercy Health and Intermountain Health, said they would participate in the networks. They pledged to accept patient information through digital tools to help \u201ckill the clipboard\u201d \u2014 or stop requiring patients to fill out medical histories on paper before visits.\n\nThirty companies, like Google, Apple and Samsung, joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology, according to the CMS.\n\nThat includes a pledge to allow patients to retrieve their health data through the network or personal apps, and then share that information with providers. Other firms signed on to use the network or apps to access health data to provide support to patients managing diabetes or obesity.",

It aims to encourage adoption of the CMS Interoperability Framework and increase the availability of digital health tools for care management. More than 60 companies, including major healthcare and technology firms, have pledged to participate. The initiative seeks to deliver results for the American people in the first quarter next year. Goals include enabling patients to access their medical data anywhere using apps of their choice.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nInteroperability and information sharing present a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector. This new initiative is presented as a \"call to action\" and a potential \"paradigm shift\" for the U.S. healthcare system. It seeks to accelerate data flow, allowing patients to access medical data, claims, and prior authorizations. The CMS did not clarify how this new initiative will interact with the recently launched TEFCA framework. This lack of clarity regarding coordination with existing efforts like TEFCA could challenge the perception of a unified or singular path forward for health data exchange.\n\n**The big picture:**\nInteroperability and information sharing have long been a challenge for healthcare, hindered by siloed data and reliance on dated technology. Recent progress occurred in late 2023 with the launch of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA). TEFCA began with five Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs), which have since expanded to nine. The Trump administration's new data sharing initiative represents an additional effort to address this persistent industry challenge.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   More than 60 companies pledged to participate in the initiative.\n*   21 companies pledged to become CMS Aligned Networks.\n*   11 health systems pledged to participate in the networks.\n*   30 companies joined to improve health outcomes with technology.\n*   TEFCA launched with 5 QHINs and has since expanded to 9.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Trump administration:** Announced a new initiative to boost health data sharing.\n*   **Amazon:** A major technology firm partnering in the new health data sharing initiative.\n*   **Google:** A major technology firm partnering in the new health data sharing initiative.\n*   **UnitedHealth:** A major healthcare firm partnering in the new health data sharing initiative.\n*   **Epic:** An EHR and health IT vendor involved in the initiative, pledging to be a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services):** Announced the initiative and aims for results in Q1 next year.\n*   **Dr. Mehmet Oz:** CMS Administrator who stated the initiative will cause a \"paradigm shift.\"\n*   **AdvaMed:** An influential medtech lobbying group that praised the new data sharing initiative.\n*   **Shaye Mandle:** Executive director of AdvaMed\u2019s Digital Health Tech division, who praised the initiative.\n*   **Surescripts:** An e-prescribing data exchange that is a new addition to QHINs under TEFCA.\n*   **eClinicalWorks:** An ambulatory EHR vendor that is a new addition to QHINs and a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **Oracle Health:** An EHR and health IT vendor pledging to become a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **athenahealth:** An EHR and health IT vendor pledging to become a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **CommonWell Health Alliance:** A data exchange with QHIN status pledging to be a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **Cleveland Clinic:** A health system pledging to participate in the networks to accept patient information digitally.\n*   **Bon Secours Mercy Health:** A health system pledging to participate in the networks to accept patient information digitally.\n*   **Intermountain Health:** A health system pledging to participate in the networks to accept patient information digitally.\n*   **Apple:** A company that joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology.\n*   **Samsung:** A company that joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The initiative aims to \"deliver results for the American people\" in the first quarter next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew Trump administration health data push seeks \"paradigm shift,\" bypassing old tech.",

The company has published a paper on a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure algorithm.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPatients wear the Cardiotag device on their chest. The sensors monitor the heart\u2019s electrical activity, changes in blood volume and vibrations on the chest wall associated with cardiac mechanical activity. Cardiosense raised $15.1 million in 2022 to develop the device.\n\nAndrew Carek, Cardiosense\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in a statement that the device will play a foundational role in the company\u2019s noninvasive cardiac AI platform. Cardiosense will use signals collected by Cardiotag as inputs for the development of AI models.\n\nCardiosense has received breakthrough device designation for its PCWP algorithm but has not yet secured 510(k) clearance for the model. Changes in PCWP and pulmonary artery pressure can precede symptomatic hemodynamic congestion, a driver of heart failure decompensation, by weeks, according to Cardiosense\u2019s paper. Abbott\u2019s implantable Cardiomems sensor monitors PAP, but researchers have said there are barriers to widespread use of the devices.\n\nCardiosense is developing the PCWP model to lower the barriers to monitoring. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Heart Failure found Cardiotag paired with the algorithm estimated PCWP with an accuracy approaching implantable hemodynamic sensors. The authors of the paper compared Cardiotag favorably to devices such as Zoll Medical\u2019s Heart Failure Management System.\n\nIn another study, Cardiosense derived left ventricular ejection time from data collected by its wearable. LVET is a measure of how effectively the heart is pumping blood. The value is shortened in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The study found Cardiotag matched the accuracy of existing wearable methods such as impedance cardiography.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBy the numbers Q2 revenue: $1.16 billion 15% increase year over year Q2 net income: $179.8 million 25% increase year over year\n\nDexcom raised its sales expectations for 2025 amid expanding access to its glucose sensors for people with Type 2 diabetes. The company raised its revenue forecast to a range of $4.6 billion to about $4.63 billion for 2025, after forecasting $4.6 billion last quarter.\n\nCFO Jereme Sylvain, on a Wednesday earnings call, attributed the change to three of the major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers now covering Dexcom\u2019s continuous glucose monitors for people with Type 2 diabetes who don\u2019t take insulin. The company is also looking to adoption of its over-the-counter device, Stelo, as a growth driver.\n\nAlthough Dexcom does not disclose exact user numbers, outgoing CEO Kevin Sayer said the company\u2019s Stelo app has been downloaded more than 400,000 times. Dexcom launched the over-the-counter glucose sensor last year, with the intent of marketing it to people with Type 2 diabetes who don\u2019t take insulin. However, most of the recent uptake has been by people who don\u2019t have diabetes and are buying the devices for health and wellness, Sayer said.\n\n\u201cQuite candidly, that's how we designed and developed the app, because last year, at this time, we didn't have very much of any Type 2 coverage for non-insulin users,\u201d Sayer said. \u201cAs time has gone on, and now G7 has coverage by the three largest PBMs in the country, we're seeing a shift.\u201d\n\nPlans for a multi-analyte sensor\n\nDexcom\u2019s main competitor, Abbott, has been working on a dual-analyte sensor that can detect both glucose and ketone levels. The company struck several planned integrations leading up to the American Diabetes Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions last month.\n\nWhen asked about plans for Dexcom\u2019s next flagship CGM, the G8, Chief Operating Officer Jake Leach, who will take over as CEO at the beginning of next year, said the sensor will be 50% smaller and will include a chip that supports multiple analyte sensing. He did not share the timing for the device.\n\nLeach said that there have been a lot of recent discussions around the clinical utility of measuring ketones simultaneously with glucose. Dexcom has a ketone sensor in development, \u201cand we'll bring it to the market when we feel it's appropriate,\u201d Leach said. \u201cBut at this point in time, we're very focused on features that extend safety and ease of use for both our patients as well as the prescribing physicians.\u201d\n\nRegulatory updates\n\nDexcom is still working with the Food and Drug Administration on resolving a warning letter the company received in March, which raised concerns with a design change Dexcom made to a component used in its sensors without submitting a premarket notification to the FDA. Dexcom had begun to produce a chemical internally for its sensor wires to add redundancy to its supply chain, but reverted back to the external supplier after the FDA requested a separate 510(k) submission, J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in March.\n\nThe company has made \u201cquite a bit of progress\u201d in updating its processes and documentation to address the FDA\u2019s concerns, Leach said.\n\nDexcom is also resolving a recall where receivers for its CGMs may not sound an audible alarm for low or high blood sugar levels. Sylvain said the company will be swapping out some receivers. The CFO said Dexcom recorded a charge in the second quarter that had a 100-basis-point impact on its quarterly results.",

The company also expects growth from its over-the-counter device, Stelo. Dexcom is developing a smaller G8 multi-analyte sensor and a separate ketone sensor.\n\n**Why it matters:** The increased sales forecast suggests a larger, more accessible market for Dexcom's CGMs among Type 2 non-insulin users than previously recognized, driven by PBM coverage. The Stelo app's uptake, mostly by non-diabetics for health and wellness, indicates a significant new market beyond traditional diabetes management. This challenges the prior consensus that the Type 2 non-insulin market was less accessible or that non-diabetic wellness users were not a notable segment, as the company previously had little Type 2 coverage for non-insulin users. Dexcom's multi-analyte sensor development signals an intent to compete in advanced monitoring.\n\n**The big picture:** Dexcom manufactures glucose sensors for diabetes management. The company launched its Stelo over-the-counter glucose sensor last year, initially targeting Type 2 non-insulin users. Dexcom's main competitor, Abbott, is also developing a dual-analyte sensor.

While forecasts are lower, the full effect of these trade policies may only become apparent in coming quarters, as most costs are anticipated in the second half of the year.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThree months ago, medical device firms had warned investors about substantial financial impacts in 2025. These warnings were primarily linked to the tariff policies enacted by the Trump administration. The current earnings season has seen a reversal of these dire predictions from several top companies.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   J&J: Approximately $200 million (halved from previous expectation)\n*   Boston Scientific: Approximately $100 million (halved from previous expectation)\n*   Abbott: Under $200 million (lowered from a few hundred million previously)\n*   Philips: 150 million euros to 200 million euros (about 100 million euros less than previously)\n*   Overall reduction: Hundreds of millions of dollars\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Johnson & Johnson (J&J):** Halved tariff impact expectations for 2025 to approximately $200 million.\n*   **Abbott:** Lowered its 2025 tariff forecast to under $200 million from previous higher estimates.\n*   **Boston Scientific:** Halved its 2025 tariff expectations to approximately $100 million.\n*   **Philips:** Reduced its 2025 tariff forecast by about 100 million euros, now expecting 150-200 million euros.\n*   **Trump administration:** Implemented the tariff policies impacting medical device firms.\n*   **Edwards Lifesciences:** Not mentioned in relation to tariffs, but losing a longtime leader in TAVR business.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Several companies expect the majority of tariff-related costs to be incurred in the second half of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMed device firms now foresee lower tariff impacts than initially warned, signaling reduced financial headwinds.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBy the numbers Q2 revenue: $5 billion 3% increase year over year Net income: $486 million Nearly 14% increase year over year\n\nGE HealthCare lowered the expected impact from tariffs on its financial outlook Wednesday and said customer demand for capital equipment remained healthy in the second quarter.\n\nThe medical imaging company boosted its forecast for organic revenue growth in 2025 to 3%, up from a range of 2% to 3%.\n\nHowever, shares in the company fell nearly 8% to end at $71.64 on the New York Stock Exchange, as investors focused on slower-than-expected order growth and a delayed market recovery in China. J.P. Morgan analysts, in a Wednesday note to investors, said second-quarter order growth of about 3% year over year was below the 5% that investors wanted, and the outlook for China was disappointing.\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter Arduini told analysts on the earnings call that the situation in China continues to evolve.\n\n\u201cI'd say China, we're seeing activity pick up, but the market recovery is taking a little bit longer,\u201d said Arduini. \u201cWe think the longer-term outlook will be positive just based on the size of the country.\u201d\n\nStill, with greater clarity from deals struck between the U.S. and global trade partners, GE HealthCare now expects a 45-cent tariff impact to adjusted earnings per share for the full year, roughly half of the 85-cent hit it projected last quarter. The reduction is similar to revised outlooks from other large medical device makers, such as Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, which also halved their tariff impact forecasts.\n\nGE HealthCare raised its full-year outlook for adjusted EPS to a range of $4.43 to $4.63, from the previous forecast of $3.90 to $4.10. The improved outlook follows the company\u2019s steep earnings guidance cut in April.\n\nFor 2026, tariff expenses are expected to be below the 45 cents forecast for 2025 due to mitigation efforts that include supply chain restructuring actions and selective price increases.\n\nCFO Jay Saccaro, on the earnings call, said the company is working on longer-term changes to the supply chain, such as investing in more local manufacturing and shifting capacity within supplier networks to more tariff-friendly locations.\n\n\u201cAs we've seen these trade deals shape up, we're now in a position to begin to execute on some of these, which we'll do in the second half of the year, and then those will benefit 2026,\u201d Saccaro said.\n\nCapital equipment investment\n\nRepublicans\u2019 \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d has sparked concerns among healthcare investors that patient volumes could soften if people lose insurance coverage, with the trend in turn pressuring hospital budgets.\n\nGE HealthCare, however, is seeing a \u201crobust\u201d capital environment and healthy procedure growth, said Saccaro, with customers continuing to invest in innovative imaging equipment.\n\nIn the U.S., hospitals are replacing an aging installed base of equipment, after the replacement cycle was paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Arduini. Further driving demand is a need for imaging to support treatment advances in areas such as electrophysiology and pharmaceuticals that require more follow-up. Hospitals also want equipment that helps increase productivity.\n\n\u201cIt's difficult for U.S. hospitals to get staffed, and so equipment that moves the patient swiftly through the institution with a high-quality diagnosis is a very important asset,\u201d said the CEO.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** GE HealthCare shares fall despite boosted outlook, China recovery lags.\n\n**Key details:** GE HealthCare boosted its 2025 organic revenue growth forecast to 3% and raised its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $4.43-$4.63. The company also lowered its expected 2025 tariff impact on adjusted earnings per share to 45 cents, nearly half of the prior projection. Despite these improvements, shares fell almost 8% as investors focused on slower-than-expected Q2 order growth of about 3% year over year. A delayed market recovery in China and its impact on the outlook were also investor concerns. However, customer demand for capital equipment remained healthy in the second quarter.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information challenges the consensus view that an improved financial outlook and reduced tariff impact would inherently drive positive investor sentiment. Instead, investors prioritized the lower-than-expected order growth and the lagging market recovery in China. This suggests that current market growth and regional performance are more critical for investor confidence than revised earnings forecasts or reduced tariff burdens. The company's robust capital environment in the U.S. offers a counterpoint to broader healthcare investor concerns about patient volumes. Ultimately, U.S. strength was overshadowed by disappointing China performance and overall order growth.\n\n**The big picture:** GE HealthCare is a medical imaging company that recently lowered its tariff impact expectations due to greater clarity from trade deals. This improved outlook follows the company's steep earnings guidance cut in April. Other large medical device makers like Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson have also halved their tariff impact forecasts. GE HealthCare is implementing longer-term supply chain changes, including local manufacturing investments, to mitigate future tariff expenses. In the U.S., hospitals are replacing aging equipment and seeking new imaging to support treatment advances and increase productivity.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $5 billion\n*   Shares fell nearly 8% to $71.64\n*   Q2 order growth: About 3% year over year\n*   2025 tariff impact to adjusted EPS: 45 cents\n*   Full-year adjusted EPS outlook: $4.43 to $4.63\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **GE HealthCare:** Medical imaging company that lowered tariff impact and boosted its financial forecasts.\n*   **Peter Arduini:** GE HealthCare CEO who noted China's market recovery is taking longer than expected.\n*   **J.P.

Currently, 412 units in the portfolio are offline, according to a news release shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\n\u201cHurricane Ida came through the properties and money was not invested back into them,\u201d said Steven Landgraber, senior managing director at New York City-based merchant bank IslandDundon, which was hired to advise Crown Capital on its restructuring strategy. \u201cSome of those units have just been down for quite some time.\u201d\n\nChicago-based commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield and New Orleans-based brokerage firm Larry G. Schedler & Associates are leading the sales effort on behalf of a court-appointed ownership entity representing the portfolio\u2019s debtors. The apartment communities could be sold individually or as a portfolio. There is no set price, and offers are due Sept. 10.\n\n\u201cThese assets have been effectively starved for capital and have not had leadership for quite some time due to prior management\u2019s absence,\u201d Landgraber said.\n\nLarry Schedler, principal of Larry G. Schedler & Associates, told Multifamily Dive that the properties received new roofs after Hurricane Ida, but are still in need of interior renovations.\n\n\u201cAlthough there's some exterior work to do, the majority of the capital that needs to be expended is really going to be in the interiors,\u201d Schedler said. \u201cThree of the four are in the upper-40% to low-50% occupancy range. There is one asset that is about 20% occupied.\u201d\n\nThe portfolio consists of:\n\nCarmel Brook, a 548-unit property, built in 1984\n\nCarmel Spring, a 400-unit property, built in 1983\n\nLaguna Creek, a 216-unit property built in 1981\n\nLaguna Reserve, a 348-unit multifamily community built in 1982\n\nThe portfolio is located within a 3-mile radius along Interstate 10 in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone. That area lost nearly 4,000 units after Hurricane Katrina, making these four properties one-third of the housing stock in the area, according to Schedler.\n\n\u201cThere's a shortage of affordable housing in metro New Orleans, like there is all over the country,\u201d Schedler said. \u201cThis creates a very interesting opportunity for someone. All of these properties have washer-dryer connections, so they would they would be a great candidate for good, solid workforce housing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Schedler said private buyers have shown interest in the portfolio. The right purchaser could potentially transform the entire area.\n\n\u201cIt's a real opportunity for someone to get in there who has the construction expertise to bring these units online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt they would have demand for these units, and I think some of the reverberations of this would certainly help with them trying to create more rooftops out there.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

These properties were previously owned by Crown Capital, whose principal, Moshe \u201cMark\u201d Silber, was sentenced for wire fraud. The portfolio also faces challenges from Hurricane Ida, leaving 412 units offline due to lack of investment. Significant interior renovations are needed across the properties. Current occupancy ranges from about 20% for one asset to upper-40% to low-50% for three others. Offers for the properties are due by September 10.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis sale presents a significant investment opportunity for buyers with construction expertise. The properties could help address the \"shortage of affordable housing\" in metro New Orleans and nationwide. Despite current low occupancy and extensive renovation needs, they could be transformed into \"good, solid workforce housing.\" This challenges a potential view of them as simply distressed assets, highlighting their strategic location within an Opportunity Zone and their potential to significantly impact the local housing market. Their transformation could \"transform the entire area.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe properties were formerly owned by Crown Capital, whose principal was sentenced for wire fraud, contributing to their lack of capital investment and leadership.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEarlier this week, Greensboro, North Carolina-based apartment owner and operator Bell Partners announced that Sarah Young has been appointed to succeed John Tomlinson as chief financial officer, according to a news release .\n\nYoung previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Irving, Texas-based Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of Miami-based homebuilder Lennar. She will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners, which ranked No. 14 on 2025 National Multifamily Housing Council\u2019s Top 50 Manager list with 88,407 units across the U.S.\n\nTomlinson, who plans to retire on Aug. 22, will remain an advisor through the end of 2025 to further support the company and facilitate an orderly transition.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn her new role at Bell, Young will lead the firm\u2019s accounting, corporate finance, tax, financial planning and analysis, legal, compliance and risk management teams. She will also serve on the company\u2019s executive and investment committees, helping guide the company\u2019s strategic direction, business policies and investment decisions.\n\nYoung spent the previous 10 years at Quarterra, where she managed financial operations and strategic planning for the organization and its residential platforms.\n\nYoung also served on Quarterra\u2019s Investment Committee, where she was actively involved in high-level strategic decisions, contributing to the company\u2019s business performance across various platforms, including multifamily, single-family and land finance, according to the release.\n\nHowever, Quarterra has been scaling down its operations over the past couple of years. In a deal that closed last June, New York City-based global investment firm KKR purchased 5,200 units from Quarterra for about $2.1 billion. In September, it sold another 1,400 apartments to QuadReal Property Group, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based global real estate investment, operating and development company.\n\nIn June, New York City-based software provider Alfred and its property management firm, Charlotte-based RKW Residential, merged with Quarterra Living, the apartment operational arm of Quarterra Multifamily. The firm provided roughly 30,000 units to the venture.\n\nSarah Young Retrieved from Bell Partners on July 30, 2025\n\nBefore her tenure at Quarterra, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital, where she managed equity commitments across several funds. She began her career at Ernst & Young LLP.\n\n\u201cSarah Young comes to us with a wealth of experience guiding real estate investment decisions and fund management strategies in increasingly complicated financial arenas,\u201d Dunn said in the news release.\n\nWhile Quarterra has been scaling back, Bell is growing. The firm has been an active buyer of apartments this year, recently purchasing the Montane Apartments, a 400-unit apartment community located in Parker, Colorado, according to a separate news release. It purchased the asset through its Bell Value Add Fund VIII and will rename it Bell Parker Ranch.\n\nIn January, Bell announced it had acquired two properties in Denver and one in Miami on behalf of its Bell Value-Add Fund VIII in separate transactions for a total of $264.3 million.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Bell Partners hires new CFO from firm scaling back operations.\n\n**Key details:**\nBell Partners has appointed Sarah Young as chief financial officer, succeeding John Tomlinson. Young previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Irving, Texas-based Quarterra Group. Tomlinson plans to retire on Aug. 22 but will remain an advisor through 2025 to facilitate an orderly transition. In her new role, Young will lead Bell\u2019s accounting, corporate finance, tax, and risk management teams. She will also serve on the company\u2019s executive and investment committees, helping guide strategic direction and investment decisions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nYoung brings a \"wealth of experience\" in real estate investment decisions and fund management strategies to Bell Partners. This appointment is significant as Bell is actively growing, having recently purchased multiple apartment communities. Her previous employer, Quarterra, however, has been \"scaling down its operations\" by selling units and merging. This contrast suggests that not all real estate firms face the same operational trends. It challenges a generalized view by showing Bell's expansion amidst market activity that saw Young's prior company shrink.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBell Partners is a Greensboro, NC-based apartment owner and operator, ranking No. 14 on the 2025 National Multifamily Housing Council\u2019s Top 50 Manager list. Young\u2019s previous firm, Irving, TX-based Quarterra Group, is a subsidiary of Miami-based homebuilder Lennar. Quarterra scaled down its operations, including selling 5,200 units to KKR for $2.1 billion and 1,400 apartments to QuadReal Property Group. Quarterra Living also merged with Alfred and RKW Residential, contributing roughly 30,000 units to the venture. In contrast, Bell is growing, having recently purchased a 400-unit apartment community and three properties for $264.3 million.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Bell Partners: No. 14 on 2025 National Multifamily Housing Council\u2019s Top 50 Manager list.\n*   Bell Partners: 88,407 units across the U.S.\n*   Quarterra: Sold 5,200 units to KKR for about $2.1 billion.\n*   Quarterra: Sold another 1,400 apartments to QuadReal Property Group.\n*   Bell Value-Add Fund VIII: Acquired properties for a total of $264.3 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Bell Partners:** Apartment owner and operator appointing a new chief financial officer.\n*   **Sarah Young:** Appointed new chief financial officer of Bell Partners.\n*   **John Tomlinson:** Retiring chief financial officer of Bell Partners, remaining an advisor.\n*   **Quarterra Group:** Young's previous employer, a firm scaling down its operations.\n*   **Lennar:** Parent company of Quarterra Group, a Miami-based homebuilder.\n*   **Lili Dunn:** CEO and president of Bell Partners, Young will report to her.\n*   **KKR:** Global investment firm that purchased 5,200 units from Quarterra.\n*   **QuadReal Property Group:** Real estate company that purchased 1,400 apartments from Quarterra.\n*   **Alfred:** Software provider that merged with Quarterra Living.\n*   **RKW Residential:** Property management firm that merged with Quarterra Living.\n*   **Walton Street Capital:** Young was part of the finance group before Quarterra.\n*   **Ernst & Young LLP:** Where Young began her professional career.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   John Tomlinson's retirement from Bell Partners on August 22.\n*   Tomlinson will remain an advisor through the end of 2025 to support the transition.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nBell Partners' strategic CFO hire signals continued growth amidst market shifts.",

It will also house the permanent headquarters and practice facility for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u201cOne of the more positive recent developments will be the Rams' 52-acre mixed-use development,\u201d Rath said.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

The wrap-style property was purchased from Atlanta-based AMLI Residential and will be rebranded as Kitt at Warner Center. Waterton now owns 3,316 units in the Los Angeles market with this acquisition. The firm plans significant upgrades to the units and common areas, including new appliances, quartz countertops, and reconfigured spaces.\n\n**Why it matters:** This acquisition challenges the prevailing sentiment among some apartment firms to reduce exposure to California due to rent control and regulations. Waterton is actively expanding its Los Angeles portfolio, demonstrating confidence in the region's long-term economic diversity and large metro status. For investors, this suggests a major player sees opportunities in a market many view as high-risk, potentially indicating a different valuation perspective or long-term strategy for asset enhancement. The firm's planned investment in property upgrades also signals a commitment to maximizing value in the current regulatory environment.\n\n**The big picture:** The acquisition occurs while some apartment firms are reducing their exposure to California due to existing rent control and regulations. Waterton, however, is building on its presence, now owning 3,316 units in the Los Angeles market. The AMLI Warner Center property, built in 2007, is largely in original condition, presenting an opportunity for the buyer to invest in upgrades.

As more Americans started to work remotely in 2020 and 2021, developers began to look for ways to better utilize that space.\n\nHousing has emerged as a top use, especially as rents have skyrocketed. Office-to-multifamily conversion projects increased from 12,100 units in progress in 2021 to 71,000 units by the beginning of 2025.\n\nHowever, Ryan Sudeck, CEO of Sage Investment Group, believes another type of conversion can be even more effective in addressing affordable housing challenges.\n\nSudeck\u2019s Kirkland, Washington-based firm acquires underutilized, off-market hotels and motels and transforms them into workforce studio apartments. The company now has 27 properties in six states.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the properties were built in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, although we do have some newer properties, a Marriott Residence Inn in Houston that was built in the 2000s,\u201d Sudeck told Multifamily Dive.\n\nSage owns assets in Washington state, Texas and the Carolinas, and plans to expand into Denver and Orlando, Florida. \u201cWe want to make sure we have good population density around the properties,\u201d Sudeck said.\n\nSage, which is delivering 13 conversions in 2025, intends to hold its properties for five years. The firm prefers hotels with exterior corridors because Sudeck believes they allow for easier transport of construction materials and provide greater separation between residents.\n\n\u201cThey feel like they've got their own space,\u201d Sudeck said. \u201cThey also don't smell each other's cooking.\u201d\n\nHere, Sudeck talks with Multifamily Dive about the transaction pipeline for hotel properties, financing those assets and the impacts of tariffs.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMULTIFAMILY DIVE: Are these generally distressed properties that you\u2019re buying?\n\nRYAN SUDECK: That certainly happens. We recently acquired a portfolio where we paid less than 50 cents on the dollar for what it had last transacted for, about three years prior. So we see a lot of distress.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that distress comes about in hospitality. Hotels fall on hard times. They can't afford a property improvement plan to refresh the property, so they drop a tier, and it's a slippery slope. So in most situations, we're buying distress.\n\nRyan Sudeck Permission granted by Sage Investment Group\n\nThere is also a lot of Indian family ownership. They immigrated in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, ran these hotels, and raised their kids. Their kids are well educated now. Now, the mom or dad or grandfather or grandmother moves on from the family business. We find that these are some of the sellers that we also buy from.\n\nWho are you competing with for these properties?\n\nThere aren\u2019t too many groups doing hotel conversions. Among the larger groups still active in this space, there are certainly hotel operators that will upgrade them.\n\nTypically, we can pay more than hotel operators because our business model is to capitalize on the fundamental difference between what a hotel is worth and what a multifamily property is worth. Whereas a hotel operator is constrained by the cap rate of a hospitality asset.\n\nHow many units do you prefer to convert in one property?\n\nWe're looking for something big enough where we can have on-site property management \u2014 usually over 100 units. But we\u2019re not doing more than 200 units because we're typically delivering fully amenitized studio units into the market, and we don't want to deliver too many and oversaturate the market.\n\nWhat financing are you using once these properties are stabilized? Are you using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?\n\nWe have not yet used agency debt as a refinance vehicle. We're planning to probably do that on one of our assets coming up. Typically, our takeout financing is from local banks and credit unions. They love this type of product.\n\nWith our most recent refinance, we secured a 35-year amortization term. Given the significant upgrades we're making to the properties themselves, banks are willing to give us a longer shelf life on the property itself.\n\nHow are you incorporating the kitchens?\n\nThe hotels we buy do not already have kitchens in them. We're installing the kitchens, and we typically include a full-size refrigerator, a full-size range and a microwave. The range obviously comes with a stovetop too. And so they live like a fully amenitized studio unit.\n\nThen we take all the hotel common spaces and trick them out with various amenities, fitness centers, pools, yoga studios, lounges \u2014 areas for folks to form community.\n\nHow are tariffs affecting your business?\n\nOne of our shipments got hit with a tariff of $33,000, but that's across $45 million worth of spend this year. So, it has had a relatively minor impact. There has been a lot less development by and large, so there is a lot more availability from subs.\n\nWe had been buying offshore, and for the year of 2025, we brought some of those relationships onshore at the same prices we were getting internationally. We were able to negotiate that. So that helped mitigate the effect.\n\nWe usually budget for an 11%-ish contingency over our budget. We have three properties that are scheduled to deliver in the next couple of weeks, and we're 1.2% over budget, which is well within our contingency.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

        "summary": "Here's a summary of the article in the Smart Brevity style:\n\n**Hotel-to-Apartment Conversions Emerge as Potent Affordable Housing Solution**\n\n**Key details:**\nSage Investment Group, led by CEO Ryan Sudeck, acquires underutilized hotels and motels, transforming them into workforce studio apartments. The firm, currently with 27 properties across six states, aims to capitalize on the value difference between hospitality and multifamily assets. Sage focuses on properties over 100 units but under 200, often buying distressed assets or from long-term family owners.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis strategy challenges the prevailing focus on office-to-multifamily conversions as the primary solution for housing needs. Sudeck believes hotel conversions are \"even more effective\" for affordable housing, suggesting a less competitive, potentially more efficient path. By converting hotels, Sage can pay more than traditional hotel operators, leveraging a different valuation model for greater impact.\n\n**The big picture:**\nOffice conversions have received significant attention over the past five years, with units in progress increasing dramatically from 12,100 in 2021 to 71,000 by early 2025. This surge was driven by increased remote work since 2020 and skyrocketing rents, making housing a top priority for underutilized commercial spaces.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Office-to-multifamily conversion units in progress increased from 12,100 (2021) to 71,000 (early 2025).\n*   Sage Investment Group owns 27 properties in six states and is delivering 13 conversions in 2025.\n*   Sage acquired a portfolio for less than 50 cents on the dollar compared to its prior transaction.\n*   Sage's recent refinance secured a 35-year amortization term.\n*   Projects are 1.2% over budget, well within their usual 11%-ish contingency.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ryan Sudeck:** CEO of Sage Investment Group, advocates for hotel conversions as effective affordable housing solutions.\n*   **Sage Investment Group:** Kirkland, Washington-based firm converting hotels and motels into workforce studio apartments.\n*   **Multifamily Dive:** Publication that conducted the interview with Ryan Sudeck about hotel conversion strategies.\n*   **Marriott Residence Inn:** Example of a newer property type from the 2000s that Sage Investment Group has acquired.\n*   **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:** Agencies whose debt Sage Investment Group plans to potentially use for future refinance vehicles.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Sage plans to expand operations into Denver and Orlando, Florida.\n*   Sage intends to use agency debt from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on one of its assets soon.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nHotel conversions offer an effective, less competitive path to affordable housing solutions.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nContainerboard producers are being hit with a class-action antitrust lawsuit accusing them of creating a \u201ccartel\u201d and engaging in price collusion to boost profits at the expense of customers, as first reported by Bloomberg Law.\n\nOn Tuesday, Artuso Pastry Foods Corp. filed the complaint in federal court in Illinois against entities including Cascades, Georgia-Pacific, Graphic Packaging International, Greif, International Paper, Packaging Corporation of America, Pratt Industries and Smurfit Westrock over a series of seven price increases from November 2020 to the present .\n\n. Artuso Pastry is requesting that plaintiffs receive treble damages, an amount three times the damages eventually awarded by the court. It also seeks injunctive relief, in which a court orders violating parties to stop taking a particular action, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThis is not the first time major containerboard producers have faced a price collusion class action lawsuit. In one example, Minnesota-based cleaning products company Kleen Products in 2010 brought a suit against nearly 10 containerboard producers, also in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on accusations of conspiring to increase prices and reduce output from 2004 to 2010.\n\nThat case resulted in multiple containerboard companies, including Packaging Corporation of America and International Paper, settling via multimillion-dollar payments, although Georgia-Pacific and WestRock went to court. Many of the defendants in the Kleen Products case are also named in the new lawsuit.\n\nIn this week\u2019s nearly 50-page filing, Artuso Pastry said current containerboard producers and their predecessors have engaged in anticompetitive behavior and price fixing for more than 85 years. It says in the last five years, defendants engaged in \u201cnumerous unprecedented and unjustified price increases, often implemented at the exact same time and for the exact same increase.\u201d This \u201cconspiracy\u201d resulted in customers paying higher prices for containerboard than would have existed in a competitive market, according to the filing.\n\nThis lawsuit stems from Mount Vernon, New York-based Artuso Pastry purchasing containerboard products from WestRock, now Smurfit Westrock, and paying \u201can artificially high price,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nSmurfit Westrock does not comment on pending litigation, but it is aware of the lawsuit and reviewing it, a company spokesperson told Packaging Dive on Wednesday. Georgia-Pacific also emailed a statement: \u201cThese claims against Georgia-Pacific are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend the company.\u201d The other companies Packaging Dive contacted Wednesday did not respond by publication time.\n\nThe plaintiff claims that containerboard prices were relatively stable throughout the 2010s, but have jumped dramatically over the last five years \u2014 33% from November 2020 to September 2022. The lawsuit alleges that no changes occurred to economic conditions such as input costs or demand \u201cthat could plausibly account for the magnitude of the price increases\u201d that the producers implemented.\n\nReasons that producers have cited for the hikes include increased input costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. Some industry observers have questioned the timing of containerboard price hikes during the last two years, citing weak demand and a global oversupply.\n\nPart of the problem is the amount of industry consolidation that has occurred over the last few decades, the lawsuit says, citing that just a handful of companies now control the vast majority of market share, 85%, for containerboard products. It notes numerous major M&A deals in the industry over the last 25 years, including last year\u2019s combination of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, IP\u2019s acquisition of DS Smith in January, and the early July announcement that PCA would buy Greif\u2019s containerboard business. This type of concentration makes the market more susceptible to collusion, according to the plaintiff.\n\nDefendants took a two-year pause on major price increases but resumed in December 2023, the suit says. At that time, numerous manufacturers announced nearly identical price increases for various board grades, set to take effect in January and February. That spring, a cluster of companies announced they would again raise prices in June 2024, with analysts pointing to a leading index only partially recognizing the first increase. More announcements started late in 2024 for price bumps taking effect this year, with more than a dozen manufacturers ultimately becoming part of that movement.\n\nAlthough subtle differences existed in the different companies\u2019 price hikes, \u201cthe lockstep movements further reinforced a repeated pattern of parallel pricing,\u201d the lawsuit says. The plaintiff says containerboard producers\u2019 collusion defies economic logic and goes against their individual self interests.\n\nThe plaintiff further argues that containerboard producers engaged in capacity restrictions, specifically that they used \u201cvalue over volume\u201d strategies and facility closures to restrict volumes. It cites numerous closures by WestRock, International Paper and Greif, along with executives\u2019 repeated public references to \u201cvalue over volume\u201d in recent years.\n\nThe court docket shows Artuso Pastry\u2019s attorneys appeared in court Wednesday. Another document indicates involved parties must jointly provide the judge with a status update by Dec. 17.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Containerboard Producers Hit With New Antitrust Lawsuit Over Price Collusion\n\n**Key details:** Artuso Pastry Foods Corp. filed a new antitrust class-action lawsuit against containerboard producers, accusing them of forming a \"cartel\" and engaging in price collusion. The complaint cites seven price increases from November 2020 to the present, alleging these were \"unprecedented and unjustified\" and implemented simultaneously. Artuso Pastry is seeking treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees, claiming customers paid artificially high prices.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit challenges the containerboard industry's pricing practices, alleging a \"cartel\" instead of market forces drove recent price increases. It directly disputes producers' cited reasons for price hikes, such as increased input costs, claiming no economic changes justify the magnitude. This suggests a potential misrepresentation of market dynamics, as the plaintiff argues collusion defies economic logic. If successful, it could force a re-evaluation of current industry valuation based on artificially inflated profits.\n\n**The big picture:** This lawsuit marks a repeat for the containerboard industry, as similar price collusion class actions, such as the 2010 Kleen Products case, previously resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements. The plaintiff alleges anticompetitive behavior for over 85 years, exacerbated by significant industry consolidation. Currently, a few companies control 85% of the market share, which the lawsuit claims makes the industry highly susceptible to collusion.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Seven alleged price increases implemented from November 2020 to the present.\n* Containerboard prices jumped 33% from November 2020 to September 2022.\n* A handful of companies control 85% of the containerboard market share.\n* The lawsuit alleges anticompetitive behavior has occurred for more than 85 years.\n* Defendants took a two-year pause on major price increases before resuming in December 2023.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* **Artuso Pastry Foods Corp.:** Plaintiff filing the class-action antitrust lawsuit over alleged price collusion.\n* **Cascades:** Defendant company named in the new antitrust class-action lawsuit.\n* **Georgia-Pacific:** Defendant company in the new lawsuit; stated claims are without merit.\n* **Graphic Packaging International:** Defendant company named in the new antitrust class-action lawsuit.\n* **Greif:** Defendant company in the new lawsuit; cited for capacity restrictions.\n* **International Paper:** Defendant company named in the new lawsuit; previously settled similar litigation.\n* **Packaging Corporation of America:** Defendant company in the new lawsuit; previously settled similar litigation.\n* **Pratt Industries:** Defendant company named in the new antitrust class-action lawsuit.\n* **Smurfit Westrock:** Defendant company in the new lawsuit; declined to comment on pending litigation.\n* **Kleen Products:** Company that filed a similar price collusion lawsuit in 2010.\n* **Smurfit Kappa:** Combined with WestRock last year, part of industry consolidation mention.\n* **WestRock:** Mentioned for facility closures and involvement in a previous lawsuit.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* Involved parties must jointly provide the judge with a status update by December 17.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Containerboard producers face another major lawsuit challenging their pricing and market power.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPaper cups are for the first time part of the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s materials specifications list, the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. Graphic Packaging International praised the cups update, calling it \u201ca major milestone in a broader movement to increase awareness and drive greater collection of paper cups in recycling systems,\u201d according to a Monday news release.\n\nReMa's ISRI specifications set standards for the quality of recycled materials and serve as a guide for scrap material buyers' and sellers' transactions. However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

This revision is a direct result of increased design and labor costs associated with a project in Texas. Additionally, CEO Mike Doss highlighted a \"highly unusual\" reduction in consumer spending. These factors collectively led to the adjustment in the company's financial outlook.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe restatement of capital expenditures and free cash flow suggests higher-than-expected costs at the Texas project, impacting the company's financial outlook. CEO Mike Doss's observation of a \"highly unusual\" decline in consumer spending signals broader economic headwinds potentially affecting demand for the company's products. This information could challenge a market expectation of stable project costs or resilient consumer demand for Graphic Packaging International. It points to potential challenges for both company-specific project management and the broader consumer market.\n\n**The big picture:**\nGraphic Packaging International is engaged in a project in Texas, which is incurring unexpected design and labor costs. These escalating costs are significant enough to necessitate a restatement of the company's financial projections.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUpcoming negotiations in Geneva meant to finalize a global agreement to end plastic pollution will have important implications for recycling supply chains, business innovations and brands\u2019 voluntary plastic reduction commitments, said speakers during a Tuesday roundtable hosted by the Solid Waste Association of North America in Washington, D.C.\n\nSpeakers from WM, the Circular Action Alliance, SC Johnson and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they are closely monitoring the upcoming round of Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings that will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSome of these outcomes of INC-5.2 may impact plastic production, design and available end markets, which is really crucial,\u201d said Amy Lestition Burke, SWANA\u2019s CEO.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear just what direction this round of negotiations may take, Burke said waste and packaging stakeholders are watching for major movement on topics such as proposed extended producer responsibility models or proposed limits on overall plastic production. Those two facets could meaningfully shape recycling supply chains and influence brands\u2019 packaging design decisions, she said.\n\nThe Geneva negotiations are a continuation of a long-term discussion between global governments and stakeholders that started in 2022 and is meant to develop an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution. The goal was to complete the process by the end of 2024, but negotiators did not reach an agreement at what was supposed to be the final meeting in Busan, South Korea, in November.\n\nThough stakeholders from waste and packaging groups previously expressed frustration and disappointment that the negotiations have dragged into 2025, speakers at the SWANA event said a plastics treaty is nonetheless worth the time and effort.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can all agree on is that the waste and resource resource management industry is key to this, and it is a solution,\u201d Lestition Burke said.\n\nChuck Chaitovitz, vice president of environmental affairs and sustainability for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the ideal plastics treaty outcome would offer a \u201cglobal framework that drives country ambition\u201d while helping to provide \u201ceffective collection and reuse systems and end markets where we would have a circular economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber sent a letter in June to the U.S. State Department urging the federal government to continue participating in plastics treaty negotiations by advocating for an end to plastic pollution, but not an end to plastic use altogether. \u201cAn effective agreement would provide global economic opportunities,\u201d the Chamber wrote.\n\nA global plastics treaty must include investments in infrastructure that can boost recycling in both developed and developing countries, but those investments must also ensure long-term end markets for recycled materials, said Ganesh Nagarajan, senior director of plastics for WM.\n\n\u201cThese investments need to happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about having a framework or an agreement in place, but you need to really have those sustainable end markets behind it.\u201d\n\nBolstering end markets could help raise recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials such as plastic film and flexibles, he said. WM is currently working on some pilot programs to ramp up recycling for these materials, but is so far only recycling the materials customers are accidentally putting in their bins. \u201cOnly 2% is recycled today, so that's a large untapped opportunity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a robust and predictable end market\u201d before telling customers that such materials are allowed in curbside bins.\n\nMany global brands are already working on voluntary recycled content goals that are driving the market for recycled materials, said Jeff Bezzo, plastics sustainability leader at SC Johnson. But voluntary actions alone won\u2019t cut it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've made some great progress,\u201d Bezzo said, noting that 25% of the company's packaging globally is made with recycled content. \u201cWe'd like to do more. It is hard to be competitive when you're doing voluntary actions versus everybody rowing together in the same direction. That means the brand owners, the waste haulers, the reclaimers, all the way through the entire circle.\u201d\n\nSC Johnson is also a founding member of the Circular Action Alliance, the producer responsibility organization that manages extended producer responsibility programs for six U.S. states.\n\n\u201cWe see EPR as a key legislative tool to expand recycling, because most municipalities, let's face it, have stretched budgets,\u201d he said. Better funding mechanisms means more collection, better MRF infrastructure and more developed end markets, he said.\n\nBezzo sees EPR as an important tool for global treaty discussions, too. \u201cIn a global treaty, we'd love to see EPR as part of that design guideline, so manufacturers around the world have some certainty around what packaging they should be putting into the market, so it has its best chance to get recycled,\u201d he said.\n\nFor recycled content discussions, Bezzo said it\u2019s important for brands to see PCR content requirements \u201cratchet up over time.\u201d That would allow recycled plastics suppliers time to ensure they have viable end markets, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber recognizes that \u201cthere is a role to play for EPR in a global agreement,\u201d Chaitovitz said. However, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to consider these issues globally\u201d when U.S. stakeholders alone are still grappling with key aspects of EPR programs, such as PRO funding mechanisms and decisions about who gets to be in the PRO. \u201cAlso, we need to decide who gets the materials back, both those in the recycling space who want to recycle it, but then those brand owners and others that want to reuse that material to continue to make valuable products.\u201d\n\nFor WM, EPR could be an important driver as long as it has built-in demand drivers, such as minimum recycled content thresholds, Nagarajan said.\n\nPrevious INC meeting discussions included debates over whether to enforce virgin plastics production caps, and speakers at the SWANA event said they\u2019ll be watching to see what direction those discussions take in Geneva.\n\nBezzo said brands should already be reducing virgin demand. Such virgin reductions can be advanced by PCR requirements and other drivers like product lightweighting and reuse and refill programs.\n\nConsumers are already expressing an interest in products made with less plastic, Chaitovitz added, \u201cbut it's the market that needs to decide.\u201d",

These outcomes are expected to significantly impact recycling supply chains, packaging design decisions, and available end markets.\n\n**Why it matters:** The Geneva negotiations could fundamentally reshape how companies manage plastic, moving beyond current voluntary commitments. Major movement on extended producer responsibility models or plastic production limits could challenge the existing industry approach of relying solely on brand-driven initiatives.

The resulting global framework aims to drive country ambition and establish effective collection and reuse systems.\n\n**The big picture:** These upcoming negotiations are the latest round in a series of global discussions that began in 2022, aiming to establish an international, legally binding agreement to combat plastic pollution. The initial target was to finalize this agreement by the end of 2024.

The company stated its conduct had \"legitimate business justifications\" and was procompetitive, including in response to the Durbin Amendment. Visa also denied striking agreements with fintech firms to prevent debit market competition. Separately, a revised schedule was filed for the case, setting new discovery deadlines. Visa again asked Judge Koeltl to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nVisa's formal denial directly refutes the U.S. Department of Justice's allegations of operating an illegal debit card monopoly. The company asserts its business conduct, including responses to the Durbin Amendment, was procompetitive and reasonably justified.

Zelle has begun funding a series of free workshops in conjunction with the national non-profit group Consumer Action.\n\n\u201cWe train the trainers and then they go out and work in their local communities,\u201d Zelle General Manager Denise Leonhard said in a July interview.\n\nZelle is a digital payment network used by consumers and businesses to send and receive money.\n\nThe community leaders and groups who will attend the workshops include union leaders and advocacy organizations as well as groups that work with the elderly, Leonhard said.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Early Warning Services\n\nThe sessions will also include groups that work with people who speak Chinese and Spanish, Consumer Action Executive Director Anna Flores said in a July interview.\n\n\"We've been doing this for a number of years,\" Flores said. The organization connects with community leaders from underserved populations \"and we train them on consumer protection issues, mostly in the financial services space.\"\n\nThe difference now is that the workshops organized in conjunction with Zelle will focus entirely on scams and fraud, she said.\n\nConsumer Action connected with Zelle because both organizations are part of the Aspen Institute, which has a national task force on preventing fraud and scams, Flores said. A meeting of that task force is where an EWS representative first approached Flores, she said.\n\nThe first workshop was held in New York City on July 22 and more workshops are planned in Los Angeles in September and Scottsdale, Arizona in December, according to an Early Warnings Services news release. An undetermined city in North Carolina will also hold a workshop in the first quarter of next year, Flores said.\n\nThe gatherings are intended to educate community leaders on spotting red flags that can identify fraudsters and scammers so they can better educate populations that are particularly vulnerable to fraud, such as the elderly, Flores said.\n\nZelle\u2019s parent, EWS, is owned by seven big banks. It has recently added hundreds of smaller community banks to its network.\n\nExecutives from EWS and the owner banks have appeared before Senate committee panels to explain what the service is doing to prevent fraud, congressional investigations have found that Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams and news outlets have reported that the payment service allowed fraud to proliferate.\n\nMore than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud, an Early Warning Services spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201dThe fact is scams don\u2019t start on Zelle, they start with criminals manipulating people long before dollars move,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe real threat isn\u2019t the payment method. It\u2019s the criminals \u2013 both in the U.S. and increasingly in foreign countries \u2013 exploiting American through texts, DMs and online marketplace scams.\u201d\n\nThe company helped organize the workshops because use of the platform is on the rise, Leonhard said, noting that payment volume on Zelle exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n\nThe four initial workshops are offered free of charge because of Zelle\u2019s financial contribution, Flores said. The company and the group hope to schedule more sessions and other cities in the future.\n\nEarly Warning Services recently pitched Zelle to the U.S. Treasury Department as a viable option for sending money to taxpayers as the federal government considers how to end its use of paper checks.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Zelle Launches Anti-Scam Training Amid Fraud Concerns\n\n**Key details:** Early Warning Services (EWS) and Consumer Action are launching free workshops to train community leaders on spotting scams and fraud. These sessions are intended to educate leaders on identifying fraudsters to better protect vulnerable populations like the elderly. Zelle, EWS's peer-to-peer payment service, is funding these initiatives. The first workshop was held in New York City, with more planned for Los Angeles, Scottsdale, and an undetermined North Carolina city.\n\n**Why it matters:** Zelle has faced significant criticism from consumer advocates and lawmakers for allegedly allowing fraud to proliferate on its platform. Congressional investigations found Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams. This new training initiative, funded by Zelle, represents a direct response to these concerns. It may challenge the view that Zelle is the primary source of fraud by shifting focus to external criminal manipulation, as the company states, \"scams don\u2019t start on Zelle.\"\n\n**The big picture:** Zelle is a digital payment network for sending and receiving money, with its parent company EWS owned by seven large banks and numerous smaller community banks. EWS executives and owner banks have previously appeared before Senate committees to address fraud prevention. The national non-profit Consumer Action specializes in training community leaders on consumer protection issues. The collaboration between Zelle and Consumer Action stemmed from their shared involvement in the Aspen Institute's national task force on fraud prevention.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   More than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud.\n*   Congressional investigations found Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams.\n*   Zelle's payment volume exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n*   Early Warning Services (EWS) is owned by seven big banks.\n*   Four initial workshops are planned, including New York City, Los Angeles, Scottsdale, and an undetermined North Carolina city.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Early Warning Services (EWS):** Parent company of Zelle, organizing new workshops to combat scams and fraud.\n*   **Consumer Action:** Non-profit partnering with EWS/Zelle to train community leaders against fraud.\n*   **Zelle:** Peer-to-peer payment service, under fire for fraud, now funding new workshops.\n*   **Denise Leonhard:** Zelle General Manager, noted workshops train trainers and platform use is rising.\n*   **Anna Flores:** Consumer Action Executive Director, stated workshops focus entirely on scams and fraud.\n*   **Aspen Institute:** Organization that connected Zelle and Consumer Action through its fraud prevention task force.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   More workshops are planned for Los Angeles in September and Scottsdale, Arizona in December.\n*   An undetermined North Carolina city will host a workshop in the first quarter of next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Zelle invests in external education to combat fraud concerns and improve platform reputation.",

This is the suburban Chicago-based company\u2019s second acquisition announcement this month, after saying last week that it would buy the cloud-based payments player LedgerPay.\n\nBuying BlueSnap, which also provides accounts receivables automation, will allow the combined entity to process card-not-present, electronic check and other payments in 47 countries and some 100 different currencies, according to a Friday press release about the transaction. It will also allow for use of embedded invoicing as well as subscription billing and automated reconciliation with real-time dashboards, the release said.\n\nA spokesperson for Tinley Park, Illinois-based Payroc didn\u2019t respond to a question about the purchase price for BlueSnap.

The workforce reductions associated with the plan are expected to be completed by 2027, the filing said.\n\nIt\u2019s a major \u201cexistential\u201d technology upgrade for a company that\u2019s considered the \u201cgrand-daddy\u201d of the fintech industry, TD Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin said in an interview. It\u2019s a part of providing the technology support for their new initiatives and re-accelerating growth, he said, referring to plans laid out at a February meeting with investors and analysts by PayPal CEO Alex Chriss and other executives.\n\n\u201cLarge organizations need modern technology, and that's a component of this,\u201d Bergin explained in a Thursday interview. \u201cSo a lot of this has to do with making sure they are on the most modern technology, and it is also about consolidating disparate systems behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nThe company laid out the benefits it\u2019s seeking by way of the restructuring in its quarterly filing. \u201cManagement undertook a large-scale initiative (the \u2018Q2 2025 Plan\u2019) to re-engineer our existing technology infrastructure to improve scalability, reduce network latency, decrease operational costs, and optimize our workforce,\u201d the filing said.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Jose, California-based company declined to comment on the workforce reduction beyond the quarterly filing, which didn\u2019t specify how many employees will be cut.\n\nThe restructuring was mentioned only briefly during a Tuesday webcast with analysts to discuss the company\u2019s second-quarter financial results.\n\n\u201cYou'll also see in our (second-quarter) materials that we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $92 million,\u201d PayPal\u2019s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, told analysts during the webcast, referencing a non-GAAP figure. \u201cThese costs are related to workforce actions and the key tech transformation initiatives that we discussed in our investor day,\u201d she said.\n\nChriss, who took the top post in September 2023, has replaced much of the company\u2019s management team and set a new strategic course since taking over from Dan Schulman, who struggled to expand the company\u2019s business after a temporary benefit from COVID-19 e-commerce activity.\n\nThe three-year initiative will \u201cre-engineer infrastructure, streamline operations and exit certain data centers as we unify platforms and migrate more to cloud-based solutions,\u201d Miller said. Benefits of the overhaul will include increased speed, more flexibility in operations, better data utilization and increased scalability, she added.\n\nBased on the quarterly disclosure, the company expects to absorb as much as $300 million in overall cost reductions under the restructuring plan over time. Overall, PayPal forecast $90 million to $100 million in employee severance costs; $40 million to $60 million in accelerated depreciation expense; and other costs of $110 million to $140 million related to the initiative, the filing said.\n\nSome of the other costs are related to the re-engineering work, migration to cloud-based software expense, contractor costs, consulting fees, prepaid software expense and maintenance costs, the filing said. Still, the plan is still developing and the cost estimates could change, PayPal noted.\n\nThe restructuring is also designed to allow the company to better compete with a slew of fintechs entering the payments arena. The current PayPal management team is showing \u201cmore urgency in ultimately modernizing the company because if you don't it's going to be much more difficult in to compete with digital, native players built on stacks today,\u201d Bergin said.\n\nDespite some macroeconomic headwinds this year, including related to U.S. tariffs, the company\u2019s PayPal namesake payments business for merchants, its Braintree offering for larger businesses and Venmo peer-to-peer system continued to expand.\n\nThe company\u2019s second-quarter payments volume rose 6%, or 5% on a foreign exchange neutral basis, including 45%-plus growth in its Venmo volume and 20%-plus growth in buy now, pay later payments volume, the earnings report showed.\n\nSecond-quarter net income rose 12% over the year-ago period to $1.26 billion as revenue climbed 5% to $8.29 billion, including a 20% jump in revenue from Venmo, PayPal said.\n\nSecond-quarter sales and administrative expense dropped 19% to $461 million from a year ago, according to the earnings report, likely reflecting the smaller workforce. Those costs typically include labor expenses.\n\nAs of the end of last year, PayPal had about 24,400 employees worldwide, including about 8,900 in the U.S., according to the company\u2019s annual filing with the SEC in February.\n\nPayPal also noted a \u201cworkforce reduction\u201d that began in the first quarter related to a new regulation in an unidentified international market, saying in the quarterly filing that it resulted in costs for the first half of the year of $36 million.\n\nRestructuring and related costs have been a reality for the company for the past two years. While the overall \u201crestructuring and other\u201d charge for the second quarter this year was 3% higher at $116 million relative to the same quarter last year, PayPal\u2019s $182 million expense for the first half of this year was 44% lower than for the first half of 2024, according to the filing.",

        "summary_text": "Shareholders of Wise voted overwhelmingly Monday to move the U.K.-based money transfer company\u2019s primary stock listing to New York from London.\n\nThe vote was not without controversy, however. The vote on relisting Wise was bundled alongside a measure that lets Class B shareholders in the company retain \u201cgolden share\u201d supervoting powers for 10 more years.\n\nUnder Wise policy, Class B shares, owned by the company\u2019s longtime investors, are worth nine votes apiece, while Class A shares are worth one. But the Class B voting power was limited to five years after the company went public. That debut came in 2021, so golden shares were due to expire next year.\n\nCoupling the two measures drew backlash from one of the fintech\u2019s co-founders, Taavet Hinrikus, who urged shareholders last week to reject the relisting, on the thought the golden share extension would give too much power to his former business partner, Wise CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann.\n\n\u201cEvery CEO would like to have special rights forever. Every shareholder says they should not exist,\u201d Hinrikus said, according to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe question is how do you impose time limits, so everyone feels good, and how do you do it transparently?\u201d\n\nAs it stands, K\u00e4\u00e4rmann owns an 18% stake in Wise but controls just less than 50% of the votes in the company because of his Class B shares. Hinrikus, by comparison, owns 5.1% of Wise\u2019s shares.\n\nWise asserted in June that moving its primary listing to the U.S. would draw retail and institutional investors, increase its liquidity and perhaps boost its valuation, currently around $17 billion.\n\nBut K\u00e4\u00e4rmann remains cautious that outside forces may pressure Wise to increase fees as a method to boost earnings, Bloomberg reported, citing sources who have worked with the CEO.\n\nPerhaps another concern is that activist investors might push Wise to pay dividends. The company\u2019s technology may also draw interest from an acquiring bank.\n\nHinrikus, meanwhile, accused Wise of trying to bury the detail that the relisting vote would also include the supervoting extension. (The first mention of the supervoting measure came on page 10 of the proposal Wise sent to its investors.)\n\nThe supervoting measure was hidden so well, Hinrikus argued, that proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services didn\u2019t mention it on first pass. Each later issued an addendum.\n\n\u201cGlass Lewis believes multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights are typically not in the best interests of common shareholders,\u201d the proxy adviser wrote in a report July 22, adding it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Glass Lewis ultimately advised Wise shareholders to back the move.\n\nWise needed a majority of Class A and B shareholders to approve the measure \u2013 with the caveat that a \u201csupermajority\u201d of investors holding 75% of the value of the company\u2019s stock must vote in favor of the relisting proposal for it to pass.\n\nIt received support from holders of more than 90% of its Class A stock and nearly 85% of its Class B shares.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that our owners have overwhelmingly approved the proposal, giving us a strong mandate to proceed,\u201d Wise Chair David Wells said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe appreciate the extensive engagement with our owners. With this high level of support, our focus is firmly on moving forward.\u201d\n\nWise plans to keep a secondary listing in the U.K. A court in the country must also give its blessing on the move.\n\nStill, the dual measure draws skepticism from some observers of the space.\n\n\u201cWhenever anyone wants to extend dual-class shares for 10 years, there are legitimate concerns about their motivations,\u201d Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIs this entrenchment, or is this innocuous?\u201d",

The vote controversially bundled this move with a measure to let Class B shareholders retain \"golden share\" supervoting powers for 10 more years, despite their original 5-year limit expiring next year. Class B shares are worth nine votes apiece, while Class A shares are worth one. Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus opposed the bundled vote, arguing it would give Wise CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann too much power.\n\n**Why it matters:** Wise asserted moving its primary listing to the U.S. would attract retail and institutional investors, increase liquidity, and potentially boost its valuation, currently around $17 billion. However, the controversial extension of supervoting shares raises corporate governance concerns, with one finance professor questioning if it indicates \"entrenchment.\" This challenges the consensus that the listing change is solely beneficial for all shareholders, given objections from a co-founder and initial oversight by proxy advisers who later expressed concern about unequal voting rights. CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann also remains cautious about outside forces pressuring Wise to increase fees or pay dividends.\n\n**The big picture:** Wise, a U.K.-based money transfer company, went public in 2021, at which point its Class B shares had a five-year limit on their supervoting power. Wise CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann owns an 18% stake but controls just under 50% of the votes due to these shares, while co-founder Taavet Hinrikus owns 5.1%. Hinrikus accused Wise of trying to bury the supervoting extension detail in its proposal. Despite the primary listing move, Wise plans to keep a secondary listing in the U.K.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Class B shares: Worth nine votes apiece (Class A worth one).\n*   Class B voting power: Extended for 10 more years.\n*   Wise CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann: Owns 18% stake, controls just under 50% of votes.\n*   Wise valuation: Currently around $17 billion.\n*   Shareholder support: Over 90% Class A stock, nearly 85% Class B shares.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Wise:** UK money transfer company whose shareholders approved primary listing move to New York from London.\n*   **Taavet Hinrikus:** Wise co-founder who opposed relisting, citing extended supervoting power concerns.\n*   **Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann:** Wise CEO, whose Class B shares give him significant supervoting control.\n*   **The Wall Street Journal:** Reported comments from co-founder Hinrikus and finance professor Jay Ritter.\n*   **Bloomberg:** Reported CEO K\u00e4\u00e4rmann's caution about outside forces pressuring fee increases.\n*   **Glass Lewis:** Proxy adviser concerned about unequal voting rights, initially missed supervoting measure.\n*   **Institutional Shareholder Services:** Proxy adviser that also initially missed, then issued an addendum on supervoting.\n*   **David Wells:** Wise Chair who stated owners overwhelmingly approved the proposal to proceed.\n*   **Jay Ritter:** Finance professor who questioned motivations for extending dual-class shares as potentially entrenching.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A U.K. court must give its blessing on the primary listing move.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Wise secures U.S. listing, but governance concerns persist with extended supervotes.",

The fresh funding gave Ramp a $22.5 billion valuation.\n\n\u201cSo, why are we raising another $500 million? (just 45 days after our last round)?\u201d Ramp\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Eric Glyman, wrote Wednesday in a blog post explaining the startup\u2019s reasoning on capital. \u201cBecause we\u2019re at a unique moment in finance. A new beginning.\u201d\n\nThe funds will help Ramp \u201cpick up the pace,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen an agent automatically rebook your hotel if the price drops, the days of back and forth between you, your manager, and travel support feels impossible,\u201d Glyman wrote.\n\nThe company released its first AI-powered autonomous finance agents in July. The bots are built for \u201creal-world policy enforcement, fraud detection, and policy improvement,\u201d Ramp said in a prior July 9 blog post.\n\nNew York-based Ramp \u2013 like rivals that include Airbase, BILL and Brex \u2013 offers corporate clients tools that handle tasks such as expense management, accounting, travel and procurement along with corporate cards and software to analyze and optimize corporate spending.\n\nRamp has raised $1.9 billion in venture funding since it was established in 2019, according to the release.\n\nInvestment firm Iconiq Capital led the funding round, along with the firms that invested in June and seven new investors that included Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, the wife of Apple\u2019s late co-founder; GV (Google Ventures); and T. Rowe Price Associates.\n\n\u201cWe believe Ramp is leading in agentic AI and setting the standard for what AI-powered finance can look like in the coming years \u2013 at a defining inflection point in their journey,\u201d Roy Luo, an Iconiq general partner, said Wednesday in a statement emailed by a Ramp spokesperson.\n\nAI agents will assume the \u201cbusywork\u201d of many finance functions in 2026, Glyman wrote, using the example of a traditional approval process for an employee\u2019s $5 latte. The manual process requires 14 minutes and $20 of human intervention cost for questions, approvals, audits and coding of the coffee expense.\n\n\u201cScale that across 2,000 swipes a month and your finance team is trapped in an endless loop of micro-decisions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn 2027, finance AI will begin handling contracts, which traditionally have flowed from one person to another in corporate procurement, from a vendor to the procurement department, then to legal and finance, ending with a purchase order and the company\u2019s payment, Glyman predicted.\n\nAI agents will start handling these workflows in a parallel process, with procurement schedules reduced from a week or more to minutes, according to Glyman. \u201cWhy can\u2019t legal, risk, and procurement copilots review the same request at once?\u201d he wrote.\n\nRamp is \u201can exciting addition,\u201d to GV\u2019s fintech portfolio, a partner at the investment firm, Elena Sakach, wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\n\u201cCore finance operations remain stuck in decades-old legacy systems,\u201d Sakach wrote. \u201cRamp is changing this by executing on the everyday well. This has fueled their rapid evolution beyond a corporate card into a new-aged financial operations platform.\u201d",

The company launched its first AI-powered autonomous finance agents in July, designed for real-world policy enforcement, fraud detection, and policy improvement.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe rapid capital infusion aims to accelerate Ramp's pace in deploying AI automation tools for corporate finance.

        "summary_text": "Visa, the largest U.S. card network, expects to target its stablecoin strategy to certain markets and uses as the digital currencies become a reality around the world.\n\nVisa CEO Ryan McInerney fleshed out the card network giant\u2019s stablecoin approach during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday, explaining how it makes sense for the company to pay special attention to the viability of stablecoins in certain markets.\n\nIn particular, Visa\u2019s efforts to offer stablecoin options may be best suited to emerging market economies where it\u2019s had more difficulty digitizing payments, he said.\n\n\u201cOn the emerging markets use cases, the bulk of those markets around the world are very cash rich markets \u2014 the bulk of those markets around the world are markets where we haven't been as successful digitizing cash as we have in more mature markets,\u201d McInerney told analysts on the webcast in discussing stablecoin opportunities.\n\nSpecifically, he foresees options for shifting payments in stablecoins to transactions on the networks\u2019 array of credit and debit cards in such markets. \u201cTo the extent that stablecoins get adopted in a broad-based way by both consumers and businesses\u201d in such emerging markets, \u201cI think that could accelerate our progress digitizing consumer payments, small business and commercial payments in those markets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Visa strategy on stablecoins is surfacing just days after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act, which begins to create a regulatory framework for the digital assets that are pegged to a currency or commodity that is considered a stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar. While stablecoins are still rarely used in commerce, companies are beginning to see them as potentially useful particularly for cross-border transactions.\n\nStablecoins are often seen as an alternative or bridge to cryptocurrencies. With the proliferation of hundreds of different cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins emerged as alternatives to those more volatile digital assets.\n\nMcInerney expects stablecoins could bolster the company\u2019s cross-border and business-to-business payments plays to make inroads in areas where it hasn\u2019t before. He specifically cited the market for remittances, which are payments sent by migrants working in certain countries, often the U.S., to friends and family in other countries.\n\n\u201cWhether it's remittances or B2B money movement, those are enormous (total addressable markets) that we're still relatively low, in terms of our penetration of those as well,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThat's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to expand and accelerate our growth.\u201d\n\nThe company has generally relied on its international Visa Direct payments network to offer remittances services, but in some cases it hasn\u2019t been as effective, McInerney acknowledged.\n\n\u201cFor example, sending money from a Visa card to a bank account in an emerging market, we're reliant on local banking infrastructure, so in these types of use cases, stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions,\u201d McInerney explained on the webcast.\n\nThe San Francisco-based card network is now testing the use of stablecoins in some such markets versus its other fiat money movement options and pinpointing where the digital assets are most effective, the CEO said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we've got a pretty good sense on which corridors we can provide, faster money movement, cheaper money movement, which ultimately is value, I think, that will accrue both to end users and to our clients,\u201d McInerney said.\n\nThe CEO didn\u2019t specify which markets are being used for those experiments. A spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a question seeking additional information.\n\n\u201cThere is a real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors, and as the largest money movement platform around the world, we're going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end-users.\n\nVisa reported its fiscal third-quarter net income for the month ended June 30, rose 8% over the year-ago period to $5.3 billion as revenue climbed 14% to $10.2 billion, according to the company\u2019s earnings presentation. Payments volume also increased 8%. Profits rose despite a 35% jump in operating expenses, driven by a 26% rise in general and administrative costs and a 23% rise in professional fees, according to the presentation.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s emerging stablecoin solutions should accelerate its (commercial and money movement solutions) business,\u201d analysts at the financial firm William Blair told clients in a Wednesday note. The firm predicted Visa will integrate stablecoin services into its Visa Direct services.",

CEO Ryan McInerney stated these digital currencies are best suited for emerging market economies where digitizing payments has been challenging. Visa foresees stablecoins accelerating its progress in consumer, small business, and commercial payments by facilitating transactions on its credit and debit card networks. The company is actively testing stablecoin usage to enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, especially for remittances and business-to-business money movement.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nVisa's new stablecoin approach could unlock significant growth in markets previously resistant to digital payment adoption, challenging the long-held view of cash dominance. The company acknowledges its past difficulties in digitizing payments in these emerging economies, signaling a strategic shift to overcome these barriers. This strategy aims to bolster Visa's penetration into massive total addressable markets like remittances, where its existing Visa Direct network has been less effective. If successful, stablecoins could provide a competitive advantage by offering a more efficient way to move money across borders.\n\n**The big picture:**\nStablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, offering a less volatile alternative to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Block plans to roll out the feature to all users in the coming months, the company said in a news release Tuesday.

Crucially, the feature uniquely offers interoperability, letting users contribute from Cash App accounts or rival digital wallets from Apple and Google.

New fees could also hamper the growth of cryptocurrency enterprises and \u201crisks the future of fintech, digital assets, and America\u2019s financial innovation and global leadership,\u201d 10 associations wrote last week in a letter seeking President Donald Trump\u2019s help with the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad the CFPB recognized that financial institutions will take advantage of regulatory uncertainty and that consumers must retain the right to access and share access to their own financial data,\u201d Steve Boms, executive director of the Financial Data and Technology Association, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe American Fintech Council \u201cwill work with the CFPB to promote and support a regulatory framework that ensures consumers continue to benefit from products and services that serve their needs by making finance more accessible, transparent, and affordable,\u201d AFC CEO Phil Goldfeder said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, the Kentucky Bankers Association and Forcht Bank sued the CFPB last year to block the rule, arguing that the agency, under the Biden administration, had exceeded its authority, and challenged several aspects of the open banking rule, including its prohibition against assessing fees for data access. The CFPB later, under the Trump administration, adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 view, asking the court to set aside the rule, which it called \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bureau seeks to comprehensively reexamine this matter alongside stakeholders and the broader public to come up with a well-reasoned approach to these complex issues that aligns with the policy preferences of new leadership and addresses the defects in the initial Rule,\u201d the CFPB said in its motion.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the plaintiff banks filed their reply to the FTA\u2019s June 29 motion, reiterating their request for Reeves to set aside the rule.\n\nThe bureau had previously planned to draft a new rule to replace the current rule, a CFPB spokesperson said Tuesday via email, without elaborating. The spokesperson did not respond to questions about which areas of the open banking rule it aims to revise or the anticipated timeframe for that work.\n\nThe open banking rule stems from Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The banks contended in their filing Tuesday that the law requires sensitive financial data to be shared only with consumers, or their representative having \u201ca special, fiduciary-like relationship,\u201d not with third-party companies.\n\nThe CFPB adopted the rule in October. It is set to take effect for the largest banks in mid-2026, with compliance deadlines for other banks layered through 2030. Financial institutions with less than $850 million in assets are exempt from the rule.",

The bureau cited \"recent events in the marketplace\" and a need for \"robust justification\" for the revision.

        "summary_text": "Bilt Technologies, which provides credit cards aimed at rent payments, will revamp its offering next year with its new issuing partner Cardless, pivoting away from its ties to Wells Fargo.\n\nBilt plans to have three cards with Cardless, starting in February, including two new cards with annual fees, as it expands from a single no-fee card, according to a press release earlier this month. The company has sought to build a business offering renters a way to earn loyalty points on their monthly rent payments to landlords.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies declined to discuss how the new cards\u2019 terms or rewards will differ from the Bilt Rewards card Wells Fargo has issued since 2022. The company has promised more details this fall.\n\nThe Wells Fargo card, tied to the Mastercard network, touts an ability to earn reward points on rental payments without a transaction fee. Bilt will move card holders from Wells to Cardless in February 2026, according to the July 10 release.\n\nApartment dwellers typically have not paid their monthly rents with credit or debit cards because of the interchange costs landlords would assume, or pass along to tenants, by accepting card payments. The interchange fee terms under the Bilt-Wells agreement meant the bank relied more on non-rent spending for interchange revenue.\n\nNew York-based Bilt and Wells Fargo found that some cardholders were using the card for their rent and for small charges, like a coffee, to meet a requirement of posting at least five transactions per payment period to earn rewards.\n\nWells Fargo lost as much as $10 million per month on its Bilt card because of such user behaviors, the Wall Street Journal reported in June 2024, citing people familiar with the matter. The bank had predicted that about 65% of spending on the Bilt card would be nonrent, but it turned out that only about 35% of card volumes were for charges not associated with rent, according to the Journal report.\n\nBecause of the financial losses, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo decided to quit its Bilt partnership three years before the 2029 end date, the Journal reported July 10, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment via email. A Bilt spokesperson said the company declined to comment beyond the July 10 press release that detailed the new cards with Cardless and its latest capital raise. San Francisco-based Cardless, a startup that issues cards for companies including Alibaba Group, Qatar Airways and Simon Property Group, also declined to comment.\n\nIn effect, Bilt\u2019s card offered point rewards coupled with a 30-day free loan, or float, on rent payments for people who did not carry a card balance, reducing income for Wells, said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a research publication on the card and payments industry.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not getting enough people who are revolvers to subsidize the portfolio of the people who are just transactors, you\u2019re in trouble, especially on a card that doesn\u2019t have the (annual) fee,\u201d Robertson said Wednesday in an interview, adding \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why (Wells Fargo) made the deal to begin with.\u201d\n\nBilt will need to \u201ctailor the card more to people who use it more broadly and revolve balances to address the revenue shortfall that Wells experienced,\u201d TD Cowen analyst Moshe Orenbuch wrote in a July 23 email.\n\n\u201cWe assume that the new manager of the program will design the products to attract consumers that would be more profitable,\u201d he said.\n\nBilt must become its customers\u2019 default card and earn top-of-wallet use status if the company and its partners want to generate a successful financial return, Robertson said.\n\nBilt, which is valued at $10.75 billion based on a $250 million capital raise this month, said in the July 10 press release that its revenue will top $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. The company says its payment platform includes 25% of U.S. apartment buildings and 40,000 merchants.\n\nBilt\u2019s \u201c2.0\u201d revamp with Cardless represents the company\u2019s foray into a fleet of three tiered card brands. A no-fee card will remain, joined by two cards with annual fees of $95 and $495, respectively. The company is also expanding from rental to mortgage payments, student housing and condominium HOA fees.\n\n\u201cYou have to make the rewards component so compelling that it justifies the $495,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cMaybe the answer to that as a card issuer is in co-partnerships, not cobranding. What kind of deals can you give the cardholder as an incentive for spending that also provide additional value? That might not simply be the bonus points, it might be discounts for you-name-it.\u201d\n\nThe Bilt-Cardless cards enter a landscape of consumer credit cards in which American Express, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase have all recently announced fee and benefit changes to their premium rewards cards.\n\n\u201cYou have Chase and AmEx \u2026 raising their annual fees, but also doubling down again in that very competitive world of trying to find out what\u2019s the most compelling value proposition to generate spending,\u201d Robertson said. One benefit Bilt might realize, he said, is that banks have raised premium card fees to near $800 annually, \u201cso $495 doesn\u2019t look so bad.\u201d\n\nBilt has 22 travel partners for points redemptions, including 17 airlines and five hotel chains. The points can also be redeemed for gift cards at retailers or to pay for Lyft rides.\n\nFormer American Express CEO Ken Chenault joined Bilt as board chairman in January 2024, when General Catalyst, the venture capital firm where he serves as chairman, helped to raise $200 million for Bilt. Roger Goodell, the National Football League commissioner, also joined Bilt\u2019s board last year.\n\nWells Fargo and Mastercard were among Bilt investors when the company announced a $60 million capital raise in September 2021, along with more than a dozen real estate companies.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Bilt Dumps Wells Fargo, Partners Cardless After Bank's Significant Losses\n\n**Key details:**\nBilt Technologies is revamping its credit card offering, moving its issuing partnership from Wells Fargo to Cardless. This pivot includes plans for three new cards with Cardless, starting in February, two of which will have annual fees. Existing Wells Fargo Bilt cardholders will transition to Cardless in February 2026. Wells Fargo ended the partnership three years early due to reported financial losses from the current no-fee card. More details on the new cards' terms or rewards are promised this fall.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis partnership change highlights significant financial challenges in Bilt's previous no-fee card model, as Wells Fargo reportedly lost up to $10 million monthly. The problem stemmed from cardholders primarily using it for rent, with non-rent spending far below projections. This challenges the initial consensus that a no-fee rent-focused card could be profitable for an issuer, suggesting the previous model was unsustainable. The new cards with annual fees aim to attract more profitable users who revolve balances and use the card more broadly, which is critical for Bilt's financial success.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBilt Technologies has aimed to allow renters to earn loyalty points on monthly rent payments, an area typically avoided by credit cards due to interchange costs. The previous Bilt-Wells Fargo model struggled because cardholders predominantly used it for rent, leading to insufficient non-rent spending and significant losses for Wells Fargo. This meant Wells Fargo provided a de facto free loan for rent payments without sufficient revenue from revolving balances. Bilt is expanding its payment platform beyond rent to include mortgages, student housing, and HOA fees.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Wells Fargo lost up to $10 million per month on its Bilt card.\n*   Only 35% of Bilt card volumes were non-rent charges, far below the 65% prediction.\n*   Wells Fargo ended its Bilt partnership three years before its 2029 end date.\n*   Bilt is valued at $10.75 billion, based on a $250 million capital raise this month.\n*   Bilt projects its revenue will exceed $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Bilt Technologies:** Revamping its rent payment credit card offering, shifting from Wells Fargo to Cardless.\n*   **Cardless:** New issuing partner for Bilt's credit cards, launching three new products.\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Former Bilt card issuer, exited partnership early due to reported monthly losses.\n*   **David Robertson:** Nilson Report publisher, analyzed Bilt's financial model and issuer profitability.\n*   **Moshe Orenbuch:** TD Cowen analyst, suggested Bilt attract more profitable consumers with new products.\n*   **Ken Chenault:** Former AmEx CEO, joined Bilt as board chairman in January 2024.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   More details on the new Bilt-Cardless cards' terms and rewards are promised this fall.\n*   The new Bilt-Cardless cards are scheduled to launch in February.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nBilt pivots with new cards, aiming for profitability after partner's losses.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nStarbucks is maintaining its emphasis on customer experience, with an eye toward operations, as it pursues a turnaround.\n\nThe Back to Starbucks plan, which was introduced in September 2024 and grounded in customer and associate feedback, remains the right strategy for the job, according to CEO Brian Niccol. In-store customer experience plays a key role in the turnaround effort.\n\n\u201cWe are building a better Starbucks, where everyone can experience the best of Starbucks, one that is stronger, more resilient and consistently growing, a Starbucks that is once again the gold standard in customer service, partner experience, the coffeehouse experience and financial performance,\u201d Niccol said on a fiscal Q3 2025 earnings call Tuesday.\n\nStarbucks still has work to do. Global comparable store sales fell 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2025, according to a company earnings report. Total net revenue rose 4% year over year to $9.5 billion.\n\nExecutives say that the company is on the right track, and that efforts like the Green Apron Service model are setting the stage for improvements to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fixing the operational foundations of the business and building a platform for innovation in 2026,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cSome of the changes are already visible while others will be seen in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nExecutives shared Starbucks\u2019 CX wins and fresh initiatives on the company\u2019s third quarter 2025 earnings call. Here are four major takeaways:\n\n1. Experience investments are showing promise\n\nWhile Starbucks\u2019 comparable sales are still trending downward, customer perceptions of the experience are on the upswing, according to Niccol.\n\nCustomers are taking notice of improvements to speed, hospitality and accuracy at Starbucks locations, according to Niccol. Customer connection scores are up and customer complaints are down quarter over quarter and year over year, while the brand\u2019s value perceptions are at near two-year highs.\n\nThe company is seeing gains among Gen Z and millennial customers, who make up over half of Starbucks\u2019 base, according to Niccol. Transaction growth from non-Starbucks Rewards members also rose year over year.\n\nStarbucks is adopting a growth scorecard to help the company keep track of the metrics that will drive its future financial performance.\n\n\u201cIt's about the customer,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cIt's about our being staffed correctly. It's about ensuring that we obviously get the right speed requirements hit. And so when we do those things, we see the outcomes that we want, which is transaction growth which then ultimately, I think, is a key indicator of health in the business.\u201d\n\n2. Four-minute handoffs remain a priority\n\nOne of the biggest challenges at Starbucks in recent years has been wait times, driven by the popularity of mobile ordering \u2014 which was slowing down in-person and drive-thru customers.\n\nNiccol made getting mobile orders under control a top priority and set the goal of fulfilling in-person orders within four minutes and mobile orders in no more than 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nEfforts like better order sequencing have helped speed up drink making, and average peak drive-thru times are at three minutes and 20 seconds at the 7,600 locations with drive-thrus, according to Niccol.\n\nStarbucks will maintain its commitment to four-minute handoffs as it rolls out new processes, according to Niccol. \u201cOne of the principles for our innovation is it cannot negatively impact our ability to deliver on cafe orders in less than four minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is using Green Apron Service to prepare it to implement innovations without slowing down the customer experience, according to Niccol. The model is expected to help Starbucks make further changes while minimizing the impact on baristas.\n\n3. CX benefits have a ramp up time\n\nGreen Apron Service, slated to start expanding across company-operated U.S. locations in August, is being rolled out ahead of schedule, according to Niccol.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal is to have the model in place ahead of pumpkin spice season, according to Niccol. While cafes with Green Apron Service saw improvements to metrics including sales and customer service times, they didn\u2019t manifest immediately.\n\nGreen Apron Service includes adding more employee hours, and it \u201ctakes a little bit of time for us to get into a rhythm with the new labor that we have on the team,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cAnd that also takes a little bit of time for our customers to recognize that they're getting a different kind of service experience.\u201d\n\nHowever, once established, locations using Green Apron Service show good results, according to Niccol. He noted that customers appreciate the better experience, and he expects the positive trends to continue improving.\n\nMany customers come into Starbucks for pumpkin spice season, \"and now they're going to experience Green Apron Service,\" Niccol said. \"And I just think that's a winning proposition for us that sets the table for what's to come in 2026.\u201d\n\n4. Loyalty is still growing\n\nStarbucks Rewards has nearly 34 million 90-day active members, and Starbucks plans to continue evolving the loyalty program to keep them coming back.\n\nPlans include a new Starbucks app, enhancements to mobile order and new pay options \u201cthat will further improve our ability to deliver a great customer experience at pickup,\u201d Niccol said. The company plans to address customer feedback with its updates.\n\nOne of Starbucks\u2019 goals is to continue growing non-discounted transactions with loyalty members, according to Niccol. That number is on the rise quarter over quarter, but Niccol sees more work to do, noting that the rewards program has put too much emphasis on discounts.\n\n\u201cAnd the feedback we've gotten from customers that are part of it is, if I'm a really big loyal customer, I think there should be more recognition of that,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cAnd if I'm a less frequent customer, we should then set up the program so that it fits for them.\u201d\n\nStarbucks plans to tailor the program to be more about recognizing loyalty and engagement, according to Niccol. The company expects to reveal more information in February 2026.",

        "summary": "**Starbucks Eyes Turnaround with Customer Experience Focus Amid Sales Dip**\n\n**Key details:**\nStarbucks is pursuing a turnaround with its \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, introduced in September 2024, focusing on in-store customer experience. This includes efforts to improve speed, hospitality, and accuracy, leading to an upswing in customer perceptions. The company is rolling out its Green Apron Service model, which adds employee hours, across U.S. company-operated locations starting in August. Starbucks is also evolving its loyalty program, Starbucks Rewards, with a new app and pay options to address customer feedback.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhile global comparable store sales fell 2% year over year in Q3 2025, total net revenue rose 4% to $9.5 billion. This challenges a purely negative view of the company\u2019s performance, as customer connection scores are up and complaints are down. Brand value perceptions are at near two-year highs, and transaction growth from non-Starbucks Rewards members rose year over year. These improving customer and operational metrics suggest the company believes it is laying the groundwork for future financial performance despite current comparable sales declines.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe \"Back to Starbucks\" plan aims for the company to become \"stronger, more resilient and consistently growing,\" restoring its \"gold standard\" in service and finance. A significant past challenge has been wait times, particularly from mobile ordering. Starbucks has prioritized four-minute in-person order handoffs and 12-15 minute mobile order fulfillment. Initiatives like the Green Apron Service model are designed to fix operational foundations and build a platform for innovation in 2026 without compromising customer experience.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Global comparable store sales: -2% year over year in fiscal Q3 2025.\n*   Total net revenue: $9.5 billion, up 4% year over year.\n*   Starbucks Rewards: Nearly 34 million 90-day active members.\n*   Average peak drive-thru times: 3 minutes 20 seconds at 7,600 locations.\n*   Customer value perceptions: Near two-year highs.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Starbucks:** Pursuing a turnaround strategy focused on enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency.\n*   **Brian Niccol:** CEO, states the \"Back to Starbucks\" plan is the correct strategy for the company's turnaround.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Green Apron Service model is slated to start expanding across company-operated U.S. locations in August, ahead of pumpkin spice season.\n*   Starbucks expects to reveal more information on its evolved loyalty program in February 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nStarbucks balances current sales dip with operational improvements, eyeing future growth.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWingstop has installed the Wingstop Smart Kitchen, a new kitchen operating system, in 1,000 restaurants, with full deployment across its U.S. system expected by the end of the year, CEO Micheal Skipworth said Wednesday on the chain\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call.\n\nRestaurants with the Wingstop Smart Kitchen have seen a 40% reduction in ticket times within four weeks of implementation. \u201cMarkets with the Wingstop Smart Kitchen are delivering faster speed, a more consistent guest experience and sales outperformance, and all of this without additional advertising to the guests,\u201d Skipworth said.\n\nThese kitchen changes will likely help bolster comparable sales, which fell 1.9% in Q2 2025, the first decline reported by the fast casual chain since Q2 2022. Skipworth said that the comps were up against strong sales growth of 28.4% in the year-ago quarter and 16.8% in Q2 2023.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nRestaurants with Smart Kitchens, including the initial 160 stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth test market, reported \u201cmeaningfully higher same-store sales growth relative to control restaurants,\u201d Skipworth said.\n\nThe new KDS includes four touch-screen monitors and uses predictive order management, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a June 30 report detailing a restaurant tour. The system offers greater operational precision. For example, the KDS displays how many ounces of fries need to be cooked, an improvement on employees guessing portions, Saleh said. The system uses a restaurant\u2019s existing servers and tech stack, and can be installed overnight and enabled the next day.\n\nTicket times in modernized kitchens are down to about 10 minutes, compared to 18 to 22 minutes \u201con our best days,\u201d Skipworth said, adding that it takes restaurants about four weeks to acclimate to the new system and hit these ticket times. These restaurants also have seen an eight-point increase in guest satisfaction scores compared to restaurants without a Smart Kitchen, he added.\n\nWingstop Smart Kitchen is also decreasing delivery times, which sometimes exceeded 40 minutes and frustrated customers, Skipworth said. Delivery times are now under 30 minutes for third-party delivery.\n\n\u201cWe believe the faster service times will be a key component to bridge the gap from 30% to 50% delivery mix, as customers on delivery apps can sort by criteria like fastest near them and delivery within 30 minutes, so Wingstop can now be in those consideration sets,\u201d Saleh said.\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, year-over-year sales growth is already outpacing U.S. delivery sales by mid-single digits.\n\n\u201cThe results we are seeing from the Wingstop Smart Kitchen are exactly what we had anticipated and are validating the opportunities we have within our strategies supporting our long term target of scaling AUVs to $3 million,\u201d Skipworth said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWayback Burgers\u2019 franchisor wants to redefine what it means to be a multi-brand franchisee. On Thursday, it unveiled Hubspoke Brands, a franchising platform that supports multi-brand ownership within the fast casual segment. Jake\u2019s Franchising, the franchisor of Wayback Burgers, also rebranded as Wayback Franchising, the company said in an emailed press release.\n\nHubspoke Brands currently offers six concepts, including Molte Pizze, giving franchisees the opportunity to expand into different brands without changing franchisors.\n\n\u201cIt makes it easier from an operational perspective. [For some multi-brand franchisees], the back offices are different at all the brands, the requirements are different, and we can bring it all under one [company] and make it more efficient for them,\u201d John Eucalitto, Wayback Franchising CEO, said.\n\nWayback Franchising opened the first Hubspoke Kitchen over a year ago, a company-owned unit that houses six brands and prepares meals in an off-premise-focused space in Connecticut. The next version of Hubspoke Kitchen will contain indoor seating, going along with the trend of customers returning to dine-in.\n\nMore On Hubspoke Brands Molte Pizze: The concept offers crispy tavern-style, foldable New York and cheesy, caramelized Detroit pizzas. Pane & Mozz: The brand offers focaccia sandwiches with meats, cheeses and toppings as well as hot sides like tots and fries, salads and wings. Taculto: A taco, burrito and bowl concept. Citta Pasta: The brand offers scratch-made pasta dishes, salads, wings and Italian-style side dishes. Uncle Willie\u2019s Smokehouse: The barbecue concept offers slow-smoked meats and Southern sides like mac and cheese, baked beans, and corn bread with honey butter.\n\nRenaming the franchisor and expanding its brands was years in the making, Eucalitto said, adding that planning began in 2018, but the COVID-19 pandemic put this work on hold.\n\nThe new platform and the sister brands don\u2019t mean Wayback Burgers is slowing down its current growth rate. Wayback Burgers, which has about 180 units, has roughly 15 stores currently under construction. It expects 10 to 25 units to open in 2025, which could push its unit count to 200 by year's end.\n\nWith Wayback Burgers growing post-pandemic, Eucalitto and his team decided to pull the trigger on the new brand platform. Franchisees have been growing in the last five years, but through M&A, private equity or other means, but Eucalitto said he wants to offer another way for growth.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t aspire to do that. We aspire to continue to grow and help our staff and our franchisees grow, but see how we can do it better,\u201d Eucalitto said.\n\nA Detroit-style pizza from Molte Pizze Permission granted by Wayback Franchising\n\nGrowing Hubspoke Brands\n\nThe Hubspoke Kitchen concept, which is also under the Hubspoke Brands platform, is designed for experienced operators rather than first-time franchisees, Eucalitto said. The company\u2019s variety of brands can benefit multi-branded operators who may have sold out a concept in particular territory and are looking to other concepts for growth. It can potentially open up new real estate options too, especially in shopping centers, where there may be competing brands. Hubspoke\u2019s roster of brands means operators can shift to a different brand that won\u2019t face intense sales competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d pivot to something else to better compete if we needed to, because that\u2019s how Hubspoke is supposed to be,\u201d Eucalitto said, adding that he expects Hubspoke to expand from six brands to 10 to 12.\n\nHubspoke expects its multi-brand units to show strong volume and controllable food and labor costs. At the Hubspoke Kitchen in Wallingford, Connecticut, each brand has its own station to test its performance with just two or three employees. Wayback Franchising is testing the brands outside the Hubspoke model to measure performance.\n\nSo far, the company feels like its Molte Pizza and Pane & Mozz brands are ready to standalone after being proven within Hubspoke Kitchen.\n\nThe company is already building out three co-branded concepts, one of which, a Molte Pizza and a Wayback Burgers in New Jersey, is opening next week. It has more co-branded locations forthcoming in Bridgeport and Orange, Connecticut, both of which are owned by a multi-unit, multi-brand franchisee, Eucalitto said. A standalone Pane and Mozz will also open near the existing Hubspoke Kitchen in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Hubspoke Kitchen model as a market/restaurant/multi-branded or multi-menu mix concept will last \u2026 We have to focus on making every individual brand and the product and the systems as best as we possibly can, so that they can stand on their own,\u201d Eucalitto.\n\nHubspoke Kitchens can also be used to test new menu items. For example, the company came up with an ice cream parfait for Wayback within a Hubspoke Kitchen as a way to save leftover cookies that would otherwise go to waste. This is the top selling item in the Hubspoke Kitchen, he said, adding that the parfaits will be rolled out to Wayback Burgers in September or October.\n\nA double bacon cheeseburger from Wayback Burgers Permission granted by Wayback Franchising\n\nWayback Burgers remains key brand\n\nWayback has been focusing on improving back office operations and getting systems in place to support franchisees, like up-to-date data and reporting, Eucalitto said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot lose sight of Wayback [Burgers]. That is the most important brand for us,\u201d Eucalitto said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t exist, we wouldn\u2019t be here. We have to continue with it. We know we can do much better with it.\u201d\n\nWayback realigned and expanded its corporate team this past year to ensure that leaders were in the right place doing what they do best, Eucalitto said.\n\nFrom a technology perspective, the company improved how it communicates key metrics and sales data to operators. Franchisees typically see daily sales reports from their own point-of-sales systems as well as from corporate, which sends daily journals and recommendations on different sales drivers. This has helped cut down the time needed to reconcile POS data from nearly an hour to five minutes.\n\nThe company, which has done very little advertising since the COVID-19 pandemic started, also said it would collect 2% local marketing fee and spend it with franchisees, which it hasn\u2019t done before: Wayback previously left marketing to franchisees. Regions will now pool their resources for marketing in addition to national marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cWe're very conservative, we're very slow and methodical, but we do everything we possibly can to help because we only have that one customer,\u201d Eucalitto said. \u201cAnd that's the franchisees.\u201d",

A focus on the brand\u2019s identity and premium menu items could help the chain take occasions from QSR burger brands, which have struggled to grow same-store sales as pricing pressure has eroded QSR\u2019s traditional value edge over both casual dining and fast casual competitors. Chili\u2019s, in particular, has seen its efforts to contrast its burgers with fast food drive astronomical traffic growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making these investments because we do believe that they will drive sales and margin expansion, but that is not in the guidance today,\u201d Fogerty said.",

CEO Rob Lynch announced a strategic shift to increase paid media ad spend, departing from their previous word-of-mouth marketing. CFO Katie Fogerty noted early ad spending would support promotions like the Dubai Chocolate Shake. Test results for paid media are positive, though not yet included in the Q2 earnings report.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis new ad spend aims to drive sales and margin expansion, but these anticipated benefits are not included in the current financial guidance. The strategy challenges the previous word-of-mouth marketing consensus, suggesting a significant shift in how the company expects to grow. By focusing on brand identity and premium items, Shake Shack seeks to take market share from struggling QSR burger brands. This move could challenge the view that Shake Shack relies solely on organic buzz for growth, introducing a new variable not yet factored into analyst models.\n\n**The big picture:**\nShake Shack historically relied solely on word-of-mouth, earned media, and bottom-of-funnel promotions for marketing. The company is now moving to launch paid media advertising at scale, a significant strategic departure. This shift aims to capitalize on core operations and limited-time menu success.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStarbucks is building a menu innovation pipeline composed of premium coffee options, non-coffee drinks and artisanal food, CEO Brian Niccol said on the chain\u2019s fiscal Q3 earnings call .\n\nMany of the brand\u2019s menu additions will have significant protein content, or other nutritional features designed to appeal to health-conscious consumers. For example, Niccol said the chain will introduce a protein Cold Foam customization.\n\nStarting next year, the chain will launch a new baked goods case, a new variety of dark roast coffee and other menu changes, with a particular focus on experiential drinks and afternoon snacks, Niccol said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSome of Starbucks\u2019 food innovations could come from tests in other markets. Canada has been a strong food market for the chain in recent months, selling pancakes and waffles and will begin to serve bagel bites soon, Niccol said. Food innovation is helping to drive same-store sales growth.\n\n\u201cThere is [an] opportunity for us to figure out what they\u2019re doing up in Canada from a food standpoint to figure out what makes sense for us to bring not only to the U.S. but around the world,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nFrom a drinks standpoint, Starbucks will test alternatives, such as coconut water-based tea and coffee drinks in select markets, Niccol said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lean into customer needs with upcoming tests of gluten-free and high-protein options to create food that\u2019s as artisanal as our beverages,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nThe combined focus on ingredients, like coconut water and added protein, place Starbucks\u2019 new strategy squarely within the major menu trends in restaurants. Premium coffee concepts that focus on on-premise experiences are doing well, while consumers are looking for healthy-seeming inclusions, like protein and fruit, in new drinks.\n\nSimultaneously, the growth of caffeinated beverages other than coffee is creating new daypart opportunities. With QSR chains like McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands focusing on new drinks development, Starbucks may be looking to preserve its position as a go-to beverage chain from new entrants seeking to capitalize on shifting consumer sentiment.\n\nStarbucks is standardizing its menu test process by rolling out new items in five stores, a shift the chain calls the Starting 5.\n\nNiccol said the aim of the Starting 5 is to ensure \u201cinnovation is being co-built with our baristas in our stores, versus we build it in the support center, we throw it over the wall, and we hope that our baristas can figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe coffee giant will do its menu development in conjunction with its field teams and baristas from now on in an effort to prevent new drinks and additions \u2014 like the protein Cold Foam \u2014 from adding unnecessary operational complexity.\n\nThat Cold Foam will come with 15 grams of protein per serving in Q4. Sales of the original Cold Foam modifiers rose 23% year over year.\n\nNiccol said that during the protein Cold Foam development process, Starbucks \u201ctapped into our baristas to help us fine-tune the program so that it\u2019s executed in a way that can be a great drink every time on the speed requirements that our customers expect.\u201d\n\nThe menu additions follow a campaign of simplification earlier this year that, when it was announced, was forecast to trim about 30% of the chain\u2019s menu. Niccol said that simplification was necessary to reduce the labor demands of the menu and free up space for new menu items.",

Wiederhorn, Fat Brands' current board chairman, was indicted in May 2024 for an alleged $47 million loan scheme. The Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Wiederhorn, and that lawsuit may now be dropped after being stayed. Fat Brands stated Wiederhorn and his team consistently argued his innocence, claiming no criminal conduct, victims, or financial losses.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe dismissal removes a significant legal cloud that has been over Fat Brands and its board chairman since the indictment. This outcome supports Wiederhorn's consistent claims of innocence as described by Fat Brands. It directly challenges any prior consensus view that anticipated a conviction or continued legal battles for the company's leadership. This may allow the company to focus on its stated goal of \"continued growth and success\" without the ongoing burden of these specific criminal proceedings.\n\n**The big picture:**\nInvestigations by the SEC and DOJ into Wiederhorn began in 2022, when they started requesting documents from Fat Brands. The grand jury indictment against Wiederhorn concerning the alleged loan scheme was issued in May 2024.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nYum Brands knows, years ahead of time, which flavors it will pursue for beverage innovation. This strategic foresight is made possible by two factors, said Yum Brands Chief Marketing Officer Ken Muench.\n\nFirst, Muench said, fast food is near the end of the cultural adoption cycle for most flavor trends \u2014 brands have to appeal to a wide range of consumers, and they\u2019re constantly chasing flavors that are well known but still on the upswing. In other words, these chains seek the most advanced, yet acceptable ideas, Muench said. Second is a 35-person unit within Yum, called Collider Labs, that monitors consumer trends across major markets in real time.\n\n\u201cOur entire job is to look at where culture is going, look at where consumers are headed and then inform the brands. And we do that years ahead of time,\u201d Muench said. \u201cIt's probably the largest beverage database in the world.\u201d\n\nThat database has allowed Yum to understand the shifting landscape of consumer preference, identify where trends are coming from, and intervene in menu strategies to position restaurants to take advantage of these trends.\n\nThe QSR beverage opportunity is growing\n\nOne trend of particular importance to Yum is the expansion of the kind of drinks consumers are willing to buy from QSRs, Muench said. Collider identified how consumer acceptance of beverage types was changing, and communicated that to Yum\u2019s constituent brands.\n\nFor KFC, that meant looking into lemonades, refreshers, milkshakes and iced coffee as development opportunities, said Val Kubizniak, KFC\u2019s chief marketing officer. The pace of beverage development is attractive and advantageous to brands, she said. Kubizniak said that the nature of beverage development offers advantages for brands.\n\n\u201cDeveloping products like new burgers or new tenders takes time,\u201d Kubizniak said. \u201cBut beverages can be quite a fast space to play in once you're working with the right suppliers.\u201d\n\nMuench said QSR coffee drinks are on the cusp of that \u201cmost advanced, yet accepted status,\u201d because consumers have begun to favor cold, convenience and visual appearance over hot and on-premise coffee experiences in the last decade and a half.\n\nSuch structural trends have resulted in drinks like Taco Bell\u2019s Churros Chillers and Coffee Chillers. Muench said the company is looking at a variety of wider coffee options.\n\n\u201cWhether it's cold coffee, cold brew, varieties of coffee with bubbles in it, with inclusions in it, with a cream top, a foam top, all that sort of stuff, is a super interesting area that was never open to QSRs before,\u201d Muench said.\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s refreshers, called refrescas, are a prime example of the expanding QSR beverage opportunities. Courtesy of Taco Bell\n\nCold coffee and blended coffee beverages don\u2019t require the same degree of equipment as hot espresso drinks, which are still a no-go for Taco Bell and KFC consumers, Muench said.\n\n\u201cThere's some things that intuitively don't work. Hot coffee and Mexican food doesn't work for Americans yet,\u201d Muench said. \u201cHot coffee and fried chicken, at least in Western countries, [is] also a weird thing.\u201d\n\nOther beverages like iced teas, lemonades and various refreshers present clearer, easier opportunities for Yum Brands to adopt. And Yum\u2019s standard for acceptability is quite high.\n\n\u201cQSRs in the U.S. reach 95% of consumers,\u201d Muench said. \u201cIf it's just applicable to 10% it's not interesting. If it's just applicable to 30% to 40%, it's not really interesting. If it's applicable to 50%, now you're starting to get to a place where, okay, maybe this is something we should then expand.\u201d\n\nHow do preference changes become new drinks?\n\nBeverage trends often start in higher end, experiential restaurant concepts or in markets outside the U.S., Muench said.\n\n\u201cBasically, if it's catching on in South Korea, it's going to catch on anywhere in the world. That's the shorthand,\u201d Muench said. The political economy of South Korea, which has limited socio-economic mobility, encourages younger consumers to compete to be trendy, according to Muench.\n\nYum collects drink ideas from particularly innovative regions. Then Collider works with the brands to host innovation sessions, which can result in up to 150 ideas.\n\nThe next step is less intuitive: Yum uses prediction markets to assess a narrow range of drink options. These sorts of markets use betting data to assess the likelihood of given outcomes. The most famous such market is PredictIt, which allows individuals to events like the 2025 New York Mayoral race.\n\nYum asks consumers to bet on which drinks, out of a slate of 10, are likely to be the most successful, Muench said. The theory behind this strategy is that a large group of people \u2014 Yum asks upwards of 500 consumers in each country it assesses \u2014 are good at predicting what in aggregate might be popular, rather than what they, individually, might enjoy drinking.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in college, you know before your roommate knows that he's going to break up with his girlfriend,\u201d Muench said. \u201cWe are much better predictors of other people\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\nYum asks consumers to predict a variety of outcomes, both long-term popularity and short-term buzz, which helps offset conservative estimates. Buzzy items with a lower predicted popularity can make good candidates for limited trials, Muench said. Short-form video social media platforms shortened the time it takes a drink to go from a fringe option to something a broad swath of consumers clamor for. Successful drinks ideas in prediction markets then go through Yum\u2019s flavor testing and design process to refine and finalize ingredients.\n\nA view of a KFC restaurant on July 10, 2024 in Vallejo, California. Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\n\nA Case Study: KFC\n\nGiven Yum\u2019s scale, it\u2019s worth looking at how one brand is integrating beverage insights from Collider into its menu and development strategy. KFC, which has seen dramatic international growth at the same time as its sales have eroded in the U.S., has a particularly important beverage innovation pipeline.\n\nThe insights generated by Collider\u2019s efforts and the speed with which drinks can be developed make the question of new menu development an operations question, rather than an ideas question, Kubizniak said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for us is how do we \u2026 bring it to life in our restaurants,\u201d Kubizniak said.\n\nThat\u2019s a challenge the brand has been working to overcome in the U.K., where it launched a premium, beverage-focused QSR brand \u2014 called Kwench by KFC \u2014 in 38 restaurants earlier this year. Kwench also has a presence in Australia.\n\nThe Kwench set up will require a coffee machine, milkshake machine and a back-of-house set up called the Kwench bench, Kubizniak said. Because the concept and the drinks are new, they will also entail a fair amount of employee training.\n\nBut early results have been encouraging. Customers have responded well to Kwench\u2019s menu lineup, particularly its crunchy milkshakes,and franchisees are excited about the beverage program. Texture plays a big role in distinguishing drinks, Kubizniak said.\n\nSome of the Kwench drinks, refreshers and lemonades, are good companions for fried chicken, but others could draw consumers on their own.\n\n\u201cMilkshakes and coffees \u2014 the more indulgent flavors \u2014 they're really a standalone purchase,\u201d Kubizniak. \u201c\u2018Come for the beverage, stay for the chicken,\u2019 is the mantra.\u201d\n\nKwench, Kubizniak said, will be a larger initiative, rather than a way to test individual drinks. But adding a new beverage program across the brand\u2019s franchise system requires finding the right equipment, formalizing a supply chain, determining the appropriate pricing, securing franchisee buy-in and ensuring all of this can be done in existing real estate. The U.K. and Australia will see significant expansions next year.\n\n\u201cWe have more tests planned in Mexico and South Africa and Poland, and then also, hopefully, in the U.S. this year,\u201d Kubizniak said.\n\nBut the U.S. market, where the brand has struggled to compete in recent years, will require other efforts before new beverages become a priority, Kubizniak said.",

This strategic foresight allows the company to identify consumer trends years ahead of time, positioning its restaurant brands for growth. Beverages offer a faster development cycle compared to food items like burgers or tenders, presenting an attractive opportunity. KFC, a Yum brand, is expanding its beverage strategy through \"Kwench by KFC\" in the UK and Australia, exploring new options.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis data-driven approach provides Yum Brands with early insight into consumer preferences, potentially driving future revenue streams. The faster beverage development cycle enables quick adaptation to market shifts and capitalizing on emerging trends. KFC's \"Kwench\" initiative aims to draw consumers for beverages, with the mantra \"come for the beverage, stay for the chicken,\" potentially boosting overall sales. This strategy challenges the traditional Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) model where beverages are often secondary, indicating a significant shift towards leveraging them as primary sales drivers.\n\n**The big picture:**\nYum Brands employs Collider Labs to monitor real-time consumer trends across major markets. This unit's job is to look at where culture and consumers are headed to inform brands years in advance.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAdditions to fast-food menus rarely get six months to build buzz, but that was not the case with the return of Snack Wraps to McDonald\u2019s. The chain\u2019s U.S. president Joe Erlinger confirmed the return of the cult favorite item, which was removed from most U.S. locations in 2016, in December 2024, kicking off months of hype from fans and the brand.\n\nBut McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t alone. In an attempt to hijack the conversation and beat the Golden Arches to the punch, Popeyes on June 2 announced the addition of Chicken Wraps to its menu, offering \u201ca whole lot of flavor without breaking the bank.\u201d\n\nSince then, the marketing \u2014 and competitive sparring \u2014 has continued, with Taco Bell getting into the chicken wrap game and KFC, Wingstop and even White Castle doubling down on marketing around chicken. These efforts demonstrate how QSRs continue to market the protein, years after the so-called chicken sandwich wars reinvigorated the category.\n\n\"Our foot traffic data indicates that while value is important, innovation is equally relevant to QSR consumers when making purchase decision,\u201d said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, in emailed comments. \u201cOver the past few years, chicken has been a major source of innovation across the QSR category, from new chicken strip offerings to, more recently, various snack wrap options.\u201d\n\nLovin\u2019 nostalgia\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s, the power of innovation is in the data. On the day of Snack Wrap\u2019s return (July 10), visits to the chain were up 15%, compared to the year-to-date average, with visits on July 11 increasing 22.3% compared to the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe Snack Wrap\u2019s successful comeback is the latest example of a revived product finding success, reinforcing the power of nostalgia in today\u2019s QSR limited-time offers,\u201d Hottovy told Marketing Dive\u2019s sister publication Restaurant Dive.\n\nTo market the return of the Snack Wrap, McDonald\u2019s leaned into that nostalgia, as it has with everything from a sales-lifting celebration of Grimace\u2019s birthday to Happy Meals, McNugget Buddies and collector cups. The brand launched a throwback web portal to hype the return, extending the campaign with a TV spot, social posts, out-of-home ads and a Snapchat activation.\n\nBut the chain is also using the return of the Snack Wrap to take its marketing forward. The chain recently appointed Translation as its new agency of record for the African American consumer market. To reach that market, the agency created an \u201cUnc\u201d character, played by Hassan Johnson (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), who features in ads that co-sign the Snack Wrap for a generation of consumers who weren\u2019t around during the product\u2019s heyday.\n\nTranslation has worked with McDonald\u2019s before, on the creation of the iconic \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d jingle and a \u201cThink with Your Mouth\u201d Big Mac campaign. Moving forward, the brand and agency hope to deliver more insight-led, culturally informed campaigns, per a statement.\n\nChicken wars continue\n\nIn its efforts to needle McDonald\u2019s, Popeyes looked to instigate a full-blown \u201cwrap battle\u201d with what it billed as the first-ever artificial intelligence-generated diss track music video. The chain partnered with creator PJ Accetturo for a video that featured \u2014 among other things \u2014 a Popeyes party, a knight in shining armor and a depressed, fast-food-slinging clown.\n\n\u201cMore than just a brand video, this marks a shift in how fast food connects with fans: not through polished ads, but through collaborative creativity,\u201d a brand spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPopeyes was not alone in getting into the so-called wrap wars. Taco Bell built on its launch of a crispy chicken nuggets product with crispy chicken burritos and tacos \u2014 the latter resembling a snack wrap, by any other name. The products are part of a full, permanent crispy-chicken platform that will roll out by 2026.\n\n\u201cCrispy chicken is having a moment, but our fans made it a movement,\u201d said Taco Bell CMO Taylor Montgomery, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not like every other chicken spot out there, we\u2019re doing crispy chicken the only way we know how: full of flavor and unmistakably Taco Bell.\u201d\n\nTo connect with fans around culture, Taco Bell took to Cameo to cast a wide net of brand ambassadors, from actress Kate Flannery (\u201cThe Office\u201d), rapper-actor GaTa and celebrity chef Christian Petroni for the new crispy chicken products. The chain also began running an ad wherein a consumer ponders the unlikely pairing of a \u201cCrispy Chicken From a Taco Place.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more unlikely than crispy chicken from a taco place is crispy chicken from the world\u2019s first fast-food hamburger chain. Yet White Castle on June 30 launched a Crispy Chicken Slider alongside branded merch and a $5 combo only available to rewards members. Loyalty plays have increased as restaurant chains look to entice cash-strapped consumers during an uncertain economic period.\n\nChicken chain bona fides\n\nWhile many in the QSR space are focused on snack wraps, other chicken-focused chains are ramping up marketing, as well. KFC this month looked to enter its \u201ccomeback era\u201d with a multipart campaign that features both a spot co-starring celebrity chef and actor Matty Matheson and a push to make founder-mascot Colonel Sanders more serious. The campaign, \u201cThe Colonel Lived So We Could Chicken,\u201d looks to right the ship after a period of U.S. sales declines amid increased competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of the latest fried chicken rankings and I\u2019m fired up to launch a bold Kentucky Fried Comeback and remind America exactly who we are,\u201d said Catherine Tan-Gillespie, president of KFC U.S., in a statement. \u201cIf people can give their ex a million second chances, I hope our fans can give us one.\u201d\n\nAmong KFC\u2019s major competitors is Wingstop, which saw 41% growth in consumer spend in 2024 \u2014 the largest gain among the top 50 restaurant chains \u2014 according to Circana data. The chain has been an active marketer as of late, teaming with WNBA star Paige Bueckers for a celebrity meal reminiscent of those offered by McDonald\u2019s Famous Orders platform. Wingstop also looked to make their dominance in chicken official, filing an application to register the \u201cNational Chicken Tender Day\u201d trademark.\n\n\u201cSome say that chicken fingers, strips and tenders are the same, but Wingstop isn't buying it,\u201d said Mark Christenson, Wingstop's chief revenue officer, in a press release. \u201cBy filing a trademark application to register 'National Chicken Tender Day,' Wingstop is giving the finger to fingers and staking our claim on our distinctive crispy tenders that fans crave.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAdidas is set to steal market share from Nike this year as its rival navigates a turnaround and a tariff-fueled economy. That\u2019s according to a GlobalData analysis, which sees Adidas as one of the biggest winners in the global apparel market in 2025.\n\nLast year, Nike held 2.9% of the global apparel market, 1.1 percentage points higher than Adidas. In 2025, that\u2019s expected to decline by 0.3 percentage points, at the same time that Adidas\u2019 share grows by 0.1 percentage point.\n\nOther share gainers in apparel this year will be Shein, Uniqlo, Skechers and New Balance, according to GlobalData\u2019s forecast. Puma, which just reported a Q2 sales decline and slashed its full-year forecast due to tariffs and soft sales trends, is expected to lose share, alongside H&M and Louis Vuitton.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe upheaval caused by the Trump administration\u2019s ever-changing tariff policies is impacting all retailers in one way or another, though apparel is one of the hardest-hit sectors. Within that segment, retailers are raising prices and shifting production to cut down on costs, all while navigating a wary consumer.\n\n\u201cBrands that can quickly react to trends and offer good value for money will have the opportunity to gain share, whereas those that are unable to compete on price or style are forecast to lose out,\u201d Tom Ljubojevic, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement.\n\nStyle is one of the reasons Adidas is forecast to win, with GlobalData citing the success of its Originals line and performance footwear in the current environment. Adidas just this week reported sales growth of 2% in Q2 and said it expects style preferences to continue to work in its favor. Nike, on the other hand, is struggling under the weight of lackluster innovation and the need to cut down on core franchises.\n\n\u201cElsewhere within sportswear, New Balance and Skechers are also expected to gain share, bolstered by their versatility, alongside their high-profile athlete and brand partnerships,\u201d Ljubojevic said.\n\nSkechers has been on a tear recently, expanding into categories including soccer cleats and basketball shoes, alongside a robust brand ambassador strategy. Among others, Skechers has signed Harry Kane, Julius Randle, Terance Mann, OG Anunoby, Bernhard Langer and Kiki Iriafen. The retailer also recently signed a deal to sell itself to 3G Capital for $9.4 billion.\n\nAlthough Shein will gain share again this year, that growth is slowing now \u201cdue to its established presence,\u201d GlobalData said. Low prices and quick action on trends are helping the brand outshine others in apparel, though, including H&M and Zara.",

In Q2 those operations grew as fast or faster than its online and physical stores and together netted more revenue. The company\u2019s stalwart cloud business also continues to be yet another boon to its e-commerce.\n\nOnline plus brick-and-mortar net sales topped $67 billion, while advertising plus subscription fees plus seller services, where growth was mostly higher, topped $68 billion. Sales at the AWS unit rose 17.5% year over year to nearly $31 billion.\n\n\u201cThe solid growth and profitability of AWS and advertising should continue to outperform and support Retail,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group analysts led by Joseph Feldman said in a note on the company\u2019s Q2 report.\n\nThis is a unique situation in retail, though Amazon is encountering many of the same challenges. Currently that includes uncertainty around tariffs.\n\n\u201cThere continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cMuch of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we can share is what we've seen thus far, which is that through the first half of the year, we haven't yet seen diminishing demand nor prices meaningfully appreciating,\u201d he also said.\n\nOne aspect of the Trump administration\u2019s trade policy \u2014 the end of the de minimis loophole on goods from China and elsewhere \u2014 could turn around the lackluster performance from Amazon Haul, the company\u2019s answer to ultra-cheap sites like Shein and Temu. Or at least mute the competition for a while.\n\n\u201cAmazon remains the main winner from the ongoing disruption to this part of the market,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. \u201cAdmittedly, this disruption will not last forever as both Shein and Temu will reformulate their approach \u2013 but a big part of their advantage has been lost for good, and that works in Amazon\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s push into rural areas will also soon pay off, according to Saunders. In June, Amazon announced plans to bring same- and next-day delivery to more than 4,000 small towns and rural communities by the end of the year, saying earlier in the year that it would invest more than $4 billion by 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe gains in any one area might be modest but given the sheer number of rural areas across America and the relative lack of retail competition within them, the gains for Amazon are significant,\u201d Saunders said.",

Related operations demonstrated stronger growth, with advertising up 23% to $15.7 billion and subscription services up 12% to $12.2 billion.

The company is also investing in expanding its delivery network into rural areas across America.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Online store net sales: $61.5 billion, up 11% year over year.\n*   Advertising revenue: up 23% to $15.7 billion.\n*   AWS sales: rose 17.5% year over year to nearly $31 billion.\n*   Adjacent businesses (advertising, subscription fees, seller services) collectively topped $68 billion.\n*   Investment in rural delivery network: more than $4 billion by 2026.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Amazon:** E-commerce giant reporting Q2 financial results and strategic focus shifts.\n*   **Andy Jassy:** Amazon CEO who provided commentary on Q2 performance, brand additions, and tariffs.\n*   **Telsey Advisory Group:** Research firm whose analysts commented on AWS and advertising supporting retail.\n*   **Joseph Feldman:** Analyst with Telsey Advisory Group who led comments on Amazon's Q2 report.\n*   **GlobalData:** Research firm whose Managing Director commented on Amazon's market advantages.\n*   **Neil Saunders:** GlobalData Managing Director who discussed Amazon's gains from trade policy changes.\n*   **Shein/Temu:** Ultra-cheap sites whose competitive advantage against Amazon Haul is diminished.\n*   **Nike:** Brand whose products are making a \"much requested return\" to Amazon's assortment.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Expansion of same- and next-day delivery to over 4,000 rural communities by year-end.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nAmazon's adjacent businesses are now primary growth engines supporting retail.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIt\u2019s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we\u2019re still thinking about.\n\nFrom Petco\u2019s 60th anniversary to the future of Outdoor Voices, here\u2019s our closeout for the week.\n\nWhat you may have missed\n\nJ. McLaughlin names CEO\n\nApparel brand J. McLaughlin this week named Greg Unis chief executive officer. Unis had been serving as interim CEO since March.\n\n\u201cGreg\u2019s passion for design and brand-building make him the right leader for this pivotal moment,\u201d Kevin McLaughlin, co-founder of J. McLaughlin, said in a statement. \u201cHe understands what makes J. McLaughlin special and brings a fresh perspective to help us further engage with our customers and stay true to our roots.\u201d\n\nPrior to J. McLaughlin, Unis served as president of Victoria\u2019s Secret and Pink. He has also held senior executive roles at Coach, Brooks Brothers and Gap Inc.\n\nStaples expands partnership with Verizon\n\nStaples and Verizon have expanded their partnership, bringing the phone and internet carrier\u2019s kiosks to 35 Staples stores.\n\nThe initiative marks the start of a broader effort to bring \u201cmore wireless and tech services to Staples customers this year,\u201d the companies said in their announcement Thursday.\n\n\u201cAt Staples, we\u2019re focused on bringing in the right partners to deliver even more value to our customers and this collaboration with Verizon does exactly that,\u201d Marshall Warkentin, president of Staples U.S. Retail, said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re making essential wireless services more accessible for small businesses and everyday shoppers in the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nThe stores will open on a rolling basis through mid-August, with additional locations opening later in the year.\n\nTillys names a new CEO\n\nYouth apparel company Tillys announced that, effective Aug. 18, Nate Smith will step into the role of president, chief executive officer and director. Current CEO Hezy Shaked will transition to the executive chairman role also on that date, per a company press release.\n\nSmith joins the company from Marolina Outdoor, where he served as CEO. He also has leadership experience at Boardriders, Oakley and Patagonia, among other companies.\n\n\u201cTillys has had a strong track record of success over its 43-year history, and I am excited to work with Hezy, the Board and the team to revitalize and build upon that history,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nRetail therapy\n\nIHOP enters the Dubai chocolate ring\n\nPistachio shortage? If that\u2019s the case, IHOP hasn\u2019t gotten the memo. The famous breakfast foods chain is debuting two limited-edition Dubai chocolate-flavored pancake stacks on Monday in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin.\n\nThe first 25 guests will get the luxe Dubai chocolate pancake stack for free, featuring Madagascar vanilla whipped cream, a whole Dubai chocolate bar, edible 24K gold flakes and gold glitter. After that, guests can purchase a scaled-down version for $13, per a Wednesday press release.\n\nNo, you wear it on your head\n\nIn Prada\u2019s latest attempt to offer products to people who have more money than common sense, the fashion house is offering a cat basket and passing it off as a hat. The Straw Visor Cap currently sells on Saks Fifth Avenue for $2,800.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t vibing with the lampshade-on-your-head look, definitely pick up the company\u2019s holey Leather Visor for a lot less ($1,790) or a more traditional cotton baseball cap for $895.\n\nIs it a lampshade? Is it a hat? Can it be both? Retrieved from Saks Fifth Avenue on July 30, 2025\n\nWhat we\u2019re still thinking about\n\n12.6%\n\nThat\u2019s how much Purple's second quarter net revenue declined year over year.\n\nThe mattress company attributed the drop to \u201cdelays in the timing of Rejuvenate 2.0 shipments, lapping reductions in wholesale door count from 2024, and softness in ecommerce.\u201d Still, executives sounded upbeat on the full year, reiterating guidance and saying on an earnings call Tuesday that the brand expects its showrooms to become profitable in 2025.\n\n60\n\nThat\u2019s how old Petco is this year. The retailer, a brick-and-mortar stalwart, started off as a veterinary supply mail-order business. Acquiring two pet-supply rivals in 1988 tripled its store footprint, and its expansion continued well into the 21st century. More recently, the chain has struggled, though, and it\u2019s now pursuing a turnaround under new leadership.\n\nFor its anniversary this month, Petco is hosting tastings, promotions and adoption events, including a birthday party Aug. 16 at stores nationwide. From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time, pets and their families get various treats, with gift bags going to the first 60 customers. The festivities culminate on Aug. 26, National Dog Day, with special deals and an Instagram giveaway for a chance to win a Petco shopping spree.\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nThe return of Outdoor Voices\n\nAfter an abrupt closure of its store footprint last year and a sale to Consortium Brand Partners, Outdoor Voices is back with new product and its old founder. Ty Haney has rejoined the brand as founder, owner and partner, and led the nine-month-long design process of the brand\u2019s new collection, launching next week.\n\nThe move has already sparked plenty of discourse about what Outdoor Voices will accomplish this time around, with fans peppering the brand\u2019s Instagram with comments about which products to bring back and general excitement for the reveal. Many also praised the return of Haney herself, who left the brand in 2020 under tumultuous circumstances.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all exercise dress bliss. The brand\u2019s posts have also become home to customers airing grievances about certain style changes in the new collection \u2014 including a sweater with a sparkly \u201cDoing Things\u201d bedazzled on the front \u2014 as well as complaints about limited sizing and months-old order mishaps.\n\nWith Haney back at the helm and the deeper resources of a parent company, can Outdoor Voices regain its spot in activewear shoppers\u2019 closets?",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Retail Sector Shifts: New Leadership, Key Partnerships, and Brand Resurgence\n\n**Key details:**\nApparel brand J. McLaughlin named Greg Unis chief executive officer, following his interim tenure since March. Staples expanded its partnership with Verizon, integrating phone and internet carrier kiosks into 35 stores. Tillys appointed Nate Smith as its new president, CEO, and director, with current CEO Hezy Shaked transitioning to executive chairman on August 18. Purple's second quarter net revenue declined 12.6% year over year, attributed to shipment delays, wholesale reductions, and e-commerce softness. Outdoor Voices is returning with a new collection, with founder Ty Haney rejoining as owner and partner.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese leadership appointments at J. McLaughlin and Tillys aim to bring fresh perspectives and revitalization to their respective brands. Staples' partnership with Verizon could enhance its value proposition by expanding tech services for customers. Purple's 12.6% revenue decline in Q2, despite reaffirmed full-year guidance and a 2025 profitability outlook for showrooms, presents a mixed picture that could challenge a bearish consensus. The return of Outdoor Voices with its founder and new resources challenges the prior view established by its abrupt store closures, suggesting a potential resurgence. Petco's 60th anniversary highlights its long history, but recent struggles and a current turnaround effort indicate challenges to its prior stability.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe retail sector continues to see significant activity, including executive appointments and strategic partnerships. Apparel brands J. McLaughlin and Tillys are undergoing leadership transitions, bringing in seasoned executives from other major companies. Retailers like Staples are actively seeking collaborations to expand their service offerings and attract more customers. Long-standing companies such as Petco are navigating turnarounds under new leadership. The article also tracks the resurgence of brands like Outdoor Voices, which are re-entering the market with new backing after previous closures.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   12.6%: Purple's second quarter net revenue decline year over year.\n*   35: Number of Staples stores receiving Verizon kiosks initially.\n*   60: Petco's age in years this year.\n*   Aug. 18: Effective date for Nate Smith's CEO role at Tillys and Hezy Shaked's transition.\n*   2025: Year Purple expects its showrooms to become profitable.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **J. McLaughlin:** Apparel brand that named Greg Unis as its new chief executive officer.\n*   **Greg Unis:** Appointed CEO of J. McLaughlin, bringing prior executive roles at Victoria's Secret.\n*   **Staples:** Retailer expanding its partnership with Verizon to offer wireless and tech services.\n*   **Verizon:** Phone and internet carrier expanding its partnership, bringing kiosks to Staples stores.\n*   **Tillys:** Youth apparel company appointing Nate Smith as its new President and CEO.\n*   **Nate Smith:** Named CEO of Tillys, joining from Marolina Outdoor with past leadership experience.\n*   **Purple:** Mattress company reporting a 12.6% decline in second-quarter net revenue.\n*   **Petco:** Retailer celebrating its 60th anniversary while pursuing a turnaround under new leadership.\n*   **Outdoor Voices:** Brand returning with new products after a sale, rejoined by its founder.\n*   **Ty Haney:** Founder of Outdoor Voices, rejoining the brand as owner and partner post-sale.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Staples-Verizon kiosks will open on a rolling basis through mid-August, with additional locations later.\n*   Tillys' new CEO, Nate Smith, will step into his role effective August 18.\n*   Outdoor Voices' new collection is set to launch next week.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew leadership and strategic partnerships are shaping the evolving retail landscape.",

Two pilot locations will also offer free pickup for most Ikea orders. This marks the first time Ikea products and services are available at another U.S. retailer.\n\n**Why it matters:** This partnership represents a new strategy for Ikea, making its services and products available outside its traditional stores for the first time in the U.S. For Best Buy, this initiative follows a recent revenue decline and lowered full-year guidance, indicating a move to diversify offerings and attract new customer segments. The collaboration aims to create a \"one-stop destination\" for home design, potentially challenging the consensus that Best Buy is solely an electronics retailer and Ikea relies only on its large, individual stores. It suggests a strategic response to current market conditions for both companies.\n\n**The big picture:** This new partnership aligns with Ikea's broader U.S. expansion, including plans to open eight new planning and pickup format stores this year across several states.

It shrewdly anticipated a market shift towards lower-cost options. Its distinctive \"cheap chic\" merchandising, even dubbed \"Tarzhay\" by executives, previously bolstered its fortunes. However, the retailer may now be at a crossroads, exhibiting weaknesses where its strengths once lay.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article suggests that Target's long-standing \"cheap chic\" merchandising, once a driver of its success, is now perceived as a weakness. This directly challenges the consensus view that this unique brand positioning is an unyielding competitive advantage for the company. For investors, this implies that Target's historical differentiation may no longer be a reliable source of strength. It highlights a critical inflection point where past success factors are potentially contributing to current challenges.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMinneapolis-based department store conglomerate Dayton-Hudson launched Target in 1962, anticipating a consumer shift to off-price and lower-cost retail options. This origin contrasts Target with other mass merchants that primarily focus on a value pitch.

The two have also tapped \u201cGen Z favorites\u201d including Coco Samone and Shannon Zhao, among others, to star in a promotional campaign sporting styles from the collection.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPink\u2019s limited-edition collection with LoveShackFancy is another bid for Gen Z, a priority of parent company Victoria\u2019s Secret & Co.\n\nIn a Q3 earnings call late last year, CEO Hillary Super noted the company was focused on attracting Gen Z customers and had reshaped its stores to highlight the Pink brand, taking steps such as giving Pink more in-store space, displaying the brand more prominently and adding more apparel to its product assortment.\n\nTo that end, the LoveShackFancy collection offers \u201ca fresh take on feminine fashion with a Gen Z twist,\u201d per a company press release.\n\n\u201cThe Pink x LoveShackFancy collection brings together the best of both brands \u2014 celebrating confidence-boosting style, friendship, fun, and of course, our shared love of pink,\u201d Ali Dillon, president at Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to offer fan-favorite styles with LoveShackFancy\u2019s signature romantic twist and bring back nostalgic pieces from our archives.\u201d\n\nFinancially, the collection comes amid a turnaround at Pink\u2019s parent company. In a Q1 earnings report, Victoria\u2019s Secret & Co. said net sales were flat compared to the year prior, and its comps dipped 1% year over year. However, the company\u2019s net income rose to $2.8 million, up from its $2.5 million net loss last year.\n\n\u201cI continue to be really bullish on Pink,\u201d Super said during the first-quarter earnings call with analysts, noting that the brand has \u201can incredible amount of runway.\u201d\n\nAs the company courts Gen Z shoppers, the intimates retailer is also fending off investors seeking to take control of the brand. In May, the company implemented a limited-duration shareholder rights plan, otherwise known as a poison pill. It made the move after investment firm BBRC International purchased a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of Victoria\u2019s Secret stock.",

Gross merchandise sales fell 5.4% year over year to $2.4 billion, and its number of active buyers fell 4.6% to 87.3 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s smaller U.K.-based Depop marketplace fared better, with GMS up 35.3% to $249.6 million; U.S. GMS grew 54%.\n\nOverall at the company GMS fell 4.8% to $2.8 billion, while revenue rose 3.8% to $672.7 million. Net income reached $28.8 million, down by $24.2 million compared to last year. The number of active buyers dropped by 3.4% to 93.3 million.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEtsy Inc. is working to inject strength into its flagship marketplace as declines in various metrics continued in Q2, and the company is betting that mobile will provide a much-needed boost.\n\n\u201cThe app is key to our flywheel,\u201d CEO Joshua Silverman told analysts Wednesday. \u201cToday, it's not just different than a year ago. It's markedly better, more intuitive, more inspiring and a lot more browseable, with the introduction of multiple new features you can see by simply opening the app homepage.\u201d\n\nIn Q2, GMS on the marketplace\u2019s app outpaced non-app GMS and reached nearly 45% of total GMS, he said.\n\nThe company aims to dial down its marketing via linear cable television to about a low single-digit percentage of its U.S. brand media spend and \u201cdramatically\u201d shift to more marketing via streaming platforms, Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal said. The company is also turning more to \u201cpartnerships and influencers to build awareness and credibility,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese efforts go hand-in-hand with our work to build a better app experience,\u201d Goyal said. \u201cSo that when we reach buyers, they land on an engaging intuitive shopping experience that both inspires and enables them to browse and explore.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s once-trailblazing search ranking models are \u201cnot the right fit for where the future of personalized shopping experiences are headed,\u201d she also said, citing conversations with newly returned Chief Technology Officer Rafe Colburn.\n\n\u201cSo we're retooling our ranking platform to more effectively leverage capabilities of LLMs in generative AI, allowing us to understand our listings, users and their activity much more deeply as we work to deliver better search results,\u201d Goyal said. \u201cAnd we're creating more diverse and engaging recommendations by scoring items across a very broad range of interests and clustering them to capture nonobvious connections to encourage discovery.\u201d\n\nThe approach will improve Etsy\u2019s ability to predict and match buyer interest over time, as it has already at Depop, she said.\n\nGoyal underscored the role of sellers as well. Marketplaces from Poshmark to Amazon have adjusted various seller policies in the past several months; in April Etsy added tools for sellers. The site\u2019s fees and other policies have upset sellers in the past, but Goyal told analysts that work to enable sellers is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWhile most marketplaces push sellers into the background, we have the opportunity to bring sellers to the forefront,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're finding ways to better highlight the sellers behind the items and create more seamless connections between them and buyers throughout the shopping journey, from the listing page to the custom order process and direct conversations.\u201d\n\nEtsy completed the sale of Reverb on June 2; the company acquired the secondhand musical instrument site six years ago.",

Overall company GMS declined 4.8% to $2.8 billion, yet revenue increased 3.8% to $672.7 million. Depop, however, experienced 35.3% GMS growth to $249.6 million, with U.S. GMS up 54%. The company reported net income of $28.8 million, down $24.2 million year-over-year. Mobile app GMS reached nearly 45% of total GMS, outpacing non-app GMS.\n\n**Why it matters:** Etsy's ongoing declines in key metrics for its flagship marketplace suggest current strategies may not be effective. The company is retooling its search ranking models, moving away from \"once-trailblazing\" methods to leverage generative AI. This shift, along with a dramatic change in marketing from linear cable television to streaming and influencers, challenges the view that Etsy's established approach is sustainable. It indicates a need for significant operational adjustments to reverse the current trajectory of its main business.\n\n**The big picture:** Etsy Inc. is working to strengthen its flagship marketplace as key metric declines persisted in Q2. The company aims to boost growth through its mobile app, which leadership states is \"markedly better\" and \"key to our flywheel.\" Etsy is also dramatically shifting its U.S. brand media spend from linear cable television to streaming platforms and influencers. Furthermore, the company is retooling its search ranking platform to incorporate generative AI and LLMs for improved results and recommendations. These efforts, alongside enhancing seller support, represent a strategic pivot.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Flagship marketplace GMS: fell 5.4% year over year to $2.4 billion.\n*   Overall company GMS: fell 4.8% to $2.8 billion.\n*   Revenue: rose 3.8% to $672.7 million.\n*   Net income: $28.8 million, down $24.2 million compared to last year.\n*   Depop marketplace GMS: grew 35.3% to $249.6 million.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Etsy Inc.:** The e-commerce company whose flagship marketplace struggled with declining metrics in Q2.\n*   **Joshua Silverman:** CEO, who emphasized the mobile app as \"key to our flywheel\" for future growth.\n*   **Kruti Patel Goyal:** Chief Growth Officer, who detailed shifts in marketing spend and AI integration for search.\n*   **Rafe Colburn:** Newly returned Chief Technology Officer, consulted on retooling search ranking models.\n*   **Depop:** Etsy's smaller U.K.-based marketplace that significantly increased gross merchandise sales.\n*   **Poshmark:** Another marketplace mentioned for recently adjusting various seller policies.\n*   **Amazon:** Another marketplace noted for recently adjusting various seller policies.\n*   **Reverb:** Secondhand musical instrument site, whose sale by Etsy was completed on June 2.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Etsy pivots strategy to mobile, AI, and marketing as flagship struggles persist.",

The agency said it needs to begin planning for a 40% cut in service for the Chicago Transit Authority and Metra commuter railroad, with the loss of nearly 3,000 transit jobs.\n\nThe House and Senate bills would reorganize the transit system under a regional entity called the Northern Illinois Transit Authority. It would shift certain responsibilities from three individual agencies to the regional authority and add more than $1 billion in estimated new operating revenue. The legislation would also create a statewide $1.50 package-delivery fee and a fee on businesses engaging in electric vehicle charging to help fund the transit system.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes a mandate to buy only zero-emission buses. However, these come at a higher price than traditional transit buses and have large production backlogs. Battery-electric buses can cost over $1 million, about twice the price of a traditional diesel-powered transit bus. Nash said this \u201ccould lead to fewer buses available for service over the next decade.\u201d\n\nWhile the proposed House and Senate bills were similar, they differed in ways that required resolution. The last reading of the bills in the two chambers went along party lines, with the House voting 68 to 39 and the Senate voting 32 to 22, with three Democrats voting nay, short of the three-fifths needed for passage.\n\nThe Illinois General Assembly ended its spring legislative session May 31 and would have to come back in special session or its annual veto session in the fall to take up the bills again this year.\n\nNash said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and the legislators \u201cintend to continue to work on transit funding and reform through the summer into the fall, but a firm timeline has not been set for any future legislative action.\u201d",

In Chicago, they\u2019re down 38% since 2020. Newark has seen a more than 60% reduction in violent crime and homicides over the past decade.\n\nThese statistics are not a result of zero-tolerance, tough-on-crime policies, the mayors of these cities said during a media briefing held Thursday by the Democratic Mayors Association and the justice advocacy group Vera Action. Rather, they attributed the reduction in violent crime to investments in community-focused solutions such as targeted policing, violence intervention, mental health services and youth employment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a remarkable moment here, halfway through 2025,\u201d said Insha Rahman, Vera Institute of Justice vice president of advocacy and partnerships. Nationwide, homicides are down 22.6%, overall violent crime is down 6.4% and property crime has dropped by 8.8% since 2020, she said.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s really important to note is that there were huge amounts of federal and local dollars \u2014 millions, maybe even billions \u2014 put into community-based solutions for safety,\u201d Rahman said. At the same time, she noted, \u201coverall, the number of police was down between 5% to 10%, so that wasn't actually the driver of these remarkable gains in community safety.\u201d\n\nChicago has reduced crime by strategically deploying officers, partnering with community violence intervention groups and investing in mental health clinics and youth employment programs in the city\u2019s 35 most violent police beats, said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. The city has also worked to repair \u201chistoric distrust\u201d between the residents and police officers based on what he called \u201cdecades of bad policing\u201d targeting the Black community.\n\nToday, Johnson said, constitutional policing plays a role in crime reduction, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the only body of government or entity of government that should be responsible for the challenges that we are experiencing.\u201d\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said his city has \u201cthe lowest amount of violent crime and homicides that we\u2019ve seen [to date this year] in the history of this city.\u201d He attributed this to a focus on deterrence and investments in community violence intervention and hospital-based response programs, as well as in recreation and parks in historically overlooked neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe all know that zero-tolerance and lock-up-everyone-Black and lock-up-everyone-poor policing didn't work,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt's never been about how many arrests a police department is making. It's about who and for what and the certainty of accountability for everyone.\u201d\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka attributed his city\u2019s over 60% reduction in violent crime and homicides to a decade-long coordinated intervention strategy involving hospitals, community organizations, public safety roundtables designed to build trust between police and community members, and intelligence-based policing that targets the most violent individuals and neighborhoods.\n\nHe and Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, president of the Democratic Mayors Association, decried the Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of hundreds of public safety grants in April, saying it will affect many of these programs.",

Over the past month, the U.S. has experienced dangerous and deadly flash flooding and extreme heat. Projections for the 2025 wildfire season in the Western U.S. indicate significantly increased fire potential driven by drought expansion and above-average temperatures. Meanwhile, the 2025 U.S. tornado season is on track to be above the 30-year historical average, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season.\n\nBesides the devastating loss of life and the damage inflicted by these types of events, they have something else in common: they often leave communities without power to meet critical needs. Despite the inevitable occurrence of these events, there is good news for people in the paths of these natural disasters.\n\nThe power sector is not waiting around to reactively address damage from the next severe weather event. Hurricanes or extreme heat may be seasonal, but preparation is not.\n\nA coalition of more than 40 energy providers and system operators \u2014 along with 100 academics, policymakers, non-profits, government agencies and others \u2014 have worked together to develop a data-driven, science-based framework to improve the resilience and reliability of the power system.\n\nThe public Climate READi framework, issued and developed by independent, non-profit energy R&D institute EPRI, guides energy companies in assessing risk and vulnerability in the energy system across a wide variety of weather and climate conditions. In addition, utilities, regulators and other stakeholders can use this set of guidance, references and tools to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments and adapt the evolving electric system to the climate of the future.\n\nThe framework, developed over the past three years, highlights how factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience to climate hazards. Knowing the exposure of assets and systems to current and future climate hazards and pinpointing system vulnerabilities at the asset and company level is key for determining which adaptation strategies to consider for any region. It\u2019s important to note there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer, as a West Coast utility may need to prepare against wildfires versus an East Coast utility, which may more frequently deal with ice storms. Having different options for what best suits individual utilities will be key to proactive planning for these events.\n\nSo how do companies conduct climate-informed planning and analysis?\n\nFirst, the framework recommends having a dedicated team with clear ownership and responsibility. Once in place, the framework recommends the team begin with in-depth and iterative scoping, setting expectations among internal and external stakeholders to define the bounds and objectives of the assessment, while also integrating information from previous impacts of weather and climate events on asset or system performance. This involves the selection of climate data and vulnerability information that characterizes baseline conditions and captures the range of expected future conditions.\n\nSecond, the framework recommends conducting model-based evaluations across an integrated modeling platform, where data and assumptions are used consistently throughout. The company may also want to review its existing integrated resource plans, regulatory filings, or other planning documents to identify plausible future configurations of its portfolio.\n\nThird, it is important to ensure the load data used for planning and evaluation reflects the weather dependency for the selected conditions and technologies being evaluated.\n\nLastly, the framework recommends comparing baseline model results to results with the various adaptations in place to determine the anticipated benefits and cost effectiveness of options under consideration. This comparison can be used to justify and prioritize adaptation investments.\n\nWork has and will continue to be underway to proactively plan for the weather of the future. For example, last year, researchers from EPRI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory mapped how future hurricanes could affect power outage risk. Working with PNNL, we combined synthetic hurricane tracks in a future climate with a predictive power outage model, developed using power outage data from 23 historical hurricanes that affected the continental United States and Puerto Rico between 2016 and 2023. This allowed us to assess changes in outage risk in the 2066-2100 timeframe compared to today\u2019s climate. According to the models, the average person in the metropolitan areas of Houston, New Orleans and Boston could see expected outage events increase by more than 70% per decade, while Miami residents may see a 119% increase.\n\nAs this analysis shows, there isn\u2019t one clear answer, since different locations have different needs and weather conditions. Regardless of where you live, it\u2019s clear that a common, consistent and collaborative framework for physical climate risk \u2014 and available to all parties \u2014 is needed to ensure the reliable, resilient and affordable power system of the future for all of us.",

        "summary": "**Power Sector Unites to Enhance Grid Resilience Against Climate Hazards**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has issued the public Climate READi framework, a data-driven, science-based guide to improve power system resilience and reliability. This framework helps energy companies assess risk and vulnerability across various weather and climate conditions. Utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders can use it to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments, and adapt the electric system. The framework highlights factoring climate risk into investment decisions as a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience. It recommends dedicated teams, iterative scoping, model-based evaluations, and comparing baseline results to determine adaptation benefits.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nExtreme weather events increasingly leave communities without power, indicating a significant vulnerability in the current system. The power sector is shifting from reactively addressing damage to proactive preparation, signaling a change in industry approach. The new framework aims to improve grid resilience and reliability, which is crucial for consistent service. By identifying climate risk as a cost-effective investment, it challenges any view that such adaptations are merely unrecoverable costs, suggesting they are economically beneficial. This collaborative effort indicates a move towards a common, consistent approach for a more reliable, resilient, and affordable power system.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe U.S. is experiencing dangerous and deadly extreme weather events, including flash flooding, heat, and projections for significantly increased wildfire and tornado potential. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season. These events lead to loss of life, damage, and widespread power outages.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nArtificial intelligence is changing the face of waste education. City staff and facility operators are looking beyond paper mailers and public service announcements to cameras, screens and text prompts. The technology is designed to meet users at the bins and help them navigate the complexities of local recycling rules.\n\nAI has been used to identify items and trigger physical separation within materials recovery facilities for years, and more recently it\u2019s even been implemented to track contamination levels at the point of collection when haulers integrate camera systems into their trucks. But neither of these use cases go as far upstream as trying to help consumers make the right decision about where to put their refuse, recyclables or organics.\n\n\u201cThis was really an effort to help people better understand small nuances, and it also gave us new insights about common questions and gaps in knowledge,\u201d said Pamela Perez, marketing manager for LA Sanitation & Environment, which recently introduced Professor Green, an AI tool for organics recycling education.\n\nProponents of these AI feedback systems hope they can cut down on contamination and increase capture rates, but the technology is still evolving.\n\nWhether the tools are chatbots or item-identifying cameras, operators have to tinker with the software over time and hone its ability to offer users the right responses. Experts say accurate item identification \u2014 particularly at the curb, where trash and recycling come in an almost infinite number of forms \u2014 could be a challenge for some iterations of this consumer-facing AI. Another hurdle will be convincing consumers to use it.\n\nSend a text or take a photo\n\nContamination rates remain stubbornly high, as recycling rates are also stagnant in many parts of the U.S.\n\nIn New York City, for example, non-recyclable contaminants in the metal, plastic and glass waste stream have increased from nearly 34 pounds to almost 49 pounds per household between 2017 and 2023. The Recycling Partnership estimated in 2020 that the inbound material contamination rate was 17%.\n\nWaste and recycling professionals hoping to improve these statistics are looking to AI as enabling coaching for residents and visitors on the spot.\n\nA rendering of Oscar Sort\u2019s AI-enable sorting technology, which uses cameras to help people decide where to place their items at airports, universities and other public areas. Permission granted by Intuitive AI\n\nSome public-facing AI sorting systems identify items the same way MRF technologies do. Oscar Sort, a platform offered by Intuitive AI, uses a camera to see what a user is holding. A follow-up message on a mounted screen shows which bin to drop it in \u2014 trash, recycling, compost, or even (as one client requested) a chopstick-only receptacle for a recycling service that turns them into wooden furniture. The software can also offer multi-part instructions, like directing a coffee cup to the trash bin and a cardboard sleeve to the recycling bin.\n\nIn the U.S., facilities such as the San Francisco Ferry Building and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport are in the early stages of using Oscar on site. The company says over 25 airports and 50 universities asked to become customers in the last year.\n\nEach Oscar installation costs $10,000 to $15,000, after which yearly services and data fees cost $5,500 to $6,500, said Brian Sano, head of strategy at Intuitive AI. In 2024, the company launched an ad-based offering \u2014 brands can pay to advertise on the embedded screens, generating potentially enough revenue for the facility to cover annual maintenance costs and then some.\n\nConsumer-facing sorting AI can also take in what the public offers via text, which is how the city of Los Angeles opted for its technology to operate.\n\nProfessor Green, the AI educator built for the city by software company Hello Lamp Post, works like a chatbot. Users in one of four pilot neighborhoods \u2014 Porter Ranch, Northridge, South LA and Watts \u2014 scan a QR code or go to the city website to text Professor Green. The system replies to tell users if their item can go in a city-provided green bin or their trash or recycling bins. The chatbot understands and replies to English, Spanish, Korean, Tagalog, Ethiopian and Armenian \u2014 languages selected to best serve populations in the pilot area.\n\nIdeally, Professor Green clears up local confusion about composting rules. The City of Los Angeles has a lot of residents who move in to the municipality and might not be familiar with local guidelines, Perez said, or need help parsing the rules from those of nearby areas. For example, some of the other municipalities in Los Angeles County ask that residents line their bins with compostable bags, but the city of Los Angeles only accepts paper-product liners.\n\nToo few trash photos\n\nBoth Intuitive AI and LA Sanitation staff dip into the data to make sure their programs are identifying items correctly.\n\nIntuitive AI does this for Oscar customers by comparing the instructions Oscar offers to recordings of what the user was holding, every day, along with four waste audits a year for most customers.\n\nLA Sanitation staff also comb through Professor Green requests every day. They spend at most an hour on the inquiries, which is often more than enough time to spot any issues. For example, staff taught the AI to respond to questions about tamale waste but soon realized it didn\u2019t know corn husks were part of the food. Perez said the team has since instructed Professor Green to associate the two.\n\nText-based sorting inquiries will likely give users more accurate instructions than camera-based technology, said Sharon Hsiao, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University.\n\nThat\u2019s because having people tell the AI what they\u2019re trying to dispose of gets around the issue of having to train the software to recognize what trash looks like. Written prompts can still run a wide range. As Perez pointed out, her office had a long list of terms for \u201cpet waste\u201d that Professor Green needed to recognize. But visual identification has even more variability.\n\n\u201cCigarette butts or COVID masks \u2014 those are very distinct,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cBut if you crumple up paper, it won\u2019t always be the same shape.\u201d\n\nThere are also few photos of trash that are freely available for AI models to learn from.\n\nHsiao and her colleagues tried to compile a database of these publicly accessible training images when building an AI waste sorter that relies on a smartphone camera. Not only were there too few images to train the software, but the computational power that would be needed for the AI to recognize any possible item goes beyond anything a smart phone can handle, Hsiao said.\n\nAn AI system focused on waste requires a small computer and is more likely to be accurate if developers can train the software to recognize a limited array of items, Hsiao said. Places that restrict the kinds of materials allowed inside, like entertainment venues or airports, could be a natural fit.\n\nLower barriers are better\n\nExperts expect technology to play an increasing role as local governments and facility operators look for ways to evolve their recycling education. But figuring out what will resonate with the public is an ongoing process.\n\nAI-enabled camera systems might be easier for users, despite being harder to teach. In surveys, Hsiao and her team found that people are likely to think of texting or responding to voice prompts as more work than waiting for a camera to register what it\u2019s seeing. And all of these options were considered significantly more time-consuming than the status quo \u2014the split-second decision of throwing items into whichever bin it seems to belong.\n\n\u201cAll the people that we surveyed wanted to be able to use their phone to scan items to tell them which bin it's supposed to be in,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cIn reality, they actually don't do it.\u201d\n\nTo convince people to take the time and use the AI identification they claim to want, Hsiao and her colleagues are working on a sorting system that also tells users about the benefits of their actions. Her team is experimenting with feedback about money or greenhouse gas emissions saved via correct sorting.\n\nFor now, the simpler text-based Professor Green option appears to be resonating. Los Angelenos have had over 4,000 conversations with the AI since its debut in March. Use has been particularly high in South LA, a low-income neighborhood where the majority of households speak Spanish at home.\n\nLA Sanitation is now looking at expanding Professor Green to other neighborhoods in the future. But to know for certain whether the AI system is meaningfully changing contamination rates or diverting more material from landfills, Perez and her team would have to see the results of a more old-fashioned tool: a waste audit.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Waste Dive: Recycling newsletter.

Minneapolis; Gainesville, Florida; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, have all eliminated single family zoning, allowing multifamily housing citywide.\n\nHome to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville attracts a large number of students and professionals, Pinkston said. But until 2024, the city had \u201cvery restrictive zoning in terms of what could be built,\u201d he said.\n\nCharlottesville\u2019s ordinance updated the city\u2019s zoning map, rolled back regulations requiring a certain number of parking spaces in housing developments and allowed duplexes to be built throughout the city \u2014 effectively eliminating single-family zoning. The changes made it easier to build housing and add housing density throughout the city, Pinkston said.\n\n\u201cWe see it as a tool in addressing the housing affordability crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some states and cities, those reforms have received pushback, including lawsuits. Six Colorado cities sued the state over a pair of laws that required communities to ease their local land-use regulations to allow for more housing construction, for example.\n\nA group of residents sued Charlottesville shortly after it passed its ordinance, arguing that the city did not follow the proper process before adopting it, the city stated on its website.\n\nA Charlottesville Circuit Court judge granted a default judgement in the case on June 30 after the city\u2019s outside counsel failed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint by a required deadline. That voided the 2024 zoning ordinance, which had replaced the old one, leaving the city without a zoning code in place, the city stated.\n\nAs a result, the city placed all zoning-related applications on hold, affecting new construction, additions, site modifications and changes in land use, the city stated on July 11. It continued processing building permit applications such as trade and fire permits.\n\nThe city is in talks with the residents and their counsel to settle the case. If needed, it will ask the court to reconsider or will file an appeal, the city stated.\n\nWhile the city\u2019s legal counsel attempts to resolve the issue, the City Council is also working to re-adopt the 2024 zoning code. Last week, it passed a resolution to refer the amended code to the city\u2019s Planning Commission for review and recommendations. According to the resolution, the commission is required to hold a public hearing and report its findings and recommendations to the City Council within 100 days after its next meeting.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Charlottesville halts development after key housing density ordinance voided.\n\n**Key details:**\nCharlottesville, Virginia, paused all zoning application approvals last month. This action followed a state judge voiding the city's 2024 zoning ordinance, which had been unanimously adopted in December 2023. The ordinance was voided via a default judgment because the city's outside counsel failed to respond to an amended complaint in a lawsuit. Residents had sued the city, alleging that proper process was not followed during the ordinance's adoption. This legal outcome left Charlottesville without a zoning code in place as of July 11.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe voiding of the 2024 zoning ordinance directly impacts development, halting new construction, additions, and changes in land use in Charlottesville. This creates immediate uncertainty for investors and developers planning projects that relied on the new, more lenient zoning rules. The ordinance was intended to increase housing density and address affordability, a policy direction observed in many U.S. cities. This unexpected legal reversal challenges the previous consensus that Charlottesville was moving towards an easier, more permissive housing development environment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCharlottesville joined a growing trend among U.S. cities and states in 2023 by reforming its zoning code to allow greater housing density. The now-voided 2024 ordinance eliminated single-family zoning, rolled back parking space requirements, and permitted duplexes citywide. These changes were explicitly designed to create more housing density and help address Charlottesville\u2019s housing affordability crisis. However, such density-increasing reforms have received pushback and lawsuits in other jurisdictions. Historically, Charlottesville, home to the University of Virginia, had \"very restrictive zoning.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2024:** Year the voided zoning ordinance took effect.\n*   **December 2023:** Month the City Council unanimously adopted the ordinance.\n*   **June 30:** Date the Charlottesville Circuit Court judge granted the default judgment.\n*   **July 11:** Date the city stated it placed all zoning-related applications on hold.\n*   **100 days:** Time frame for the Planning Commission to report findings after its next meeting.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Charlottesville, Virginia:** City that paused zoning approvals after its 2024 ordinance was voided.\n*   **Brian Pinkston:** Charlottesville's vice mayor, who stated the new code aimed to create more housing density.\n*   **City Council:** Unanimously adopted the voided ordinance and is now working to re-adopt it.\n*   **Charlottesville Circuit Court:** Judge from this court granted the default judgment, voiding the ordinance.\n*   **Residents:** Group that sued Charlottesville, leading to the ordinance being voided.\n*   **Planning Commission:** Required to review the amended code and report findings within 100 days.\n*   **University of Virginia:** Charlottesville is home to this university, attracting many students and professionals.\n*   **Maine, Montana, Colorado, Massachusetts:** States mentioned as also reforming zoning for greater housing density.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The city is in talks with the residents' counsel to settle the case or will ask the court to reconsider/file an appeal.\n*   The Planning Commission is required to hold a public hearing and report recommendations to City Council within 100 days after its next meeting.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCharlottesville's development faces uncertainty after a key housing density ordinance was voided.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nAmong its provisions, the bill would\n\nE xempt certain housing projects from environmental reviews previously required under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nEliminate the permanent chassis requirement for manufactured homes, which advocates call a regulatory burden to new construction.\n\nRequire the development of guidelines on state and local zoning within three years to \u201csupport production of adequate housing to meet the needs of communities and provide housing for individuals at every income level.\u201d\n\nThe legislation largely focuses on regulatory changes, but it also establishes an Innovation Fund, a five-year, $200 million grant program for entities that have found demonstrable ways to expand housing supply in their jurisdictions. HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant program, which distributes approximately $3.5 billion annually, would also be refocused to favor \u201clocalities with above-median housing costs and above-median rates of growth\u201d and put new reporting requirements for grant recipients in place, Reason reported.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed rescinding the 2009 \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d which concluded that emissions of six greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. Previous presidential administrations used the finding to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe EPA said in a press release that if the proposal is finalized, it \u201cis expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through \u201cthe repeal of all greenhouse gas standards.\u201d\n\nRescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants would likely give states more leeway in regulating them, said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that in some states we\u2019ll see the state meeting the moment and regulating power plants more robustly. But in some states, we will not. There\u2019s the potential to have a real patchwork of how power plants are regulated.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn 2007, the Supreme Court ruled the EPA must regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act if it determined the emissions endanger public health and welfare. In 2009, the EPA made that determination for the combination of six greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride \u2014 noting that \u201cthe body of scientific evidence compellingly supports this finding.\u201d It used the finding and the Supreme Court ruling to justify greenhouse gas regulation.\n\nBy rescinding this finding, \u201cEPA thinks it has discovered this one neat trick to eliminate all climate regulations,\u201d Meredith Hankins, senior attorney, climate and energy, for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nYesterday\u2019s announcement kicks off a formal rulemaking process with a 45-day period when cities and other stakeholders will be able to comment before the EPA finalizes and publishes the proposed rule, Turner said. \u201cThen there is the opportunity for stakeholders to challenge the rule in court, as is certain to happen in this instance.\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s press release said rescinding the finding will \u201cgive power back to the states to make their own decisions\u201d about greenhouse gas regulations. Some states delegate some of that authority to local governments, Turner said.\n\nThe administration has signaled a desire to block state and local regulation of power plant emissions as well, however. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify all state and local laws and regulations \u201cburdening the identification, development, siting, production, or use of domestic energy resources that are or may be unconstitutional, preempted by Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable\u201d and submit a report within 60 days.\n\nThat report, if it exists, has not been made public, Turner said. But it indicates \u201can appetite from the federal government to go after local governments for climate policies.\u201d\n\nTurner advised city attorneys to take an inventory of their jurisdictions\u2019 climate-related policies and assess the challenges that could be made against them. She said she\u2019s hesitant to advise cities to put a lot of resources into that yet, however, because \u201cso many other things are happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much coming at them, and I think all of this is part and parcel of a bigger story between the administration and cities,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate Mayors\u2019 leadership said in a joint statement Tuesday that the regulations created in response to the endangerment finding \u201chave resulted in better air quality in communities across the country and are central to America\u2019s ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d Those leaders, which include Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego; Boise, Idaho, Mayor Lauren McLean; and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, vowed that \u201cmayors will not back down from our mission to safeguard our residents\u2019 health and build better, safer, and more affordable cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCities have made tremendous progress advancing climate solutions that are both for our planet and our economies,\u201d U.S. Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran said in a statement. \u201cWe do not have to choose one or the other, but we simply cannot retreat. American mayors urge the Administration to reverse this decision and will continue to fight for federal policy that approaches climate change with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "A year after Capital One Financial announced a community benefits program in connection with its proposal to buy Discover Financial Services, the card issuer giant is still short on specifics.\n\nLast July, Capital One announced the eye-popping $265 billion plan to invest in communities where it offers its banking services, in collaboration with the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, NeighborWorks America, the Opportunity Finance Network and the Woodstock Institute. In the months since the plan was announced, the partnering organizations have yet to flesh out the details for the plan\u2019s execution and what it might mean for the people they serve.\n\nImmediately after the plan was announced last July, there were numerous press inquiries and conversations with the company, Woodstock Institute CEO Horacio Mendez said in a May interview. But as the newness of the announcement faded, \u201cthere really wasn\u2019t anything for us to do but wait,\u201d Mendez said.\n\nMeanwhile, critics assert that the community benefits plan dollar figure is inflated, and some worry the bank may not stick to the plan in a political environment that has changed since the re-election of President Donald Trump.\n\nFederal agencies shift gears on CRA\n\nSupport for that fear emerged this month when the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a notice to rescind a 2023 plan to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nThat rule update, proposed during the Biden administration, would have increased regulatory requirements for banks seeking to satisfy the 1977 law aimed at increasing financial inclusion and improving access to credit for low-income and minority communities.\n\nThe rule update was initially scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2024, but after bank groups sued the federal agencies to halt the edict that year, implementation dates for substantive portions of the revised rule were delayed to 2025 and 2026. In March, the Trump administration told an appellate court overseeing the litigation that it would move to rescind the rule update. Aside from increasing regulatory burdens, critics of the rule update have contended it increased uncertainty for banks while the two sides battled in court.\n\nWhile 1995 regulations remain in place for now, the litigation has left banks wondering whether or not they needed to change course, the Fed vice chair for supervision, Michelle Bowman, has said. The older version of the rule gave financial institutions more leeway to balance the needs of local communities with the \u201csafe and sound operation\u201d of their businesses, the three agencies said in their rescission proposal.\n\n\u201cReturning to the 1995 CRA regulations at this time, in staff\u2019s view, would confirm for banks that they do not need to allocate resources toward preparing for the 2023 CRA Final Rule,\u201d the July 16 federal agencies\u2019 proposal said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan?\n\nAs the Trump administration was reversing course on the rule update, Capital One closed its acquisition of Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover in May.\n\nIn conjunction with swallowing the card network, Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan proposed $44 billion in \u201ccommunity development financing,\u201d $600 million for community development financial institutions, and $575 million in philanthropy over five years. In addition, it proposed $200 billion in lending to low- to middle-income consumers; $15 billion for small business lending and $5 billion in \u201cspending with diverse suppliers\u201d over that period, the company said in a July 2024 press release.\n\nThe $600 million directed to the financial institutions for \u201caffordable housing, small business, and consumer lending\u201d was six times what Cap One and Discover had previously planned, the release said.\n\nThough Capital One consulted with the four organizations to develop the plan, it has not yet determined how the plan will be implemented, leaders for the organizations said in interviews.\n\nIn an April interview, Marla Bilonick, president and CEO of the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, said the group would soon be \u201cgetting down to brass tacks and executing on it.\u201d In a follow-up email sent via her spokesperson, Bilonick said this month that NALCAB couldn\u2019t comment further on the status of their talks until after the organization meets with Capital One.\n\nWoodstock\u2019s Mendez noted in May that Capital One had scheduled a meeting in the next week or so to reconnect and discuss the plan\u2019s execution nationally and in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe Woodstock Institute, a research and policy nonprofit focused on \u201ceconomic justice and racial equity within financial systems,\u201d has since had conversations with Capital One in which they discussed possibly arranging town halls with the public to assess the location of a Capital One Caf\u00e9 in Chicago. The bank\u2019s caf\u00e9s are retail branches that double as a place for consumers to grab coffee and food, meet with friends or work on a laptop.\n\nThe nonprofit and the bank also discussed arranging meetings with other local nonprofits and hiring one or two new staffers to manage the bank\u2019s Chicago commitments, Mendez noted in a follow-up email to Payments Dive.\n\nMendez said he has had regular meetings with Capital One\u2019s policy team, and the company is responsive to his calls and emails. \u201cSo far, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about our ability to have honest and challenging communication about stuff that we like and stuff that we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d Mendez said in May.\n\nNeighborWorks America and the Opportunity Finance Network declined multiple requests for comment. Payments Dive filed an open records request with NeighborWorks, a congressionally chartered nonprofit focused on affordable housing, asking for records regarding its involvement in Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan. The organization has not supplied any records responsive to the April 15 request, despite noting on its website that it\u2019s subject to the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nNo specific plan for program dollars\n\nIn an interview, Capital One\u2019s executive vice president and head of external affairs, Andy Navarrete, offered few specifics about implementation of the plan beyond the initial press release. In that June interview, he disputed the notion that the partner organizations weren\u2019t informed about the execution of the community benefits plan. He emphasized that the plan was contingent on the deal closing, noting that just happened in May. By way of explanation, he also underscored the plan\u2019s five-year duration.\n\n\u201cWhen you sort of think about the dollar commitments, they are going to be allocated and implemented over that period of time,\u201d Navarrete said. \u201cSo, it shouldn't be surprising at all that we haven't specifically defined exactly where all of those dollars are going today.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed that it had its kick-off meeting with its partners and plans to work with them to implement the community benefits agreement, but did not disclose when the meeting occurred.\n\n\u201cWith an investment this meaningful, and a five-year deployment plan, we are taking a thoughtful approach and actively working with our community partners to plan the most effective way to invest and drive positive impact,\u201d a spokesperson for the bank said in a follow-up email. \u201cTo date, we have provided meaningfully more transparency into the detail of our plan than any prior CBP negotiated by other parties. We are committed to continuing to be transparent while we deliver in the years to come.\u201d\n\nCapital One has met with its key collaborators, and the company plans to meet with members of its Community Advisory Council, who also contributed to formation of the plan, Navarrete said during the June interview.\n\nAs part of the plan, the Woodstock Institute pushed for Capital One to retain a Discover customer care center in the Chatham neighborhood on Chicago's South Side; to open two caf\u00e9s in Illinois; and to maintain its three current caf\u00e9s in the state, Mendez said. The company has about 60 such caf\u00e9s nationwide, including three in Chicago, according to its website, though the Chicago locations are not in low-income areas.\n\nNavarrete said the company is looking to open another caf\u00e9 elsewhere in Chicago and in other low- and middle-income communities across the country.\n\nCritics question plan implementation\n\nCritics and insiders of Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan have expressed skepticism about whether the company is truly committed to execution of the plan.\n\nCommunity benefits agreements like Capital One\u2019s plan play a role in getting regulatory approval for mergers and acquisitions, said Terri Friedline, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan. (Friedline previously served as an expert witness in an unrelated lawsuit against Capital One, which was later dropped.)\n\nBesides persuading regulators to approve bank mergers, elements of these community benefits plans could generate profits for the bank, Friedline said.\n\n\u201cLending to economically disadvantaged and/or Black and brown communities \u2014 that should already be what banks and other finance companies are doing,\u201d Friedline said. \u201cBut having it in the form of a community benefits agreement means that it sounds like they\u2019re doing something extra, or something that is generous on their part. But it's still an activity that traces back to their own bottom line.\u201d\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 doesn\u2019t mandate that banks implement community benefits agreements, but the pacts serve as a way for communities to hold banks accountable for what they\u2019re required to do under the CRA, she explained.\n\nPast community investment plans include a 2018 Nashville plan for jobs, community services and affordable housing; a $1 billion Denver affordable housing plan in 2005; and a $2.8 billion Atlanta project in 2006, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nSuch plans help bolster the banks\u2019 reputations among their employees and the communities they serve, said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, clinical professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University who is also a former Baxter International CEO and chairman.\n\n\u201cThe larger you are, the more you\u2019re going to have to do to make an impact in terms of people thinking you\u2019re doing something worthwhile,\u201d Kraemer said.\n\nSome critics have said the company\u2019s $265 billion figure is misleading. An analysis of Capital One\u2019s plan by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition asserts that it amounts to $5 billion in new lending, investment and grant activity. The group is a collection of organizations that seek to address racial and socio-economic inequities, particularly with respect to financial well-being.\n\nIn reality, the community benefits plan reflects what both Discover and Capital One were doing prior to the merger, but the $265 billion figure is \u201cmeant to make it look really fancy,\u201d said NCRC Senior Policy Advisor Kevin Hill.\n\nNavarrete said the NCRC\u2019s claim that the $265 billion community benefits plan is not much more than what each company had done before was factually incorrect. Capital One is \u201cthe largest provider of bank uncertified accounts in the country, and we\u2019re increasing our role in that space significantly,\u201d Navarrete said. \u201cWhether you look at this quantitatively or qualitatively, this goes well beyond any [community benefits plan] previously negotiated by any organization.\u201d\n\nWho monitors Capital One\u2019s progress?\n\nNCRC\u2019s Hill raised questions about whether Capital One will uphold its commitments. \u201cThey probably expect the regulators to not pay attention to it past the merger approval if they do walk away,\u201d Hill said.\n\nAn OCC spokesperson said the agency doesn\u2019t monitor compliance with community benefits agreements, nor does it enforce these agreements. The Federal Reserve declined to comment when asked whether it verifies that such agreements are executed.\n\nTo update the public on its progress, Capital One will release an interim report at the end of this year, followed by additional reports in June of the fiscal year after that, Navarrete said.\n\nCapital One\u2019s commitment to financial inclusion is central to its identity, as is providing access to credit for a spectrum of American consumers, the company spokesperson said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Capital One's $265B community plan after Discover merger lacks specifics.\n\n**Key details:** A year after Capital One announced a $265 billion community benefits plan linked to its proposed Discover acquisition, specific execution details remain vague. Partnering organizations await concrete steps, with one CEO noting nothing to do but wait for details on the plan's execution. This situation arises as federal agencies recently rescinded a 2023 plan to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act. Capital One closed its Discover acquisition in May, stating the plan's five-year duration explains the lack of immediate specific dollar allocation.\n\n**Why it matters:** The lack of specific implementation details, despite the plan's initial announcement, challenges the perceived commitment to its $265 billion figure. This is exacerbated by federal agencies' decision to rescind a 2023 rule to modernize the CRA, easing regulatory pressure on banks. Critics suggest the dollar figure is inflated and worry the bank may not adhere to the plan in a changed political environment, especially since regulatory bodies do not monitor or enforce such agreements. This could challenge the view that these large commitments are fully implemented after merger approval.\n\n**The big picture:** Community benefits agreements like Capital One's are often part of gaining regulatory approval for bank mergers and acquisitions. These pacts serve as a way for communities to hold banks accountable for their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The CRA aims to increase financial inclusion and credit access for low-income and minority communities. The Trump administration's reversal on the 2023 CRA rule update means the less stringent 1995 regulations remain, providing banks more operational flexibility.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$265 billion:** Total proposed community benefits plan.\n*   **$200 billion:** Proposed lending to low- to middle-income consumers.\n*   **$600 million:** Directed to community development financial institutions, six times what was previously planned.\n*   **Five years:** Duration over which the community benefits plan commitments will be allocated.\n*   **1995:** The current Community Reinvestment Act regulations remaining in place.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Capital One Financial:** Card issuer giant that acquired Discover and announced a $265 billion community benefits plan.\n*   **Discover Financial Services:** Recently acquired by Capital One; retention of its customer care center was sought.\n*   **Horacio Mendez:** CEO of Woodstock Institute, expressed waiting for plan details and reconnecting with Capital One.\n*   **Federal Reserve Board:** One of the federal agencies that issued notice to rescind the 2023 CRA modernization plan.\n*   **National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC):** Group asserting Capital One's $265 billion plan amounts to $5 billion in new activity.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Capital One plans to release an interim report on its progress by the end of this year.\n*   Additional reports will follow in June of the fiscal year after that.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Capital One's post-merger community plan faces execution doubts amid regulatory shifts.",

        "summary_text": "A transformative shift is underway in American healthcare.\n\nHealthcare systems and human service programs have traditionally operated on a reactive model: treating health issues only after they become (expensive) crises. In recent years, entities across all verticals of the health industry are shifting toward a proactive, data-driven care model.\n\nWhen done well, the strategy significantly reduces healthcare spending and duplication of effort by identifying and addressing non-medical and economic needs that influence health long before they escalate, enabling upstream interventions that save lives and dollars.\n\nBuilding the robust technology backbone for this new type of digital ecosystem\u2014one with secure communication and coordinated analytics\u2014was historically a challenge. Today, these powerful tools have become widely accessible, empowering entities of all sizes, from county governments to individual health providers.\n\nIn fact, in the hands of more local entities, this forward-thinking approach does more than make healthcare delivery more efficient. It fosters collaboration with local health and human service partners and community-based organizations (CBOs), creating many more unique and tailored avenues for data-driven interventions.\n\nThis keeps everyone on the same page, eliminating silos, duplication, and most importantly, focuses on the outcome. In addition to healthcare savings, this can generate savings within other programs dedicated to human wellbeing, all while improving individuals\u2019 economic stability.\n\nThe results of this model are not just theoretical.\n\nSummit County, Ohio: Summit County\u2019s NEXT Program enhanced operational efficiency and produced major savings. The local government saved an estimated $3 million in its first year by increasing financial security among participants, reducing their reliance on public benefits. At the same time, 88% of end users reported that program capacity grew and more than two-thirds reported improved community collaboration. It also improved other services. The local government freed up 591 administrative hours annually, and local non-governmental community organizations received $190,000 for their services.\n\nSouthwest, Virginia: In a study done in collaboration with the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, Ballad Health reported an estimated $825,000 in annualized cost savings per 1,000 patients based on reduced emergency department utilization alone. Fifty-nine percent of participants in this program were insured by Medicaid.\n\nUpstate New York: The Healthy Eating Pilot Program showed a possible savings of up to 13% in total healthcare costs. This pilot connected those with Type 2 Diabetes to medically appropriate food assistance. Fifty percent of participants lowered their A1C levels and had one more \u201chealthy day\u201d a month, making them able to do more.\n\nThe Blueprint for Proactive, Affordable Care\n\nWhen assessing ways to generate outcomes like those above for your constituency, there are three key areas to design for:\n\nLeverage Data for Early Intervention: By integrating data from health and community care services, your agencies can proactively identify individuals at high risk for negative health outcomes. This enables timely support that prevents costly emergency care, reduces long-term healthcare expenditures, and maintains stability for the individual so they can be self-sustaining.\n\nImplement Proactive Care Management: To significantly reduce health outcomes, especially post-discharge, it is critical to ensure that patients are connected to essential community-based services, such as access to nutritious food and behavioral health. Program after program proves simply providing an individual with a list of services doesn\u2019t work\u2014supporting their connection to the services pays for itself many times over.\n\nOptimize Resource Allocation: By creating a clear, comprehensive view of population needs, you can more accurately forecast demand for services. This ensures taxpayer dollars and public resources are directed where they will have the greatest impact. This same mechanism also allows for straightforward assessments of what is working and what isn\u2019t.\n\nUltimately, this shift toward proactive care is not just about fiscal responsibility; it's about delivering better, more personalized services. While the concept is now gaining national attention, it has been a reality for Unite Us for over a decade.\n\nUnite Us was founded in 2013 by two military veterans, Dan Brillman and Taylor Justice, who saw firsthand how their peers struggled to navigate a fragmented landscape of resources. They set out to build a technology platform that could create a \"no wrong door\" approach, first for veterans and now for everyone.\n\nReady to shift from reactive to proactive?

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPresident Donald Trump has employed several powers of the executive branch to enact a wide range of tariffs, including country-specific levies scheduled to return Aug. 1. However, Trump's future use of tariffs as a negotiating tool is likely to be determined in the courts, where several states and businesses plan to argue that he lacks the statutory authority to impose sweeping tariffs on all countries that trade with the U.S.\n\nOne of the critical proceedings challenging Trump's tariff use began Thursday. The administration is facing off against lawyers from five companies and 12 states before 11 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The court will decide whether to lift its stay of a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that blocked Trump's broad use of duties, including a global 10% baseline tariff and various other country-specific levies, without congressional approval.\n\nThe case, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v Trump, is one of several lawsuits with plaintiffs fighting tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Here\u2019s a look at five such cases and where they currently stand:\n\nOn April 14, V.O.S. Selections and four other import companies sued the Trump administration in the USCIT, claiming the president exceeded his statutory authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by imposing tariffs without congressional authorization.\n\nThe plaintiffs also claimed that the tariffs hurt them financially by increasing costs and disrupting their operations.\n\nOn April 23, 12 states filed a parallel lawsuit, mainly making the same arguments. So, the USCIT consolidated the two cases, and a three-judge panel ruled on May 28 that the president had no authority to impose across-the-board tariffs under the IEEPA. As a result of the findings, the USCIT issued a permanent injunction against future tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which issued a temporary stay on the injunction while considering the appeal. Oral arguments for the case are scheduled to begin Thursday.\n\nThe hearing is unusual because all 11 judges will hear arguments en banc, instead of via a more typical three-judge panel. An en banc hearing is reserved for cases of exceptional importance and indicates the judges want a ruling reflecting the view of the entire court.\n\nOn April 22, Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc., two small businesses specializing in educational products, filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump's tariffs under the IEEPA.\n\nA judge from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction on May 29, preventing the Trump administration from collecting IEEPA tariffs from the two plaintiffs. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (CADC) granted the administration's request for a stay until it could rule on the case's merits.\n\nOn April 16, California sued Trump in the U.S. District Court of Northern California, challenging the president's authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA. The suit alleges the tariffs exceed Trump's presidential authority and have caused significant harm to California's economy, businesses and consumers.\n\nA District Court judge in June dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the suit belonged in the USCIT. California then sought appellate review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A decision is pending.\n\nOn April 11, Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard, both citizens of the Blackfeet Nation, sued the U.S. and the U.S. Homeland Security Department, challenging executive orders and proclamations that imposed new tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from Canada. The plaintiffs filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the tariff orders, claiming they exceeded presidential and statutory authority under the IEEPA and Trade Expansion Act. The suit also claimed no clear foreign threat justified the sweeping tariffs, as the Trump administration claimed.\n\nThe case also says that Trump's actions breach two treaties signed by the U.S. government: the 1794 Jay Treaty and the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, which exempted indigenous trade from duties, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe district court granted the government's request to transfer the case to the USCIT on April 25, ruling the suit belonged in the specialized court. The plaintiffs appealed the transfer order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied the request.\n\nOn May 16, Axle of Dearborn, which does business as Detroit Axle, filed a lawsuit in the USCIT against the Commerce Department and three other federal agencies, challenging the legality of several executive orders eliminating the de minimis exemption.\n\nThe Michigan-based automotive parts distributor argues that the president lacks the statutory and constitutional authority to revoke the exemption, which allows duty-free importation of goods valued at less than $800. The company called on the court to block multiple executive orders implementing tariffs and banning the exemption.\n\nThe government argues that the president has the power under the IEEPA and the U.S. Constitution to take \"emergency\" actions, including withdrawing the de minimis exemption as part of a response to international trade threats.\n\nThe Trump administration requested a halt to the proceedings until the V.O.S. Selections case is resolved. On July 28, the USCIT granted the stay.",

The overall investment aims to help Mars meet demand and provide capabilities for new and innovated products.\n\n**Why it matters:** This investment aims to build a stronger, more resilient Mars business in its largest U.S. market, which is a key engine of growth. It should help Mars meet demand and provide capabilities for new product additions and innovation. The investment includes a significant facility for Nature's Bakery, which saw a 30% volume increase last year, bucking the broader slowdown in the snack bar category. This move signals Mars is strategically investing in a segment that defies market trends, potentially challenging a consensus view on the overall snack bar industry.\n\n**The big picture:** Mars, best known for M&M\u2019s and Snickers, already manufactures 94% of its U.S. products locally. The company previously spent $6 billion over the past five years expanding its manufacturing footprint. Beyond candy, Mars has a large presence in pet food and snack bars, having acquired Nature's Bakery in 2020. Mars is also in the process of buying snacking giant Kellanova for nearly $36 billion.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$2 billion:** Mars' planned investment by the end of 2026.\n*   **$6 billion:** Amount Mars spent on manufacturing expansion in the past five years.\n*   **94%:** Of Mars\u2019 U.S. products sold are manufactured locally.\n*   **$240 million:** Investment for the new Nature's Bakery facility in Utah.\n*   **30%:** Increase in Nature's Bakery volume during the prior year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Mars:** Food giant planning a $2 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and innovation by 2026.\n*   **Claus Aagaard:** Mars\u2019 CFO, stated the investment builds a stronger, more resilient U.S. business.\n*   **Nature's Bakery:** Mars-owned soft-baked snack bar brand receiving a new $240 million facility in Utah.\n*   **Kellanova:** Snacking giant Mars is in the process of acquiring for nearly $36 billion.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The new Nature's Bakery facility in Utah is opening Wednesday.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Mars doubles down on U.S. production and innovation for future growth.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMerck & Co. is looking to make a comeback in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nEli Lilly, Biogen and Eisai have outpaced the Big Pharma field in bringing new drugs to market, but now Merck is betting on the next wave of Alzheimer\u2019s treatments by homing in on biomarkers and other precision medicine techniques for patients in earlier stages.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s drug landscape keeps evolving, and companies like Merck have had to change their approach along with it. So while anti-amyloid drugs like Biogen and Eisai\u2019s Leqembi and Lilly\u2019s Kisunla showcase solid yet incremental improvement, a new slate of candidates could make up the next stage of disease prevention and treatment.\n\nMerck has moved two of those drug candidates to phase 2 trials, including a tau-targeting antibody called MK-2214 and a neurotransmitter modulator called MK-1167. And although many of the complexities surrounding Alzheimer\u2019s persist, Merck is doubling down on recent advances to more effectively target the core pathologies of the disease.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field,\u201d said Dr. Mike Egan, vice president of neuroscience global clinical development at Merck. \u201cWhat drugs are we going after, and what is the appropriate disease stage in terms of selecting drug targets? That\u2019s been greatly informed by advances in genetics and our understanding of what might be an opportune target to hit, as well as advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.\u201d\n\nAmid lower sales forecasts, Merck this week said it will begin a cost-saving plan involving layoffs and focus on newer drug launches to overcome the looming patent loss for cancer blockbuster Keytruda in the next couple years. A renewed emphasis on neuroscience appears to be part of that forward-looking strategy.\n\nThese two candidates will carry what Merck neuroscience leaders hope is a resurgence in the pharma\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s prowess into a new era, catching up to rivals and bringing effective treatments to the challenging arena.\n\nLearning from history\n\nThe current roster of Alzheimer\u2019s drug hopefuls isn\u2019t Merck\u2019s first stroll around the block. Along with many drugmakers still targeting the memory-stealing disease, the company walks a path littered with failures.\n\nBack before the first anti-amyloid approvals of the early 2020s, Merck and fellow pharma giants were all aiming at a different target altogether: the BACE inhibitor. One by one, though, as Merck ended its BACE inhibitor program in 2018 due to poor efficacy, so did the other drugmakers, including bigwigs like Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Novartis and Eisai.\n\nThis time around, Merck\u2019s understanding of the disease\u2019s targets has improved to the point that the company is better prepared to bring the drugs through trials, said Jonathan Sugam, principal scientist of neuroscience discovery at Merck.\n\n\u201cAdvances in the field over the past decade or so have taken us toward what we think are the most appropriate targets based on both genetically validated targets in the appropriate disease population, as well as targets we think are most viable based on what we\u2019ve learned about the biomarkers that describe the pathophysiology of the disease, tau being one of the big ones,\u201d Sugam said.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field.\" Dr. Mike Egan VP, neuroscience, global clinical development, Merck & Co.\n\nAlong with many of the companies licking their BACE inhibitor wounds from almost 10 years ago, Merck learned some important lessons about the approach to Alzheimer\u2019s. From trial design to viable endpoints to the balance of speed and precision, Egan said that \u201cit\u2019s important to continue to invest in Alzheimer\u2019s disease to get clear, strong biomarker evidence of target engagement and disease biology before going to big phase 3 trials.\u201d\n\nThat perspective is critical as the company moves ahead with these two candidates, and Sugam said Merck is better prepared this time. Alzheimer\u2019s trials are notoriously difficult to recruit and enroll because of the complexity of the disease, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better equipped now than we were previously to identify the right patient at the right time for the right therapy,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cUsing biomarkers to identify and track patients appropriately in a trial \u2026 is one of the biggest innovations in the field.\u201d\n\nTau and PAM\n\nMK-2214 is designed to clear tau tangles in the brain, which, along with amyloid plaques, are considered one of the hallmarks of the disease. But unlike some other drugs that clear tau, the antibody takes aim not just at the protein itself but also its mechanism of spreading to different regions of the brain, making it a potential prevention in pre-symptomatic patients.\n\nThat process begins with the specific target pS413, which is a type of extracellular tau associated with accumulation of the protein in the brain. By tracking these tau \u201cseeds\u201d as they spread, Merck researchers have found that an antibody can more effectively root out drivers of the disease than a more general tau inhibitor.\n\n\u201cWe can actually see the progression of this tau over time in different brain regions and stage the disease appropriately,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cWe believe, along with others, that this pathological spreading of tau is a key driver of some of the disease process and some of the symptomology of the disease \u2014 being able to target that with an antibody like MK-2214 is something we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\n\nAnd by targeting the \u201cseeds\u201d of corruption in the brain, MK-2214 could potentially be used earlier in patients who show tau accumulation without the telltale symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s such as cognitive decline, Egan said. That also determines the window in which patients will be included in clinical trials.\n\n\u201cA key question is, when does the seeding occur? It probably occurs early,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe have to take a Goldilocks approach, similar to how Lilly conducted [Kisunla] trials in people with moderate amounts of tau, as opposed to too much or not enough \u2014 people who haven\u2019t had tau seeded to all their cortical neurons.\u201d\n\nOn top of MK-2214, Merck is also in mid-stage trials for a drug candidate that takes a wholly different approach. MK-1167 is an alpha-7 positive allosteric modulator, known as PAM, that targets and turns on a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. By bringing acetylcholine back online, MK-1167 could improve cognitive function in patients already experiencing symptoms.\n\nLeaning into the company\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s resurgence, Egan said there\u2019s room for more molecules in the pipeline \u2014 and Merck is willing to open the purse strings for the right prospect, employing M&A or partnerships to bolster the portfolio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to say to the world that if you have good Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, feel free to touch base with us, because we have both an internal pipeline and an external pipeline \u2014 nobody has a monopoly on good ideas,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe want to pursue new medications that could help patients, whether it\u2019s for disease modification or cognition or symptomatic approaches.\u201d",

While Novo was the star of the emerging weight loss and diabetes market through its GLP-1s Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly took over the majority of the market officially earlier this year thanks to growing popularity for Zepbound and Wegovy. The switchup brought Novo back to the drawing board for a rebound.\n\nThis week, while naming its new CEO, the company also cut its guidance for 2025 from a sales increase of 13% to 21% to between 8% and 14% after slower-than-expected uptake of its GLP-1 products. Doustdar is now tasked with the challenge of navigating Novo\u2019s new era as the second-place obesity leader, grappling with slower growth, potential incoming competitors and compounded versions of its drugs still available on the cheap for some patients.\n\nDoustdar has been with Novo for more than 30 years, most recently serving as executive vice president of international operations after getting his start as an office clerk in Vienna during the 1990s. He oversaw the launch of Novo\u2019s GLP-1s in several countries, and could tighten up the ship with workforce cuts once at the helm in August, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI come to this role with a sense of urgency, a laser focus on high performance, and a fierce determination for Novo Nordisk to aim higher than it\u2019s ever done,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAmid the changes at the top, Novo also restructured its R&D, combining two divisions into one, which will be led by the company\u2019s newly appointed chief scientist, Dr. Martin Holst Lange.\n\nKenvue\u2019s shaky future\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s decision to spin off its consumer health business in 2023 followed a wave of similar moves by major pharma companies such as Sanofi and GSK. The goal was to streamline, simplify and refocus on the business of innovating drugs.\n\nBut since going it alone, J&J\u2019s spinoff Kenvue has struggled to find its footing as a mammoth, multi-faceted company with a broad OTC drug portfolio including stalwarts such as Tylenol and Benadryl, along with household favorite brands like Aveeno and Listerine.\n\nSeveral headwinds \u2014 including falling sales at retail pharmacies \u2014 have triggered pressure from activist investors to make a change. Starboard Value already has a seat on the company\u2019s board, and earlier this year Third Point and Toms Capital bought up more of its stock.\n\nWith Kenvue in the midst of a strategic review, CEO Thibaut Mongon was ousted suddenly this month and replaced by interim head Kirk Perry, the company\u2019s board director. While the company touted Perry\u2019s 30 years of leadership in consumer packaged goods, it said an executive search firm has been hired to lead the quest for its next permanent CEO.\n\nIn its preliminary earnings report for the most recent quarter, Kenvue said it expects a 4% sales drop.\n\nNews of the shift has fueled investor speculation that Kenvue is preparing to sell some of its brands or setting the stage for an outright acquisition of the company, which is currently valued at $40 billion.\n\nJazz sings new tune with CEO switch\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals made history by scoring the first FDA approval for a CBD-based drug in 2018. Now, Epidiolex, which is indicated for two rare forms of epilepsy, is on its way to crossing the blockbuster threshold this year, providing an ample revenue cushion for the company\u2019s ongoing pursuit of M&A.\n\nBut Jazz\u2019s next big act could be in oncology. The Ireland-based biopharma picked up Chimerix this year for $935 million to nab a brain tumor candidate, potentially building on a portfolio that also includes a HER2-targeting bispecific antibody that\u2019s already won an accelerated approval in one cancer indication and is being studied in several more. Citeline has pegged the treatment, Ziihera, as a potential blockbuster.\n\nWith its future coming into sharper focus, Jazz announced new leadership plans this month. Ren\u00e9e Gal\u00e1 will step into the CEO role in August as former CEO Bruce Cozadd retires. Gal\u00e1, who became the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer in 2023 and brings over 30 years of industry experience to the post, has played a \u201ccritical role in driving Jazz\u2019s ongoing transformation.\u201d",

This reduction is attributed to slower-than-expected uptake of its GLP-1 products. Following these announcements, Novo shares plunged over 20%, marking its largest single-day drop ever recorded.\n\n**Why it matters:** Novo Nordisk's leadership change and reduced sales forecast dashed hopes of boosted confidence in the company's future. The stock's record single-day drop signals significant investor concern over the revised growth outlook. This challenges any previous consensus that Novo would maintain its dominant market position, as it now grapples with slower GLP-1 uptake. The company is now navigating a new era as the \"second-place obesity leader\" after its \"descent back to earth.\"\n\n**The big picture:** The pharmaceutical industry broadly faces market challenges, including regulatory changes, potential tariffs, and patent cliffs. Novo Nordisk had been a star in the emerging weight loss and diabetes market with Ozempic and Wegovy. However, Eli Lilly took over the majority of this market earlier this year.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDr. Vinay Prasad, the controversial head of the FDA office that oversees vaccines and gene therapy, has abruptly left the agency after less than three months on the job.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the HHS, confirmed Prasad\u2019s departure in an emailed statement Tuesday. \u201cDr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California to be with his family,\u201d Nixon wrote. \u201cWe thank him for his service and the many reforms he was able to achieve in his time at the FDA.\u201d\n\nThe news was reported earlier by the Pink Sheet and Endpoints News.\n\nPrasad\u2019s exit marks a sudden end to his tumultuous tenure as director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, with in addition to vaccines and some genetic medicines also reviews blood products.\n\nA prolific academic and longtime critic of U.S. drug policies, Prasad was appointed as the head of CBER on May 6. At the time, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary called his hiring a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d for CBER, as Prasad brought the \u201cscientific rigor, independence and transparency\u201d the office needed, he claimed.\n\nMakary later named Prasad as the FDA\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer, in addition to his role at CBER.\n\nPrasad was a vocal opponent of his predecessor Dr. Peter Marks, who ran CBER for nearly a decade before resigning in March after a dispute with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Marks championed regulatory flexibility while at the FDA and, as head of CBER, oversaw the review and approvals of COVID-19 vaccines as well as dozens of cell and gene therapies. Prasad previously criticized many of those decisions and, notably, had castigated Marks for overruling FDA reviewers in clearing Sarepta Therapeutics\u2019 Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy Elevidys.\n\nPrasad\u2019s appointment had raised questions among many biotech companies and investors that FDA standards might be shifting. After joining the FDA, Prasad quickly worked with Makary to establish stricter approval guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines. He also three times stepped in to overrule other agency reviewers in issuing narrower-than-requested clearances for COVID shots developed by Moderna and Novavax.\n\nAt a round table meeting hosted by the FDA in early June, Prasad attempted to ease concerns CBER might be less flexible under his watch in regulating gene therapies for rare conditions.\n\n\u201cWe understand that progress is not always made in a single leap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will consider incremental steps forward, because those add up.\u201d\n\nA month later, the FDA rejected a Duchenne cell therapy from Capricor Therapeutics that Prasad reportedly scrutinized. Shortly afterwards, the FDA engaged in an unusual public standoff with Sarepta over its Duchenne gene therapy Elevidys. Following the deaths of two Elevidys recipients \u2014 as well as the death of a study volunteer who received a different gene therapy \u2014 the agency asked Sarepta to halt all shipments of its treatment. After initially defying the request, Sarepta agreed, and published reports suggested the company might need new safety data before the FDA would allow Elevidys back on the market.\n\nBut in the ensuing days, Prasad was targeted by right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, other conservative commentators and in op-eds published in The Wall Street Journal. One Journal op-ed criticized him as being a \u201cBernie Sanders acolyte in MAHA drag\u201d and a \u201cone-man death panel.\u201d Another argued his decisionmaking suggested he believes \u201cpeople can\u2019t be trusted to make their own decisions about risks and benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen the FDA suddenly allowed Sarepta to resume some shipments of Elevidys on Monday, some Wall Street analysts speculated higher-ups within the Trump administration had stepped in.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a resignation in the short term,\u201d Baird analyst Brian Skorney wrote in a note to investors on Monday.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRoche\u2019s efforts to break into the lucrative obesity market haven\u2019t abated. The pharma giant sealed the largest deal in the space earlier this year when it announced a collaboration with Zealand Pharma for more than $5 billion. The agreement built on Roche\u2019s $2.7 billion deal to pick up Carmot Therapeutics and its suite of early- and mid-stage obesity candidates in 2023.\n\nAfter shelling out to get into the race, the Swiss pharma\u2019s strategy to enter the market with differentiated assets is becoming clearer as the drugs move through the clinic.\n\nNow, the Swiss pharma is revealing more about its long-term pipeline plans and potential move to join the ranks of other Big Pharma companies in the direct-to-patient space.\n\nObesity pipeline\n\nRoche\u2019s lead obesity candidate, CT-388, is a weekly injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Currently in phase 2, the drug has already shown promising weight loss results. In a phase 1b trial, patients lost an average of 18.8% over 24 weeks.\n\nThe company plans to announce a phase 3 study in obesity for the drug later this year, according to its most recent earnings presentation. In addition, Roche wants to study CT-388 combined with petrelintide, a mid-stage amylin analog it licensed in its deal with Zealand.\n\n\u201cBoth petrelintide and CT-388 are currently in phase 2 studies, and we will need to review the results of those two monotherapy studies before we can share very specific timelines and details for the phase 2 combination,\u201d said Teresa Graham, Roche\u2019s CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the company\u2019s innovative medicines arm, on an earnings call. \u201cHowever, our expectation is that we will be moving into combo initiation in 2026.\u201d\n\nThe combo therapy plan was part of the original deal with Zealand. The company was previously studying a combination of an early-stage asset CT-173 with CT-388. But Roche revealed that it\u2019s cutting CT-173 from its pipeline in the earnings report.\n\nThe candidate, a long-acting peptide YY analog that had not yet entered human trials, was picked up in the Carmot acquisition. The drug aimed to control appetite by targeting the PYY hormone, and Roche had originally planned to enter phase 1 testing this year before axing it.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to discontinue CT-173 \u2026 based on a comprehensive assessment of its developability, competitive positioning and commercial viability,\u201d Graham said.\n\nRoche is also exploring an oral GLP-1 that could give the company a competitive edge if it enters the obesity market down the line. With one early-stage asset off the books, Roche still has several options in the works.\n\n\"Overall with our obesity portfolio \u2026 we still feel very confident that we have a potentially best in disease and highly competitive portfolio of products,\u201d Graham said on a separate call with media last week.\n\nA DTC play?\n\nRoche may also take a page from Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which all launched DTC platforms for certain medications, including obesity and diabetes drugs.\n\nWhile other pharmas have also created DTC channels, Lilly and Novo\u2019s offerings launched amid an exploding market with insurance coverage challenges. Via the DTC platforms, the meds are available for about half the price in a vial format. Bristol Myers Squibb also recently announced it was working to sell its blood thinner medication Eliquis, which is co-owned with Pfizer, directly to patients.\n\nThe platforms not only offer some patients a cheaper price, they also fall in line with a Trump administration priority to lower drug prices by enabling DTC pharma sales at the \u201cmost-favored nation cost.\u201d The policy, as outlined in a May executive order from President Donald Trump, asks drugmakers to sell medications at the lowest price paid by an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country with a GDP per capita that\u2019s at least 60% of the U.S. measure.\n\nRoche is now considering its own DTC platform that would comply with the Trump administration\u2019s DTC desires. According to executives, the platform would potentially offer its future obesity products.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the BMS, Pfizer-type direct to patient, I think this is absolutely something that we would consider for the right product,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd one might imagine that this could be a really good type of program that you would use with your obesity assets.\u201d\n\nRoche Group CEO Thomas Schinecker added that DTC could also work for some of its other drugs, but he didn\u2019t go into detail about plans to launch its own platform and noted the company is in talks with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThere are other areas as well where we can do that, but these are discussions that we are having with the U.S. government,\u201d he said during the call.",

That\u2019s a huge drop in pace from 2021\u2019s peak of 309 total funds for the year.\n\nBut this downturn actually represents a post-bubble rightsizing of the market that will open up new opportunities not only for investors, but for promising technologies, according to Otello Stampacchia, Omegas\u2019 founder and managing director.\n\n\u201cThis creates a very good background for investing at great prices, in great companies,\u201d Stampacchia said.\n\nOther investors echo that sentiment.\n\nWhen Deerfield Management Company closed its latest healthcare innovations fund of over $600 million in May, the firm\u2019s managing partner, James Flynn, said there\u2019s \u201cnever been a better time to invest in new and evolving technologies and products across the life science, medical technology and healthcare service landscape.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with PharmaVoice, he elaborated on why the time felt right.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through a several-year period where valuations have gone down and competition for new assets has gone down, from an investment standpoint [that\u2019s] a good thing,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen you combine that with what are continual advances and knowledge of biology, continual advances in discovery tools, your ability to take those things forward in a cost effective and direct way improves.\u201d\n\nBiotech\u2019s new era of opportunity\n\nIt was actually harder to invest during the last biotech bubble because of so much \u201cnoise\u201d from competing investors, Stampacchia said.\n\n\u201cThere was so much enthusiasm from, in some cases, non-sophisticated, non-biotech specialist investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was actually a bit counterproductive.\u201d\n\nNot only were valuations \u201ca bit out of whack,\u201d but \u201cdiligence times were shorter, companies were awash in opportunity to get new investors in and discipline also went a bit out of the window,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy.\" Otello Stampacchia Founder, managing director, Omega Funds\n\nThe bubble could only burst after that glut of investing.\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a period of excess in 2019, 2020, where valuations went up very sharply and lots of companies that probably shouldn't have gone public went public,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen the correction occurred, none of them could raise money. They were all burning a huge amount of cash.\u201d\n\nStampacchia echoed this.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many public companies to attract investors\u2019 attention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a while, but there\u2019s been a steady reduction in those companies. Some of the great ones have been acquired. Some of the good ones will be acquired. Some of the terrible ones have done reverse mergers or returned cash to shareholders.\u201d\n\nCertainly technologies suffered from overhype, too.\n\n\u201cI think all the CRISPR craze was probably overdone,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cA whole bunch of companies went public. Some of them are continuing to progress, and we're starting to see some drugs out of them, but they became extremely heavily valued and had very high cash-burn with pretty speculative types of targets.\u201d\n\nStampacchia agrees that \u201cin today\u2019s environment, we think some modalities are trickier to justify\u201d and points to cell therapy as an example, thanks to \u201chuge logistic challenges, costs and difficulties to convert a certain type of physicians.\u201d\n\nAlthough Omega successfully invested in some early cell and gene therapy companies, Stampacchia said momentum in that arena has \u201cslowed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the bar is super high for us in that space,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sector\u2019s future\n\nAlthough there\u2019s still a lot of instability in the biotech market due to government funding cuts and policy uncertainty, investors who\u2019ve weathered the storm are being \u201cjudicious\u201d about where they put their money and attention.\n\n\u201cYou need to be disciplined. You need to know what you\u2019re doing. You need to really have a capacity of discerning great individuals and great drugs, which is not a given,\u201d Stampacchia said, noting that since its 2004 founding, Omega Funds has raised $2.5 billion and its portfolio companies launched 52 commercialized products.\n\nNow, with its newest $647 million Fund VIII \u2014 which exceeded its $600 million target \u2014 Omega aims to create and invest in life sciences companies in the U.S. and Europe that target severe, unmet medical needs.\n\nSpecifically, Omega will continue to be active in oncology and immunology, as well as some rare diseases, Stampacchia said. They\u2019re also \u201ccautiously\u201d making investments in the cardiometabolic space by being \u201cthoughtful\u201d about the unmet need.\n\nWhile Deerfield invests more widely across the healthcare space, Flynn said its areas of interest are very \u201cgenetics driven\u201d and include oncology and immunology.\n\nThe other four funds cited in PitchBook\u2019s report were from Ocampo Capital, Foundation Capital, 4BIO Capital and F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth. Although each of these new funds may face challenges, the downturn is likely good for the market in the long run.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy,\u201d Stampacchia said.",

        "summary": "**Large VC funds buck biotech downturn, seeing prime investment opportunities.**\n\n**Key details:**\nVenture capital firm Omega Funds recently closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs, defying a broad industry trend of declining investment. Biotech investors closed only four venture capital funds in Q1 2025, a significant drop from 309 in 2021. Deerfield Management Company also closed a healthcare innovations fund exceeding $600 million in May. Both firms view this downturn as a \"post-bubble rightsizing\" of the market, which creates favorable conditions for investing in promising technologies at better prices. They believe reduced valuations and competition make it an ideal time to deploy capital.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis development challenges the prevailing narrative of a universal downturn in biotech investment by showcasing large funds actively deploying capital. It suggests that while overall fund closures are down, sophisticated investors like Omega Funds and Deerfield Management see current market conditions as strategic for high-quality investments. They believe the \"cleansing period\" following a bubble offers a healthy environment to acquire assets that were previously overvalued or difficult to access due to excessive competition. This contrarian view highlights potential opportunities for investors able to discern great individuals and drugs during instability.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe biotech industry has experienced a swift downturn in investing since a peak about five years ago, marked by a significant reduction in venture capital fund closures. This downturn followed a period of \"excess\" in 2019-2020, characterized by sharp valuation increases, numerous companies going public prematurely, and \"non-sophisticated\" investors creating market \"noise.\" The bubble led to overhyped technologies like CRISPR and cell therapy facing high valuations and cash burn, with many public companies later struggling to raise money. This current \"cleansing period\" is seen as necessary to correct market imbalances and restore discipline.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Omega Funds closed a $647 million fund (Fund VIII).\n*   Biotech investors closed just four venture capital funds in Q1 2025.\n*   This represents a drop from 309 total funds closed in 2021.\n*   Deerfield Management Company closed a fund of over $600 million.\n*   Omega Funds has raised $2.5 billion since its 2004 founding; its portfolio companies launched 52 commercialized products.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Omega Funds:** Venture capital firm that closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs, bucking an industry trend.\n*   **Otello Stampacchia:** Founder and managing director of Omega Funds, who believes the downturn provides excellent investment opportunities.\n*   **Deerfield Management Company:** Healthcare innovations firm that closed its latest healthcare innovations fund of over $600 million.\n*   **James Flynn:** Managing partner at Deerfield Management, who believes it is an excellent time to invest in new technologies.\n*   **PitchBook:** Data provider that reported the significant drop in biotech venture capital fund closures.\n*   **PharmaVoice:** Interviewed James Flynn on why the current market feels right for investment.\n*   **Ocampo Capital:** Mentioned as one of the other four funds cited in PitchBook's Q1 2025 report.\n*   **Foundation Capital:** Mentioned as one of the other four funds cited in PitchBook's Q1 2025 report.\n*   **4BIO Capital:** Mentioned as one of the other four funds cited in PitchBook's Q1 2025 report.\n*   **F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth:** Mentioned as one of the other four funds cited in PitchBook's Q1 2025 report.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDisciplined VCs find opportunity in biotech downturn's \"cleansing period.\"",

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said tariffs as high as 200% on pharma products would be introduced \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nOther industry shifts, including the growing GLP-1 market and the demand for skilled workers in pharma\u2019s tech-heavy manufacturing environment, are also tipping the scales toward the U.S.\n\nAmid the investment boom, tens of billions of dollars are pouring into manufacturing hubs like Raleigh, North Carolina, and generating thousands of job openings for engineers, R&D personnel, operations professionals and more.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the latest companies to hop on the U.S. manufacturing bandwagon.\n\nAstraZeneca makes its largest-ever single facility investment\n\nAstraZeneca joined the $50 billion club this month when it announced a sprawling manufacturing and R&D investment in the U.S. The size of the investment matches the other leading pledges from pharma companies this year \u2014 including Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly \u2014 to each pump $50 billion or more into U.S. facilities.\n\nCEO Pascal Soroit acknowledged that tariffs played a part in the U.K.-based company\u2019s decision to pump up its U.S. operations in a recent interview with Fortune, but also noted that Europe is \u201closing ground\u201d as a drug production destination by focusing on \u201csocial benefits and managing costs.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s plan includes $4 billion for a drug substance facility in Virginia \u2014 its largest single-facility manufacturing investment in the world. But the $50 billion in funds will stretch across the country and include an R&D expansion in Maryland, a continuous manufacturing expansion in Indiana, a next-generation cell therapy facility in Texas, a \u201cstate of the art\u201d R&D center in Massachusetts\u2019 biotech hub at Kendall Square and more.\n\nThe American market for drugs also plays a starring role in the company\u2019s broader ambitions. All told, AstraZeneca aims to boost its total revenue from the $54 billion-mark it hit in 2024 to over $80 billion by 2030 \u2014 half of which it expects to be generated in the U.S., the company said.\n\nBiogen pours more into North Carolina\n\nBiogen is broadening its manufacturing footprint in North Carolina. The company said it will invest $2 billion into two campuses in the state\u2019s Research Triangle Park, Biogen\u2019s current hub for manufacturing.\n\nThe fresh funds will expand Biogen\u2019s capacity for multiple modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides, while modernizing its operations with automation and AI.\n\nBiogen is still working to move past its Aduhelm debacle. The Eisai-partnered Alzheimer\u2019s drug notched a historic approval in 2021 but was later pulled from the market amid cost and efficacy controversies.\n\nIts other Alzheimer\u2019s treatment Leqembi has had a stronger showing on the market and has steadily risen in sales since last year. But Biogen has also been in cost-cutting mode since 2023 and expects revenue to decline this year.\n\nGoing forward, the company is leaning on its pipeline, including treatments for Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, to set the stage for future growth.\n\nIts latest manufacturing investment adds to the $10 billion it has funneled into North Carolina since setting up shop at Research Triangle Park in 1995.\n\nThermo Fisher snags Sanofi facility to boost fill-finish chops\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific is expanding its production prowess with the help of a growing Sanofi partnership.\n\nThe companies said this month that Thermo Fisher is snapping up a sterile, fill-finish manufacturing site from the French pharma for an undisclosed sum. The move comes amid higher-than-expected profit last quarter for Thermo Fisher, one of the pharma industry\u2019s key suppliers of clinical research services and equipment.\n\nThe new digs will help Thermo Fisher \u201cstrengthen\u201d its U.S. manufacturing capabilities for the broader pharma industry, the company stated.\n\nThe latest move is also a part of the four-year, $2 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing Thermo Fisher announced in April.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhen a bispecific antibody drug beat Keytruda in a Chinese lung cancer trial last year, excitement around the drug category skyrocketed, fueled by the tantalizing prospect of a newcomer unseating the megablockbuster.\n\nIvonescimab, which was developed by China-based Akeso and licensed to Summit Therapeutics, targets both PD-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that promotes blood vessel growth and shields tumors from the immune system. This dual-targeting approach \u2014 a hallmark of bispecific drugs \u2014 blocks immune evasion using PD-1 and cuts off the tumor\u2019s blood supply, which could pack a stronger cancer-fighting punch than either strategy alone.\n\nWhile the encouraging results in the Chinese phase 3 trial raised hopes ivonescimab and other drugs in the bispecific category could disrupt Keytruda\u2019s dominance in the oncology market, more recent data from a global trial of ivonescimab dampened that optimism. In the phase 3 study, the drug missed the key benchmark of overall survival. And even if future trials clear that hurdle, matching Keytruda\u2019s staggering success may still prove elusive, said Ethan Smith, therapy area director at Norstella.\n\n\u201cCan it become a $25 billion to $30 billion drug? I think that\u2019s a bit of a fantasy,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the candidate\u2019s other promising results have highlighted the rising potential of bispecifics to set new standards in cancer care.\n\nA rising drug class\n\nWhile Summit is leading the pack in bispecific antibody oncology contenders, ivonescimab isn\u2019t the only horse in the race. Among many contenders in the Big Pharma ranks vying for bispecific market share, companies like BioNTech, Merck & Co. and Pfizer boast several of the candidates in clinical development \u2014 a smattering compared to the overall space.\n\nBioNTech\u2019s BN327, acquired from Biotheus, differs from ivonescimab by targeting PD-L1 \u2014 instead of PD-1 \u2014 in addition to VEGF. It\u2019s in multiple phase 2 and phase 3 trials for lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, and has shown some favorable data. In June, the company announced it is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to test the drug in solid tumors as well.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging.\" Ethan Smith Therapy area director, Norstella\n\nKeytruda maker Merck is in early-phase testing with LM-299, which it licensed from LaNova Medicines. The company is looking to shore up its pipeline to compensate for an expected drop in Keytruda sales when a key patent expires in 2028 and the door opens to biosimilar competition.\n\nPfizer signed a $1.25 billion deal with 3SBio for SSG-707, another PD-1xVEGF that is poised to start phase 3 trials in China.\n\nSigns of promise and setbacks\n\nIn the meantime, the industry will be closely watching ivonescimab, the fate of which could become a bellwether for other bispecifics in development.\n\nMost recently, the drug demonstrated positive progression-free survival data in topline results from Summit\u2019s phase 3 global clinical trial released in May.\n\nThe results overall, however, were a mixed bag. Despite delaying tumor progression, the drug\u2019s 21% reduction in the risk of death was not considered statistically significant and \u201cdidn't translate to overall survival,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price dropped 20% on the news, contributing to a murky picture of the drug\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI think a physician would say this is clearly beneficial for patients. But it\u2019s not something that the FDA will approve unless the final data does become significant, which I think is an outside bet,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe FDA typically requires statistically significant survival data for full approval. Even so, Summit plans to submit an FDA filing, although the timing isn\u2019t clear.\n\nGoing forward, all eyes will be on ivonescimab\u2019s performance in the two upcoming trials, Smith said. Both studies pit the drug directly against Keytruda, not a placebo as in the original trial.\n\n\u201cThis will help answer the bigger question: Can it replace Keytruda?\u201d Smith said.\n\nFinal results from these trials won\u2019t be released until 2027 or 2028, although there will likely be some earlier signals from interim data. However, two factors make it unlikely that the bispecifics can ultimately best Keytruda outside of the clinic. First, the oncology market has become more segmented and personalized.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn addition, Summit is a relatively small company and may have difficulty pushing the drug to the dizzying heights experienced by Keytruda. Partnering with another company to gain additional resources could change the outlook, Smith said. And there\u2019s buzz that the company is trying to do just that with AstraZeneca, which has reportedly been in talks with Summit about a deal as high as $15 billion for the bispecific, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut ultimately, even though PD-1 VEGF drugs are likely to earn a place in the oncology market, they probably won\u2019t completely edge out Keytruda at its peak.\n\n\u201cIn indications that make sense, like small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, it can [become] a very strong alternative,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat would be easier to do in the U.S., but will be more challenging in Europe, where you've got cost-effectiveness challenges if you've got a marginal benefit with ivonescimab versus a [Keytruda] biosimilar.\u201d\n\nWhether bispecifics or another up-and-coming technology succeeds in the clinic, it\u2019s unlikely any new drug will achieve the same reach as Keytruda, Smith said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any oncology drug is going to be able to replicate what Keytruda has done,\u201d Smith said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhile the U.S. abruptly backs out of commitments to fund early research at the National Institutes of Health, fruits of prior funding are still contributing to the nation\u2019s leading role in lifting the science that eventually makes its way into biopharma\u2019s innovation machine.\n\nRecent studies showcase the advances being made at lab benches around the world by scientists who depend on grants and awards from the NIH. That research drives not only the advancement of health and well-being, but also the U.S. economy.\n\nHere are some studies from just the last couple of weeks \u2014 all funded in part by the NIH \u2014 that could advance the biopharma industry by enhancing valuable products already on the market from mRNA to obesity.\n\nA new way to mRNA\n\nThe mRNA revolution, many years in the making, revved up a few notches with the quick and unprecedented introduction of vaccines to combat the raging COVID-19 pandemic. Companies like Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna solidified a perch on the biopharma podium for that fleeting moment, raking in billions in profit.\n\nDespite the lofty goals and ongoing development programs since the pandemic, mRNA technology hasn\u2019t become the industry workhorse it once promised to be. From political backlash to clinical stumbles, progress has stalled as the world awaits the next big mRNA push.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are working diligently to improve the original formula that makes mRNA successful at introducing genetic material for an antibody response, whether that\u2019s prophylactic like a vaccine or therapeutic like a cancer treatment. And researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a chemistry hack that could take some of the pain out of the shots, potentially lowering the bar for uptake in an already wary population.\n\nThe lipid nanoparticles that house mRNA fragments have historically been designed by constructing one compound from two parts \u2014 \u201cmuch like two halves of a sandwich coming together,\u201d according to a recent UPenn article.\n\nThe team of engineers added a third component to create a more diverse set of lipid nanoparticles, and from there they found a chemical ring called a phenol group that reduced the number of extra molecules floating around after a shot, dampening the inflammation that causes achy arms and the next-day slog.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers showed in animal models that the immune response from the altered lipid nanoparticle recipe resulted in a five-fold improvement in immune response, according to a study published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The research was funded in part by the NIH.\n\n\u201cBy essentially changing the recipe for these lipids, we were able to make them work better with fewer side effects,\u201d said the paper\u2019s senior author, Michael Mitchell, an associate professor in bioengineering at UPenn. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\nMitchell and his research team \u2014 as well as study co-author and mRNA pioneer Drew Weissman \u2014 hope the new recipe for mRNA housing units can bring the technology into a new phase of readiness for biopharma innovation.\n\nA GLP-1 boost\n\nThe weight loss benefits of GLP-1 drugs have opened the floodgates to a new world of pharmaceutical innovation \u2014 and profit. Billions of dollars have poured into the industry over the last few years as companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk ramp up efforts to get their diabetes and weight loss medications to as many patients as possible.\n\nDetermining root causes of obesity by understanding genetic factors in young patients could help pinpoint who is at risk of gaining weight, allowing for earlier intervention.\n\nA new genetic test developed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and England\u2019s University of Bristol uses certain risk factors to create a polygenic risk score that could explain about 17% of a person\u2019s body mass variation. The new method is twice as effective as previous methods, according to the University of Bristol.\n\n\u201cObesity is a major public health issue, with many factors contributing to its development, including genetics, environment, lifestyle and behavior,\u201d said Kaitlin Wade, one of the authors of the paper and an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Bristol. \u201cThese factors likely vary across a person's life, and we believe that some of these originate in childhood.\u201d\n\nDrugmakers like Lilly and Novo might not reach more patients directly through a genetic test, but understanding the path to obesity could help them develop more effective treatments.\n\nAnd while the pharma giants seek new formulations for shots like Ozempic and Mounjaro to meet patients\u2019 needs, academic researchers are also on the case. A Stanford University materials scientist and bioengineer has developed a hydrogel that can potentially allow an injected GLP-1 to last longer in the body with the same effect. The hydrogel kept drug levels steady in rats for six weeks without breaking down. Normally, GLP-1s are taken daily or weekly.\n\nThe hydrogel has water-like properties and a jelly-like consistency, allowing it to flow through an injector needle like a liquid but then form into a \u201cblob\u201d in the body, releasing the drugs tirzepatide or semaglutide over time, said Stanford\u2019s Eric Appel, an author of the study, in a Science News article.\n\nAppel has licensed the technology after animal studies in hopes of bringing it to the clinic. While hydrogels have been used in drug delivery for this purpose over years, their potential application to GLP-1s could make the patient experience easier to maintain, especially as dropoffs have become more prevalent.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe promise of AI and machine learning-driven drug discovery has fueled excitement and investment in pharma for years.\n\nNow Bristol Myers Squibb is leveraging those technologies in an approach that not only conceptualizes and creates potential molecules, but validates and forecasts certain endpoints well before clinical trials.\n\nMike Ellis, SVP, head, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Discovery & Development Sciences Permission granted by Bristol Myers Squibb\n\n\u201cWe don't go into the lab and make things unless we have a good idea of what the forecast looks like,\u201d said Mike Ellis, senior vice president and head of Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Discovery & Development Sciences organization. \u201cWhat are we excited about? What do we think we can learn from this molecule? What may be the concerns that we need to clarify in the laboratory experimentally?\u201d\n\nEllis is spearheading BMS\u2019 AI efforts, which include developing and implementing proprietary AI/ML tools that can predict both success and potential stumbling blocks before molecules are synthesized, such as \u201csafety liability that could pop up later,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nAll of BMS\u2019 \u201cpredict first\u201d-enabled small molecule programs now use AI to evaluate properties like efficacy prior to synthesis, a significant leap from just 5% in 2021. BMS is applying a similar approach to nearly half of its large molecule experiments as well.\n\nOptimizing R&D has always been a priority but has become more pressing in the industry. Looming patent cliff losses are set to trigger billions in revenue losses for a number of pharma giants including BMS, which is losing exclusivity for moneymakers like Revlimid, Pomalyst and Sprycel in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe are enriching what we actually go and make and how we study it based on prediction.\u201d Mike Ellis SVP, head, Discovery & Development Sciences, BMS\n\nThose patent losses, along with increased R&D belt-tightening, are prompting companies to use AI to speed and de-risk the clinical development process. Pfizer just expanded its deal with AI firm XtalPi to develop accurate predictive tools for small molecules. Meanwhile, Amgen CEO Bob Bradway recently noted that the company is leveraging AI and machine learning \u201cto choose the right molecules more quickly and bypass the empirical trial and error process.\u201d\n\nChemistry meets computation\n\nEllis served as executive director of chemistry for Celgene until BMS acquired the company in 2019. Before that, he was part of the medicinal chemistry team at Merck & Co. A chemist by training, he\u2019s always \u201cdabbled\u201d with computational tools, including in his graduate work and post-doctoral fellowship, he said.\n\n\u201cFrom the first time I joined a medicinal chemistry team within the pharmaceutical industry, we were sitting around a table talking about programs with computational scientists in the room, bringing their perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt spoke to the shift in mindset for the lab experimentalist, and was reflective of some of the ways we changed even our team composition \u2026 [to] increase our number of computational scientists within the team [and] the ratio of computational scientists to lab experimentalists.\u201d\n\nNow, he believes the industry \u2014 and BMS \u2014 is at \u201can inflection point\u201d for the power of those tools.\n\n\u2018Choose your own adventure\u2019\n\nThere are always going to be multiple solutions to the same problem, and likewise, \u201cmultiple molecules that one could get to that could be safe and effective,\u201d Ellis said. The predict-first model allows BMS to increase the probability of advancing the most promising molecules by using AI to guide early decisions before committing resources to lab testing.\n\nWhile this approach is still like searching for a \u201cneedle in a haystack,\u201d it makes the pile of hay a bit smaller by moving away from a funnel-based screening approach and moving toward a \u201cchoose your own adventure,\u201d he said, allowing scientists to more precisely prioritize what molecules to make and how to test them based on AI-guided predictions.\n\n\u201cWe are enriching what we actually go and make and how we study it based on prediction,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSo rather than potentially redundant or incremental differences between molecules, we're trying to strategically approach what we go in the lab and make [and] what data we generate on those molecules so that it can inform the next cycle as effectively as possible.\u201d\n\nAmong the predict-first programs in the company\u2019s pipeline is an effort to find CELMoD agents for sickle cell disease.\n\nBMS is already studying CELMoD agents that target protein degradation to treat multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the company presented positive data for those programs in June.\n\nAlthough BMS knew it wanted to target protein degradation for sickle cell disease, Ellis said the company hit a \u201cplateau\u201d as it worked toward identifying a clinical candidate.\n\n\u201cWe have many parameters that we\u2019re going after in parallel. And often \u2026 you pull on one thread of those parameters and the other one breaks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can kind of get to all the pieces that you want in a molecule, except it\u2019s spread across five different molecules \u2026 How do we marry things all together?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the company \u201cstarted to bring more computational scientists, as well as models and tools\u201d into the program. Within weeks, they\u2019d crossed the months-long plateau.\n\n\u201cAs we started to apply prediction across what we saw as the most important parameters in a composite, computationally we started to move in directions that were different than where we had been before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to quickly get us into a better space where ultimately we were able to build each of those parameters into a single molecule as the ultimate goal.\u201d\n\nEllis called BMS\u2019 commitment to computational tools a \u201ccultural evolution\u201d in everything from determining which molecules move into the lab and how the company structures its teams, to embracing \u201chybrid intelligence\u201d that marries human and computational skills for \u201cenriching the quality of ideas and accelerating the decision making on programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we've appreciated and been proud of is the cultural progression and adoption that we've seen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's going to be increasingly embedded in what we do.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "Reddit has published its latest performance report, showing steady increases in ad revenue and usage in Q2 2025, as it continues to refine and improve its business elements.\n\nThough its user growth did slow a little in the last three months, and its costs are rising.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the latest data from the Reddit team.\n\nFirst off, on users. Reddit rose to 110.4 million daily active users in Q2, a slight increase on its Q1 numbers.\n\nAs you can see in this chart, Reddit\u2019s international growth slowed significantly in Q2, while its U.S. usage remains fairly stagnant. That could suggest that Reddit\u2019s popularity is beginning to plateau, and the fact that it\u2019s losing momentum in international markets could be a concern.\n\nStill, Reddit says that it remains confident in its growth opportunities.\n\nAs per Reddit:\n\n\u201cWe see tremendous potential to grow our user base and deepen engagement, and we\u2019re moving quickly to align priorities and resources to capture that opportunity. As a first step, we clarified our product strategy and are investing in making Reddit a better experience for everyone who comes to the platform - whether they\u2019re scrolling their favorite subreddit, seeking input on a purchase, or discovering a new community for the first time.\u201d\n\nReddit says that its improving machine translation tools could help it gain more traction in more markets, while it\u2019s also becoming a more valuable tool for shopping discovery, with users coming to the platform to get real, human insights into products, as opposed to generic, AI-generated summaries.\n\nIndeed, Reddit says that 40% of Reddit posts are \u201ccommercial in nature.\u201d And with 80% of Reddit users noting that some questions can only be answered by humans, as opposed to AI-generated summaries, there is a significant crossover of information and opportunity within subreddit groups.\n\nThough Reddit does also have its own AI answers, via \u201cReddit Answers,\u201d which uses info sourced from relevant subreddits to provide overviews of user notes.\n\nReddit says that Reddit Answers has grown to 6 million weekly queries, while 70 million users are conducting weekly searches in the app.\n\nA coming expansion of Reddit Answers to all users will enable the platform to capitalize on this, and build a more dedicated AI product built entirely on Reddit\u2019s corpus of responses.\n\nSo while Reddit is in some ways eschewing more generalized AI answers, it\u2019s also looking to tap into the power of AI to maximize its own community insights, though given the value of subreddit reviews and informational notes, these could be a more valuable, more insightful approach to such.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Reddit brought in $500 million for the quarter, a significant increase from Q1.\n\nThe numbers reflect the platform\u2019s increasing focus on monetization, and building its business elements. Which Reddit hadn\u2019t made a significant focus in the past, but now, it\u2019s looking to tap into all the opportunities that it can to increase its revenue intake.\n\nOn that front, Reddit says that some of its newer ad offerings, like Conversations Summary Add-Ons, have been gaining traction.\n\nIt\u2019s another way for Reddit to make use of its conversations to tap into user interest, though it is also worth noting that Reddit\u2019s increasing investment in AI is also driving up its costs.\n\nThat\u2019ll be an element to watch in the coming months, as Reddit looks to deploy smarter ad options and tools via AI, while also maximizing its margins and building profit.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good report card for Reddit, though the slowing user growth could be a concern. The fact that Reddit\u2019s making more money out of its userbase is a positive sign, but if that growth does slow, that will also impact its future ad prospects.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDr. George Tidmarsh doesn\u2019t have an established track record in government service. But his history as a physician, academic, biotech entrepreneur and importantly, his blossoming ties to the FDA\u2019s new band of leadership, were enough to land him a top post at the agency.\n\nThe FDA announced this week that Tidmarsh will be the new director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the agency\u2019s main drug review division. The high-profile and multi-faceted post can lend itself to controversial decision-making.\n\n\u201cOn any given day [CDER directors are] balancing the workflows of dozens of INDs, NDAs and ANDAs, driving policy for things like real-world evidence and adaptive trials, and then turning around to co-chair international harmonization meetings,\u201d said Aman Khera, president of TOPRA, The Organization for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs, in an email. \u201cThe role is part scientist, part CEO, part diplomat.\u201d\n\n\"There\u2019s a real thirst for forward-looking guidance on cutting-edge modalities and a willingness from CDER.\" Aman Khera President, TOPRA, The Organization for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs\n\nTidmarsh replaces Dr. Jennifer Corrigan-Curay, who took over as acting director after Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni vacated the post along with several other FDA leaders just before President Donald Trump took office this year. Tidmarsh is coming into the agency as it grapples with job cuts that initially stranded 3,500 staffers before some employees were asked to return. At the same time, the FDA is pushing to modernize its review process through AI and other new policies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s relentless pressure to maintain review speed under flat or shrinking budgets, without cutting corners on safety,\u201d Khera said.\n\nWhile Tidmarsh\u2019s biotech background has triggered age-old concerns over the \u201crevolving door\u201d between the FDA and pharma, \u201cphysician-scientists or seasoned life-sciences executives\u201d are typically tapped to helm CDER, Khera said.\n\n\u201cThat bench-to-bedside trajectory, plus proven operational skills managing large, multidisciplinary teams, ensure they can translate cutting-edge science into efficient regulatory pathways,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring a transition for the agency that\u2019s triggered uncertainty for pharma, the industry is now craving predictability.\n\n\u201c[Pharma companies] want clear, consistent review timelines and transparent review criteria so they can plan development programs with confidence,\u201d Khera explained. \u201cBeyond that, there\u2019s a real thirst for forward-looking guidance on cutting-edge modalities and a willingness from CDER to pilot new regulatory-science approaches.\u201d\n\nHow effectively will Tidmarsh deliver on those expectations? A look at his career and past public comments offers clues.\n\nHis past in academia\n\nTidmarsh has long been associated with Stanford University, where he studied cancer biology and now serves as adjunct faculty of pediatrics and neonatology. Both FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary and NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya hailed from Stanford as well, and in a wide-ranging conversation with Makary on Monday, Tidmarsh called the university his \u201chome\u201d since he arrived there as an undergraduate in 1979.\n\nTidmarsh teaches clinical research and development, according to Stanford\u2019s faculty bio, but \u201c[h]e focuses most of his efforts currently on improving scientific data integrity in published literature.\u201d\n\nTidmarsh\u2019s connection to published literature has been controversial. He contributed to the Journal of the Academy of Public Health founded this year by Bhattacharya \u2014 which Bloomberg called a \u201cfringe medical journal\u201d connected with a conservative nonprofit and several other appointees to top government positions. The journal has been quiet since May.\n\nHis biotech pursuits\n\nTidmarsh is also known as a serial entrepreneur in biopharma. His first known founding effort was Threshold Pharmaceuticals, where he served as CEO from 2001 to 2006, according to LinkedIn, and which merged with Molecular Templates in 2017.\n\nTidmarsh was the founder of Horizon Therapeutics in 2005, serving as CEO until 2008. His tenure there was defined by an approval for a rheumatoid arthritis drug Duexis that was later subject to pricing controversies. Horizon, which focused on rare diseases after Tidmarsh\u2019s departure, was sold to Amgen for $28 billion in 2022.\n\nHe was also CEO of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company from 2011 to 2019, leading the development of a blood pressure drug that failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nTidmarsh is credited with bringing seven drugs to the market.\n\nHis latest role was at Revelation Biosciences\u2019 board of directors, which he stepped down from in May, informing fellow members that he \u201cwill be working closely with U.S. governmental agencies\u201d as a Stanford faculty member that could pose a conflict of interest.\n\nTidmarsh said his appointment to CDER came out of \u201cproximity\u201d to Makary and Bhattacharya, particularly during a dinner the three men shared in Washington, D.C., when Bhattacharya was nominated for the NIH role.\n\nPublic health critiques\n\nLike many of the FDA\u2019s new leaders, Tidmarsh has openly criticized public health policy, particularly the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19.\n\nDuring an interview on a podcast called \u201cDerate the Hate\u201d last year, Tidmarsh lambasted the lack of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d in public health during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cTypically, in academia there is a good debate that occurs over time to at least attempt to come to the right answer. That got short-cut in the pandemic,\u201d Tidmarsh told host Wilk Wilkinson, who pegged himself as a \u201cstaunch conservative\u201d during the episode. \u201cNot only did it not happen, but it turned into political polarization.\u201d\n\nTidmarsh also hinted at his support for the theory that the novel coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, a belief that has permeated right-leaning circles for years, and suggested that the NIH\u2019s \u201cguilt\u201d over its role in the pandemic could have contributed to its policy-making approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I have any evidence other than what\u2019s there publicly, but I can say that there clearly was some link between the NIH and the research that was done in Wuhan,\u201d Tidmarsh said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re worried you contributed to something that\u2019s going to be horrible \u2026 you don\u2019t want a lot of debate.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Tidmarsh was sympathetic to government leaders, noting that regardless of what decisions were made, he understood why agencies had to stick to their guns.\n\n\u201cOnce they decided on those rules, you can\u2019t fault them for being draconian about enforcing those,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a principle within public health and infectious diseases \u2026 because if you let it leak a little bit, it goes everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut an op-ed Tidmarsh penned this year also heaped criticisms onto former CBER director, Dr. Peter Marks, for his handling of approvals that included COVID vaccines, Biogen and Eisai\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment Aduhelm and Sarepta Therapeutics\u2019 gene therapy Elevidys, which was just pulled from the market this week following several patient deaths.\n\nHow he\u2019ll lead at FDA\n\nDespite his industry and academic bona fides, Tidmarsh has some leadership skills to learn, he admitted to Makary this week.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing I need to work on is motivating people,\u201d he said. \u201cI started companies, but I usually turned it over to someone else when it got to a certain size. La Jolla was probably the largest at about 600 people. Maybe the principles are the same, but \u2026 I have to be comfortable in that larger role.\u201d\n\nDuring his sit-down with Makary, Tidmarsh praised the FDA and its staff, and echoed the commissioner\u2019s mission to \u201cmodernize\u201d the agency, noting that reform efforts are not a criticism of past performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful agency,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience has been incredibly positive from the sponsor side, but I\u2019ve also seen growth and improvement, and I think there\u2019s more to grow and improve.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Tidmarsh said he wants to boost efficiency in reviews and establish more consistency in communication to sponsors working in the \u201csame disease state.\u201d\n\nThat consistency in how the FDA handles reviews, especially as it integrates new technologies, is one of the chief issues facing the agency, Khera said.\n\n\u201cIntegrating AI and real-world data into decision-making looks promising but risks inconsistent application across review divisions,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while the conversation with Makary didn\u2019t touch on lingering challenges related to public trust in health agencies, Tidmarsh indicated in his interview with Wilkinson that politics should be removed from public policy decisions.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to a neutrality where these institutions are very revered, they are depended upon by all of us, they do good, but they are apolitical,\u201d he said.",

They just might need an extra nudge in that direction, and this new option could provide an easier way to do that.\n\nThough as noted, it does seem like a slight risk for TikTok, in terms of tracking user behavior. Various reports have suggested that TikTok tracks more user actions than other apps, while some people are still convinced that TikTok is overstepping its limits in the data that it collects from user devices.\n\nEnabling ad targeting based on this could be a point of contention for some users, but it is fairly innocuous, and only uses basic info for retargeting.\n\nIf it becomes broadly available, Engaged Session would be made available under TikTok\u2019s \u201cTraffic\u201d objective, while all TikTok ad placements will be able to use it.\n\nAs noted, TikTok is currently testing the option, with no plan as yet for a broader launch.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** TikTok Tests New Ad Tracking Option Amid User Privacy Concerns\n\n**Key details:**\nTikTok is testing a new ad targeting option called \"Engaged Session\" designed to help brands measure off-app activity without tracking pixels. This feature allows advertisers to target users who spend at least 10 seconds on a website or landing page after clicking an ad. The aim is to provide insights into engagement metrics like Total Engaged Sessions and Cost per Engaged Session. TikTok has stated that this option is not currently live in TikTok Ads Manager and has not been communicated to ad partners. The company confirmed it regularly experiments with features, some of which do not become final products.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis new tool offers advertisers more data to understand how TikTok promotions lead to product engagement and purchases. It aims to align closely with third-party analytics, potentially enhancing the measurable impact of TikTok ad campaigns. However, the initiative carries a notable risk for TikTok given past controversies surrounding its user tracking and data collection practices. While described as \"fairly innocuous\" in its use of basic info for retargeting, enabling such targeting could still become a point of contention for some users, potentially challenging perceptions of TikTok's data privacy commitments. For investors, this could signal TikTok's push to enhance ad platform value versus the ongoing risks of user backlash over data.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTikTok regularly experiments with new features and tests to gather user feedback. The company has previously faced scrutiny and controversies regarding its methods of tracking users' activity without explicit permission. Various reports have indicated that TikTok tracks more user actions compared to other applications. Some individuals remain convinced that TikTok oversteps its boundaries in the data it collects from user devices. The \"Engaged Session\" aims to identify and retarget \"high-intent users\" who have shown interest in products by clicking through to a website, making them more likely to purchase.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   10 seconds: Minimum duration a user must spend on a website/landing page after clicking an ad to be considered an \"Engaged Session.\"\n*   Not mentioned in the article: Specific number of selected partners currently testing this feature.\n*   Not mentioned in the article: Projected increase in advertiser ROI from this feature.\n*   Not mentioned in the article: Total number of active TikTok advertisers.\n*   Not mentioned in the article: The financial investment in developing this new tracking option.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   TikTok: Is testing a new ad targeting option called \"Engaged Session\" for advertisers.\n*   SMT: Was informed by TikTok that the \"Engaged Session\" option is not yet live.\n*   AdWeek: Reported that TikTok has been working with selected partners on the \"Engaged Session\" option.\n*   Google: Its analytics metrics align closely with the proposed \"Engaged Session\" metrics.\n*   Adobe Analytics: Its analytics metrics align closely with the proposed \"Engaged Session\" metrics.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for any future announcements regarding a broader launch plan for the \"Engaged Session\" option.\n*   Observe if TikTok decides to make the \"Engaged Session\" option broadly available under its \"Traffic\" objective.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTikTok tests new ad tool, balancing advertiser needs with user privacy concerns.",

        "summary_text": "Yeah, this is not going to go down well with smaller creators on Instagram.\n\nOver the past few weeks, you may have seen this notification pop-up in your IG feed (via Social Varsity):\n\nYes, Instagram has increased its follower requirements for live-streaming, which will mean that users who haven\u2019t grown their account to a certain level will no longer be able to broadcast in the app.\n\nWhich will be a significant blow to many smaller creators who use IG Live for varying purpose, and have been able to connect to smaller groups via live-streams. Now, you\u2019ll have to do video calls instead. Which, if you only have 1,000 followers, will probably work anyway, but that\u2019ll also reduce any discoverability benefits that come from live-streaming on IG.\n\nSo why the change?\n\nI asked Meta about the update, and it told me\u2026 nothing.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t get back to me with an explanation on the update, so I can only speculate on the possible reasons.\n\nFor one, live-streaming is expensive to support, and maybe Meta decided that it\u2019s not worth paying to fund live-streams with only eight viewers. People can also use live-streams for less than savory purpose, by creating a new account, referring people to it, then broadcasting NSFW material. If it gets banned, so be it, and maybe, by increasing the threshold to 1,000 followers, that\u2019ll eliminate those who may be looking to use its tools for this purpose.\n\nIt could also help to increase the quality of live-streams, by ensuring that only people with some sort of audience can broadcast. Like, you\u2019re less likely to be a full kook if you have at least a thousand people following you, and maybe, that could then increase the overall perception of streaming as a medium.\n\nThe change also brings IG more into line with the live-streaming requirements of other platforms. On TikTok, users also need to have 1,000 followers to be able to live-stream, while YouTubers need at least 50 subscribers, which, considering the viewer-to-subscriber ratio, is probably about the same thing.\n\nYouTube also recently increased the age limit of live-streaming in the app to 16, the same age restriction that IG implemented back in April.\n\nSo there\u2019s been broader action on live-streaming in general, for seemingly various reasons, and this is just another update along the same lines.\n\nWhich, again, is bad news for smaller creators, but maybe you\u2019ll just have to put more time into building an audience before you broadcast.",

The update is a significant blow to many smaller creators who use IG Live for connecting with groups. These creators will now need to use video calls instead, which reduces potential discoverability benefits.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis update significantly impacts smaller creators, potentially challenging the previous expectation of broad accessibility for all users on the platform. While it might reduce discoverability for some, the change may increase the overall quality of live-streams. The move also aligns Instagram's live-streaming requirements with those of other major platforms like TikTok. For investors, this signals a potential shift towards quality control and possibly cost efficiency over maximizing creator numbers in this specific feature.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMeta, Instagram's parent company, did not provide an official explanation for the update, leading to speculation. Possible reasons include the high cost of supporting live-streams, especially those with very few viewers. Another theory is to curb the use of live-streams for \"less than savory purposes\" or NSFW material by raising the entry threshold.

        "date": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:43:35 -0400",
        "summary_text": "TikTok has launched an alternative version of app in Europe which seemingly aims to to put more focus on the positive, beneficial aspects of the TikTok experience via the incorporation of a new initiative that makes it easier to support charity organizations in the app,\n\nTikTok\u2019s new app is called \u201cTikTok Pro,\u201d and is now available for download in Germany, Portugal and Spain, with more regions to follow. TikTok says that the alternate version of the app will allow \u201cpeople to experience and engage with joyful and entertaining content.\u201d\n\nWhich implies that this is different to the main TikTok app, because of the focus on positive, educational content.\n\nAs per the TikTok Pro description on the German App Store:\n\n\u201cTikTok Pro is a global video community where you can discover the coolest, funniest, and most educational short videos and share special moments with your friends. A useful app with a whole world within itself. TikTok Pro gives you the best video experience with helpful videos, engaging STEM content, and more personal expression.\u201d\n\nSo it sounds like a custom, more positivity-focused TikTok experience, though TikTok has informed me that this is not the case.\n\nTikTok says that the content in TikTok Pro is exactly the same as the videos that are displayed in the main app.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference?\n\nWell, TikTok Pro is solely focused on the content, with no live-streams, no shopping, and no ads.\n\nYes, no ads. TikTok says that the idea is to encourage non TikTok users to try out the app, with all of these other elements removed to simplify the experience.\n\nThe other key difference is that TikTok Pro also comes with TikTok\u2019s new \u201cSunshine\u201d program built in, which \u201coffers a unique way for charities and NGOs to engage with new audiences, and allows the TikTok Pro community to support them.\u201d\n\nAs per TikTok:\n\n\u201cUsers can accumulate 'virtual Sunshine' by referring others to join and by engaging with content from charities, such as liking or reposting charity videos, following charity-related accounts and performing charity-related searches. People can then use that virtual Sunshine on a charity in the programme, and TikTok will make a donation to that charity.\u201d\n\nSo again, it\u2019s regular TikTok, but a simplified version, with charity donation processes built into the app direct. So it\u2019s less about getting you to buy stuff, and more about getting you to help others, with the whole principle of the new app being focused on facilitating a simplified experience.\n\nSo why does TikTok need another app to do this?\n\nI asked exactly this, and TikTok explained that it's about showcasing the app\u2019s content to more people, without some of the regular elements. TikTok says that this isn\u2019t about re-focusing on more positive elements, as such, but the removal of ads and shopping, as well as live-streaming, does seem to suggest that these could be elements that don\u2019t appeal to some audiences, for whatever reason.\n\nIt could also be an attempt to better align with local market regulators and rules, with TikTok still under scrutiny in many regions.\n\nIndeed, German politicians have repeatedly raised questions about the app, with some suggesting that TikTok should be banned due to the danger it poses to democracy, as \u201can instrument\" in China and Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare.\u201d\n\nThe EU Commission has also raised questions about TikTok\u2019s influence on younger users in particular, after recent controversy around the rise of the #SkinnyTok hashtag, which encouraged potentially harmful behaviors. EU regulators are also still exploring TikTok\u2019s algorithmic approach with respect to the EU Digital Services Act, and it could be that this new TikTok Pro app aligns with broader efforts by TikTok to address related concerns.\n\nAnd while TikTok says that this is not intended to provide a more positive user experience, as such, that is an interesting consideration in the context of how the local Chinese version of TikTok operates, with the Chinese Government overseeing content trends, and ensuring that more beneficial elements are promoted to Chinese youth.\n\nMy initial view was that this could be an experiment on that front, though I doubt that many non-Communist countries will be overly welcoming of such controls.\n\nTikTok says that this isn\u2019t the case either way, with the streamlined version of the app designed only to better highlight TikTok\u2019s main content feed. I mean, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d need another app for that, especially at the risk of cannibalizing your main app, but that\u2019s what TikTok tells me is the aim.\n\nTikTok says that it\u2019s partnering with a number of global and local charities on its Sunshine program, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res / Doctors Without Borders (MSF), WaterAid, Aktion Deutschland Hilft and the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU). It\u2019s also looking to add more charity partners over time.\n\nIt seems like an interesting concept, though it\u2019ll probably be a hard sell getting people to switch over to an alternate, less functional version of the app.\n\nBut then again, that\u2019s not the aim, it's focused on expanding TikTok\u2019s reach with non-users, though having them in an alternative app doesn\u2019t really make much sense as a growth strategy.\n\nMaybe, eventually, TikTok will be able to pitch this alternative version as an option for younger users, or TikTok could look to push it in other ways.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s an interesting development amid ongoing concerns about social media regulation and restriction.",

As a result, many gaming creators, in particular, found themselves at risk of violating the rules, because the games that they\u2019re streaming sometimes feature violence, while creators also expressed frustration at how the new rules around profanity would limit monetization in all videos that featured bad language within the first 15 seconds.\n\nYouTube sought to address the concerns about profanity in 2023, by reducing its restriction on ads to only videos that included strong profanity within the first 7 seconds. Which was better, though many creators have still been frustrated by how the policy is applied.\n\nSo now, YouTube will let you maintain full monetization for clips, even if they do include bad language in the first seven seconds.\n\nAs explained by YouTube\u2019s head of monetization policy Connor Kavanagh:\n\n\u201cToday we're updating our Advertiser Friendly Guidelines for content with strong profanity in the first seven seconds. These uploads will now be eligible to earn full ad revenue [\u2026] Previously, uploads with strong profanity in the first seven seconds would not be eligible for monetization, and would have gotten the yellow dollar icon.\u201d\n\nFor those unaware, YouTube\u2019s basic monetization levels are:\n\nThere are further qualifiers within each segment, but these are the basic three levels of content monetization.\n\nSo, yellow monetization means some restriction, and YouTube\u2019s now removing this for videos that include swear words in those initial seconds.\n\nWhy do the first seconds of a video matter so much?\n\n\u201cAdvertisers expect ads on YouTube to have distance between profanity and the ad that just served. Those expectations have changed, and advertisers already have the ability to target content to their desired level of profanity.\u201d\n\nSo the early playback restriction relates to ad proximity, but YouTube is now confident that it can maintain monetization for clips that include such, based on the expanded placement controls that advertisers have.\n\nThough there are still some provisos around bad language in your videos:\n\n\u201cWhile you can now use these words in the first seven seconds without impacting monetization status, it's important to note that monetization will remain limited if you use moderate or strong profanity in titles or thumbnails. Additionally, [videos that include] strong profanity with high frequency will still face restrictions.\u201d\n\nIn summary, bad language in your videos will now have less impact on your monetization potential, but a lot of bad language will still lead to restrictions.\n\nSeems pretty straightforward, but you can refer to YouTube\u2019s updated Advertiser Friendly Guidelines for more insight.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** YouTube Loosens Profanity Rules, Boosting Creator Monetization Potential\n\n**Key details:** YouTube has updated its Advertiser Friendly Guidelines, allowing full monetization for videos with strong profanity in the first seven seconds. This policy reverses a 2023 change where such content received restricted \"yellow dollar icon\" monetization. The update means creators can now earn full ad revenue despite early bad language. According to YouTube\u2019s head of monetization policy, Connor Kavanagh, uploads with strong profanity in the initial seven seconds will now be eligible for full ad revenue.\n\n**Why it matters:** This policy reversal could prove popular among many creators who previously faced demonetization due to profanity rules. It signifies that early bad language in videos will now have less impact on overall monetization potential. YouTube states that advertisers' expectations regarding ad proximity to profanity have changed. This challenges the previous industry understanding that strict early profanity restrictions were non-negotiable for advertisers, as YouTube now believes it can maintain monetization through expanded placement controls.\n\n**The big picture:** In 2022, YouTube unveiled updated Advertiser Friendly Guidelines, introducing new rules around inappropriate language. This led to many gaming creators, in particular, facing demonetization due to profanity in the first 15 seconds. YouTube sought to address these concerns in 2023 by reducing restrictions to only strong profanity within the first seven seconds. This latest update is a continuation of YouTube's ongoing efforts to refine its monetization policies regarding language.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **First 7 seconds:** New window for strong profanity without monetization impact.\n*   **First 15 seconds:** Previous restriction window for bad language under 2022 guidelines.\n*   **2023:** Year YouTube previously reduced ad restrictions to only the first 7 seconds.\n*   **2022:** Year YouTube first unveiled an update to its Advertiser Friendly Guidelines.\n*   **3:** Number of basic content monetization levels available on YouTube.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **YouTube:** The platform that announced an update to its Advertiser Friendly Guidelines.\n*   **Connor Kavanagh:** YouTube\u2019s head of monetization policy, who explained the new guidelines.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Refer to YouTube\u2019s updated Advertiser Friendly Guidelines for more insight on the changes.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** YouTube's new profanity rules aim to boost creator monetization potential.",

        "summary_text": "LinkedIn has done it again.\n\nEvery quarter, LinkedIn\u2019s parent company Microsoft posts its performance update, which outlines all of its various tech projects and elements, and how they\u2019ve fared over the preceding three months.\n\nAnd every time, without fail, in literally every update on LinkedIn\u2019s performance since 2018 (except one), in virtually every report since it acquired the platform, Microsoft has reported the exact same thing:\n\n\u201cLinkedIn saw record levels of engagement.\u201d\n\nWhich seems impossible, right? Surely LinkedIn can\u2019t be seeing \u201crecord levels\u201d of engagement every single quarter. Right?\n\nWhat about the Christmas period, LinkedIn\u2019s seeing \u201crecord levels\u201d of engagement then, over and above regular interaction? I mean, sure, LinkedIn\u2019s always adding more users (or members at least), and that should lead to more interaction and engagement. But LinkedIn also lost 54 million users when it shut down its app in China back in 2021, which, you would assume, would have had some impact on this element.\n\nSurely it can\u2019t be setting a new record for engagement in the app every single quarter.\n\nRight?\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s see what Microsoft has reported in its latest earnings update?\n\nOh wow, what a surprise. LinkedIn saw a 9% increase in overall revenue, and 7% sessions growth, with \u201crecord engagement.\u201d\n\nCool cool, all makes sense, record levels. Sure.\n\nOf course, these are only surface-level stats, and we don\u2019t have enough to go on to make a real assessment of LinkedIn\u2019s actual activity levels. As such, we also don\u2019t know what \u201csessions growth\u201d actually relates to without a reference point, though in its accompanying earnings call, LinkedIn did also note that comments are up over 30%, and video uploads have increased by more than 20% this year.\n\nSo, more direct interactions, while video has become a much bigger consideration for LinkedIn users.\n\nLinkedIn also recently reported that videos are 20x more likely to be shared in the app, while video content also generates 1.4x more engagement than other post types.\n\nWorth considering in your approach.\n\nIn terms of overall growth, LinkedIn has also reported that it\u2019s now up to 1.2 billion members, rising from the billion that it reported in July last year.\n\nOf course, as always, it\u2019s worth noting that \u201cmembers\u201d and \u201cactive users\u201d are two different things, and on that front, LinkedIn\u2019s active usage is more likely around 400 million monthly users.\n\nBut it sounds good, I guess. \u201cRecord levels\u201d of engagement, \u201c1.2 billion members.\u201d It sounds better than \u201cslight increase in engagement\u201d and \u201c400 million MAU.\u201d And Microsoft isn\u2019t obligated to report anything further, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s doing anything wrong, it just seems a little unclear, and potentially misleading as to LinkedIn\u2019s actual performance.\n\nThat\u2019s also become a point of contention among LinkedIn users, who have reported seeing more and more examples of automated engagement, and engagement pod activity in the app.\n\nEngagement pods are coordinated groups of users that work together to comment, like and engage with each other\u2019s posts, in order to boost their reach via platform algorithms. And like other social apps, there\u2019s a range of platforms and offerings that provide LinkedIn pods as a service, and LinkedIn users have provided data to SMT which shows that artificial engagement activity like this is fairly common in the app.\n\nThe scale of such is relative. Thousands of posts that see artificial engagement activity, based on millions of active users, may not be as significant as it might seem to the individual user. But there are clearly a lot of artificial engagements happening in the app, which are getting harder to detect due to the adoption of AI tools to create such.\n\nCombine that with LinkedIn coaches who encourage users to comment and engage as much as they can in the app, in order to increase their visibility, which in itself could indirectly contribute to engagement pod activity, and this is a difficult challenge to police, though LinkedIn tells me that it is working to address it.\n\nI spoke to LinkedIn about the concerns with engagement pods and automated engagement, and its team is well aware of the concern, and is actively working to improve its detection and enforcement measures. LinkedIn says that it reduces the reach of such activity when detected, while it\u2019s also looking to educate creators on how, and why they should avoid such activity.\n\nIn addition, LinkedIn says that its actively taking action against engagement pods that violate its Terms of Service through behaviors like automation. And while some of this activity is difficult for LinkedIn itself to enforce, given that such programs are often coordinated off-platform, it is aware of the engagement pod services that it exist, which is another area it\u2019s exploring.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t provide in-depth insight into its plans on this front, but LinkedIn has been pursuing legal action against other services for different violations of its usage terms, and at least some of these engagement pod groups could soon be in its sights on this front as well.\n\nBut essentially, LinkedIn is aware of the concern. And while it may be frustrating for LinkedIn users who are seeking to build their presence the right way, and it may seem like LinkedIn isn\u2019t doing enough to address it (because, as some have suggested, LinkedIn benefits from the resulting engagement), LinkedIn is aware of the problem, and it is looking to address such misuse.\n\nMicrosoft has also made note of LinkedIn\u2019s evolving AI tools, with the platform looking to \u201cbring AI to every part of the LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales.\u201d\n\nAgents are part of LinkedIn\u2019s next big AI push, with AI bots that can undertake tasks on your behalf, while LinkedIn has also added a range of generative AI elements to the post and profile creation process.\n\nWhich probably also ties back into the broader concerns with artificial engagement in the app, and could be another factor clouding LinkedIn\u2019s enforcement of this element. But with Microsoft investing big into OpenAI, it\u2019s keen to add AI everywhere that it can, and as such, LinkedIn is inevitable also going to see an increase in AI generated interaction.\n\nOverall, however, LinkedIn\u2019s performance seems pretty solid, with more engagement, particularly with video content, though concerns to be addressed with fake interactions. But LinkedIn remains the key platform for professional connection, and amidst tougher economic conditions, it will continue to be an increasingly relevant and valuable tool for such.\n\nThanks to Elliot Grossbard for providing additional data for this story.",

Video content is 20x more likely to be shared and generates 1.4x more engagement than other post types.\n\n**Why it matters:** LinkedIn\u2019s consistent \"record engagement\" reports are questioned due to potential artificial activity from engagement pods and AI tools.

However, the company reported a 2.4% increase in revenue compared to Q1. Old Dominion's operating ratio in Q2 rose to 74.6%, up from 71.9% a year ago. Other less-than-truckload (LTL) peers, including ArcBest and TFI International, also experienced sequential revenue upticks in Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe sequential revenue improvement is a positive sign for Old Dominion amid the ongoing three-year downcycle in the LTL industry. Despite this uptick, the company's operating ratio worsened, as decreasing volumes can increase operating costs due to commitments to superior service. This information might challenge a consensus view of continued sequential declines in the LTL sector, suggesting a potential stabilization from Q1 lows. However, it also highlights persistent pressure on profitability due to higher operating ratios in the current weak demand environment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe LTL industry is grappling with a significant downturn, with volumes approximately 15% lower than their peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. This period is described as a \"three-year downcycle\" where companies are primarily focused on cost savings. Old Dominion maintains confidence in its business model's operating leverage and its long-term ability to improve its operating ratio. The company emphasizes a disciplined pricing strategy, avoiding revenue that does not align with its long-term goals.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Old Dominion Q2 revenue: $1.41 billion\n*   Old Dominion Q2 year-over-year revenue decline: ~6%\n*   Old Dominion Q2 operating ratio: 74.6%\n*   LTL industry volumes compared to pandemic peak: ~15% lower\n*   Old Dominion Q2 sequential revenue increase: 2.4%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Old Dominion Freight Line:** Reported Q2 revenue down yearly, but up sequentially, with an increased operating ratio.\n*   **Adam Satterfield:** Old Dominion EVP and CFO, noted sequential improvement helps combat the industry downcycle.\n*   **Kevin \u201cMarty\u201d Freeman:** Old Dominion President and CEO, expressed confidence in operating leverage despite a rising operating ratio.\n*   **ArcBest:** Experienced a similar sequential Q2 revenue uptick, but its year-over-year revenue declined.\n*   **TFI International:** Its LTL segment also recorded a sequential revenue increase during the second quarter.\n*   **Matt Beasley:** ArcBest CFO, secured 4% deferred increases in a market focused on shipper cost savings.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nOld Dominion sees sequential Q2 revenue rebound but struggles with industry downturn.",

If approved, this overhaul by Administrator Lee Zeldin could lead to the overturning of rules affecting truck and engine manufacturers. Industry advocacy groups, including the American Trucking Associations and Clean Freight Coalition, have applauded the proposed shift. Calstart, a nonprofit advocating for clean transportation technologies, opposes the proposal, stating it seeks to dismantle vehicle emissions standards.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis proposed policy overhaul represents a dramatic shift from current environmental regulations, drawing applause from industry groups. The Clean Freight Coalition states it would rescind the \"heavy-duty greenhouse gas phase three rule\" which they deemed unattainable. This directly challenges the previous consensus that such rules were necessary or achievable, as the industry believes they cause \"tremendous harm\" and \"higher prices.\" Conversely, Calstart warns the proposal would undermine U.S. EV and battery plant manufacturing investments, handing advantage to oil and foreign competitors, challenging the emerging consensus on clean transportation technology investment.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe original 2009 scientific finding identified electricity generation as the leading greenhouse gas emitter, followed by transportation. This finding served as a foundation for subsequent regulations, including tougher requirements for heavy-duty truck manufacturers unveiled last year.

It concluded that six greenhouse gases constitute a threat to public health, causing severe hurricanes, adverse air quality effects, and increased flooding risks.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   2009: Year of the EPA administrator's decision to be rescinded.\n*   Last year: When tougher heavy-duty truck requirements and the \"phase three rule\" were unveiled.\n*   2016 and 2022: Years of reaffirmations of the existing framework.\n*   July 29, 2025: Date Administrator Lee Zeldin announced policy overhaul in Indiana.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** The agency aiming to rescind a 2009 scientific finding that set emissions rulemaking for trucks.\n*   **Lee Zeldin:** Current EPA Administrator leading the proposed policy overhaul that could overturn truck rules.\n*   **American Trucking Associations (ATA):** An industry advocacy group that quickly applauded the EPA's proposed shift.\n*   **Chris Spear:** President and CEO of American Trucking Associations, who supported cleaner technologies with real-world policies.\n*   **Clean Freight Coalition (CFC):** Represents major trucking associations, voiced support for the EPA's proposed shift.\n*   **Jim Mullen:** Executive Director of the Clean Freight Coalition, stated the move would rescind the heavy-duty greenhouse gas phase three rule.\n*   **Calstart:** A nonprofit advocating for clean transportation technologies, which opposes the EPA's proposed dismantle of standards.\n*   **John Boesel:** President and CEO of Calstart, stated the proposal could undermine U.S. EV and battery plant manufacturing investments.\n*   **Lisa Jackson:** Former EPA Administrator during the Obama administration who set the existing framework for greenhouse gas findings.\n*   **Congressional Research Service:** Nonpartisan group that reported the policy change process could take months or years and require judicial review.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The EPA must make its case for changing the existing framework and accept public comments.\n*   The proposed move will require judicial review and may need defense against past reaffirmations.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nEPA's truck emissions rollback signals a major regulatory shift with industry and EV impacts.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Saia's New Terminals Show Strong Performance, Validating Expansion.\n\n**Key details:** Newer Saia terminals, opened within the last three years, have achieved an average operating ratio in the mid-90s. This marks an improvement from previous quarters where these newly added facilities were operating at breakeven thresholds. Shipments per workday for these new facilities increased 4% in Q2 versus Q1, outperforming legacy facilities which were up 2% sequentially. This indicates that Saia\u2019s customer-first focus is yielding tangible results, especially in new markets.\n\n**Why it matters:** The improved operating ratio in Saia's newer terminals suggests their significant investment in national network expansion is beginning to pay off. These results directly address previous concerns about the profitability of newly added facilities during their initial phases. The company's CEO emphasized that these positive outcomes reinforce their commitment to geographical expansion, enabling Saia to compete more evenly. This challenges a potential consensus view that heavy investment in network expansion during a negative freight market is slow to yield profitable returns.\n\n**The big picture:** Saia, an LTL carrier, invested heavily last year in expanding its network to achieve a national footprint. This expansion effort occurred despite the freight market experiencing negative conditions for three years. Saia currently operates 213 terminals, with recent focus on improving the performance of those opened within the last three years. Other LTL players are also expanding, significantly boosted by Yellow Corp.'s bankruptcy and the subsequent property sales and lease takeovers. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings has similarly expanded into LTL, gaining an edge in the West Coast market through M&A.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Newer Saia terminals' average operating ratio: mid-90s.\n*   Shipments per workday increase for new facilities (Q2 vs Q1): 4%.\n*   Shipments per workday increase for legacy facilities (Q2 vs Q1): 2%.\n*   Total number of Saia terminals: 213.\n*   Duration of negative freight market: three years.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Saia:** LTL carrier reporting improved financial and operational performance from its recently expanded network.\n*   **Frederick \u201cFritz\u201d Holzgrefe:** Saia\u2019s President and CEO, who commented on the tangible results and reinforced expansion commitment.\n*   **Yellow Corp.:** Bankrupt LTL player whose property sales and lease takeovers are aiding other carriers' network expansions.\n*   **Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings:** Truckload giant expanding into LTL, gained a West Coast market edge via M&A.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Saia's network expansion validates its strategy despite prolonged market headwinds.",

This card offers fuel discounts and rebates at over 8,000 BP gas stations, including Amoco and TravelCenters of America. Users can pay for various driving-related expenses such as parts, tolls, and roadside assistance, with companies able to set purchase controls. The card also features a chip for enhanced fraud protection. This initiative significantly expands BP\u2019s Earnify ecosystem, following the release of its Earnify loyalty program in October 2024.\n\n**Why it matters:** This new fleet card aims to attract fleet customers by unifying BP\u2019s fuel brands across an extensive network, making it easier for them to fuel and save. It simplifies payments for various driving-related expenses beyond fuel and enhances customer loyalty through the Earnify ecosystem. However, BP is simultaneously cutting 5% of its workforce this year, including the director who developed the Earnify loyalty program. This dual strategy of expanding customer programs while undergoing significant staff reductions, even impacting key program developers, could indicate a shifting strategic focus or internal reorganization that might challenge assumptions about BP's current operational priorities.\n\n**The big picture:** BP is actively building its Earnify ecosystem to consolidate and improve its customer loyalty and rewards programs. This effort began with the launch of the Earnify loyalty program in October 2024, which replaced several disparate rewards initiatives. The introduction of the Earnify fleet card represents a further expansion of this integrated system.

This moratorium applies to goods adhering to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) following a call between President Donald Trump and Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum. However, imports of cars, steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico will still face existing U.S. sectoral duties. Concurrently, Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports from India starting Friday, and 40% tariffs on imports from Brazil effective August 6. The two countries, U.S. and Mexico, will continue negotiations for three months to secure a long-term trade deal.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis news prevents the planned 30% tariff increase on Mexico, which was slated to begin Friday, offering a 90-day reprieve for certain Mexican imports. For investors, the extension on general tariffs for USMCA-compliant goods provides temporary stability in a key trade relationship. However, the continued application of sectoral duties on Mexican cars and metals signals persistent friction in specific industries. The immediate imposition of new tariffs on India and Brazil broadens the scope of U.S. trade actions, potentially challenging any consensus view that trade tensions were solely focused on specific major partners by indicating new fronts for duties.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Trump administration plans to resume country-specific duties this Friday after a monthslong pause. This decision regarding Mexico comes as the administration has reached various agreements and framework deals with other trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, prior to the return of these tariffs. Non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico have already been subject to a 25% tariff during the prior pause. The 90-day extension aims to allow for continued dialogue to establish a comprehensive, long-term trade agreement with Mexico.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   30%: Tariff imports from Mexico were slated to incur starting Friday.\n*   90 days: Extension period for the moratorium on tariffs for USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico.\n*   25%: Tariff on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico during the pause, and on imports from India starting Friday.\n*   40%: Tariff on imports from Brazil, effective Aug. 6.\n*   3 months: Period for continued negotiations between U.S. and Mexico to sign a trade deal.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S.:** Will extend a pause on tariffs for Mexico and impose new tariffs on India and Brazil.\n*   **Mexico:** Benefits from a 90-day tariff pause extension, pursuing a long-term trade agreement.\n*   **Donald Trump:** U.S. President, confirmed the tariff extension for Mexico and announced new tariffs on India and Brazil.\n*   **Claudia Sheinbaum:** Mexico's president, spoke with Trump and confirmed avoiding announced tariff increases.\n*   **European Union:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the Trump administration.\n*   **Japan:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the Trump administration.\n*   **South Korea:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the Trump administration.\n*   **India:** Will face 25% tariffs on imports from the U.S. starting Friday.\n*   **Brazil:** Will face 40% tariffs on imports from the U.S. effective August 6.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The U.S. and Mexico will continue to negotiate over the next three months with the goal of signing a trade deal.\n*   New 25% tariffs on imports from India take effect Friday, and 40% tariffs on imports from Brazil are effective August 6.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nU.S. delays Mexico tariffs but expands new duties to India and Brazil.",

The companies target a transaction close in 2027 and plan to submit a merger application to the Surface Transportation Board within the next six months. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena is slated to lead the combined company and has committed to remaining for at least five years.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe merger is pitched as a \"more truck-competitive solution\" that will decrease highway congestion, potentially challenging current freight transportation dynamics. The creation of a single coast-to-coast network aims to deliver faster, more competitive service by eliminating car touches and interchange delays. This could open new routes, expand intermodal services, and ensure faster transit times on key rail corridors, potentially disrupting existing freight logistics and market share between rail and trucking.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis agreement follows recent confirmations from both companies about being in \"advanced discussions\" regarding a potential merger. If approved, the combined network would connect over 50,000 route miles across 43 states. It would also provide access to 10 international interchanges and link with approximately 100 ports. The companies expect the combination to open new routes and reduce distance and transit times.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Transaction close target: 2027\n*   Merger application submission: next six months\n*   Combined network: 50,000+ route miles\n*   States connected: 43\n*   Ports linked: ~100\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Union Pacific:** One of the railroads agreeing to merge networks to form a transcontinental railroad.\n*   **Norfolk Southern:** The other railroad agreeing to merge, partnering with Union Pacific.\n*   **Surface Transportation Board:** The regulatory body that will review the merger application for approval.\n*   **Jim Vena:** Union Pacific CEO who would lead the combined company and committed to stay for five years.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Submission of the merger application to the Surface Transportation Board in the next six months.\n*   Target transaction close in 2027.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nMajor rail merger promises efficiency, challenges truck freight dominance.",

However, the company saw a 2.4% increase in revenue compared to Q1. Old Dominion's operating ratio in Q2 rose to 74.6%, up from 71.9% a year ago. Management stated that operating costs can increase when volume decreases due to their commitment to superior service.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe sequential revenue improvement, experienced by Old Dominion and other LTL peers, suggests a potential stabilization or slight upturn within the ongoing downcycle. This information might challenge a prevailing view that the industry is in a continuous, unmitigated decline, by highlighting positive sequential trends. However, Old Dominion's rising operating ratio indicates a challenge in maintaining efficiency as volumes remain soft. The company prioritizes service quality, even if it impacts short-term operating efficiency, which highlights a strategic trade-off.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe LTL industry is currently navigating a \"three-year downcycle,\" with overall volumes approximately 15% lower than during the COVID-19 pandemic surge. Old Dominion's EVP and CFO noted that sequential revenue improvement is helpful amidst this challenging period.

        "summary": "**Headline:** BP Expands Fleet Card Offerings Amidst Internal Staffing Reductions\n\n**Key details:**\nBP has partnered with commerce platform Wex to launch a new Earnify fleet card. This card offers fuel discounts and rebates at over 8,000 BP gas stations, including Amoco, TravelCenters of America, and Petro. The program also allows users to pay for parts, service, tolls, car washes, parking, and roadside assistance. Companies can set purchase controls, and the card features a chip for additional fraud protection.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis initiative aims to attract new fleet customers by consolidating various expenses under one card across BP\u2019s extensive network. For investors, this expansion of the Earnify ecosystem occurs concurrently with significant organizational changes within BP. The company is trimming 5% of its workforce, which notably included the departure of the Earnify loyalty program's developer. This dual strategy of growth and cost-cutting could challenge a pure expansion-focused consensus, suggesting a more complex strategic re-prioritization.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe new Earnify fleet card represents an expansion of BP\u2019s broader Earnify ecosystem, which was established with the release of its Earnify loyalty program in October 2024. This loyalty program was designed to replace a variety of disparate rewards programs across BP\u2019s many retail banners. Simultaneously, BP has been implementing workforce reductions, including the specific departure of Jack Benoff, the company\u2019s director of digital and loyalty for its U.S. convenience stores, who developed the Earnify loyalty program.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **8,000+**: BP\u2019s gas stations, including Amoco, TA, and Petro, where the Earnify fleet card is accepted.\n*   **2026**: Year Thorntons is expected to be added to the Earnify program.\n*   **October 2024**: Month and year BP released its initial Earnify loyalty program.\n*   **5%**: Percentage of BP's workforce planned for cuts this year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **BP**: Partnered with Wex on a new fleet card; expanding its Earnify ecosystem; trimming workforce.\n*   **Wex**: Commerce platform that partnered with BP on the new Earnify fleet card.\n*   **Amoco**: BP fuel brand included in the Earnify fleet card program.\n*   **TravelCenters of America (TA)**: BP fuel brand included in the Earnify fleet card program.\n*   **Petro**: BP fuel brand included in the Earnify fleet card program.\n*   **Thorntons**: Fuel brand expected to be added to the Earnify program in 2026.\n*   **Debi Boffa**: CEO of TravelCenters of Americas and BP\u2019s VP of fleet mobility; commented on new card.\n*   **Jack Benoff**: Former director of digital and loyalty for U.S. convenience stores; developed Earnify loyalty program.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Thorntons is expected to be added to the Earnify program in 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nBP launches new fleet card while simultaneously cutting workforce, signaling strategic shifts.",

This original finding identified electricity generation and transportation as the leading sectors of greenhouse gas emissions. Current EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin's proposed policy overhaul could lead to overturning rules affecting truck and engine manufacturers, including tougher heavy-duty truck requirements unveiled last year.\n\n**Why it matters:** This dramatic shift quickly drew applause from industry groups like the American Trucking Associations and Clean Freight Coalition, who opposed existing rules as \"unattainable targets.\" Conversely, clean transportation advocate Calstart warned the proposal could dismantle vehicle emissions standards. They argue it might undermine U.S. EV and battery plant manufacturing investments across several states, potentially handing an advantage to the oil industry and foreign competitors. This information challenges the consensus view favoring tighter emissions standards and a rapid transition to clean transportation technologies.\n\n**The big picture:** The existing framework, set by former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, found six greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare, citing impacts like severe hurricanes and health effects. The Trump administration had previously called these original regulations \"overreaching and costly.\" The EPA now states \"much has changed since the 2009 Endangerment Finding,\" citing new scientific and technological developments, and Supreme Court decisions emphasizing Congress's role in major policy determinations.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2009:** Year of the EPA administrator\u2019s decision that the agency is working to rescind.\n*   **July 29, 2025:** Date EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the major policy overhaul.\n*   **Six:** Number of greenhouse gases found to constitute a threat in the existing framework.\n*   **2016 and 2022:** Years in which the existing framework was reaffirmed.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Agency aiming to rescind a scientific finding that underpinned greenhouse gas emissions rules.\n*   **Lee Zeldin:** Current EPA Administrator announcing a major policy overhaul regarding emissions findings.\n*   **American Trucking Associations (ATA):** Industry advocacy group that quickly applauded the EPA's proposed policy shift.\n*   **Chris Spear:** President and CEO of American Trucking Associations, stated support for policies rooted in real-world conditions.\n*   **Clean Freight Coalition (CFC):** Represents major trucking associations and voiced support for the EPA's proposed shift.\n*   **Jim Mullen:** CFC Executive Director, said the move is a critical step towards rescinding a heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule.\n*   **Calstart:** Nonprofit advocating for clean transportation technologies, stated the proposal seeks to dismantle vehicle emissions standards.\n*   **John Boesel:** President and CEO of Calstart, warned the proposal could undermine U.S. EV and battery plant investments.\n*   **Lisa Jackson:** Former EPA Administrator during the Obama administration who set the existing endangerment finding framework.\n*   **Congressional Research Service:** Nonpartisan group that reported on the required next steps for the EPA's proposal.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The proposal requires the EPA to make its case in rulemaking and accept public comments, a process that could take months or years.\n*   The proposed move will require judicial review, and the agency may need to defend its proposal against prior reaffirmations of the existing framework.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** EPA's proposed rollback could reorient the future of US transportation and energy investment.",

This represents a significant improvement from previous quarters where these newly added terminals operated at breakeven thresholds. Shipments per workday at these new facilities increased 4% in Q2 versus Q1, outpacing the 2% sequential growth seen in legacy facilities. This performance is attributed to the carrier's customer-first focus, yielding tangible results in new markets.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis development challenges the potential consensus that Saia's heavy investment in network expansion was premature given the negative three-year freight market. The improved operating ratios and volume growth in new facilities suggest the expansion strategy is now yielding meaningful financial results.

This indicates successful operational integration and profitability from recent strategic investments.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSaia heavily invested last year in expanding its network to a national scale, despite a freight market that has been negative for three years.

For that quarter, the company revised its equipment values based on depreciation and impairment charges and said an adjusted operating loss of $6.6 million better reflected the company\u2019s performance.\n\nThe rough quarters come as PAMT\u2019s CEO resigned last month, citing family reasons, leaving company Chairman Matthew Moroun as interim president and CEO.\n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s logistics segment operating ratio was 97.7%, helping bring the company\u2019s overall operating ratio to 107.3%, according to the earnings report.

This marks the company's third straight quarterly operating loss. Its truckload operating ratio reached 112.5% for the quarter. Total miles and loads were down, though average owner-operator trucks increased compared to a year ago. The company's logistics segment, with a 97.7% operating ratio, helped mitigate the overall operating ratio to 107.3%.\n\n**Why it matters:** PAMT's Q2 results represent its worst quarter over the past year, marking a significant financial downturn. This comes as the company's CEO recently resigned, adding leadership instability during a challenging period. The persistent losses and high operating ratio for PAMT challenge any potential consensus view of stability or recovery in the truckload sector. This is further supported by other carriers reporting declining truckload revenues and worsening operating ratios, suggesting broader industry headwinds. Tariff-related uncertainty is also weighing on industrial end market demand, impacting truckload base stability.\n\n**The big picture:** PAMT has consistently experienced rough financial quarters, now reporting its third straight operating loss. The company's recent performance is occurring amid a broader industry trend where other major carriers are also reporting declining truckload revenues. For instance, Heartland Express posted significant operating and net losses in Q2. TFI International's truckload operating ratio worsened compared to a year ago, reflecting challenging conditions. Industry executives point to tariff-related uncertainty weighing on industrial end market demand, causing customers to delay activity.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   PAMT Q2 operating loss: $11.1 million\n*   PAMT Q2 net loss: $9.6 million\n*   PAMT Q2 truckload operating ratio: 112.5%\n*   Heartland Express Q2 operating loss: $12.4 million\n*   TFI International Q2 truckload operating ratio: 90.1% (worsened from 89%)\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **PAMT:** Parent company of P.A.M.

The company anticipates sales will jump 8.4% next year and 8.9% in 2027, according to an earnings presentation.\n\nIn part due to those new load expectations, AEP expects this fall it will increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30%, to about $70 billion, up from $54 billion, Fehrman said.\n\nAEP expects transmission investments will account for half the additional expenditures, followed by generation at 40% and the distribution system at 10%, according to Fehrman. Under the pending capital expenditure plan, AEP Texas could spend about $7 billion on transmission.\n\nChanges to federal clean energy tax credits signed into law July 4 don\u2019t appear to affect AEP\u2019s $9.9 billion plan to build wind and solar projects, according to Fehrman.\n\nA few renewable energy projects potentially could be affected by a July 7 executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to issue guidance on determining when a project may be deemed \u201cunder construction,\u201d a key issue for qualifying for tax credits, Fehrman said.\n\nIn November, AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, with an option to buy up to 1 GW in total by the end of this year, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are offering the fuel cells to data centers and other large customers as an immediate option for addressing their needs while grid infrastructure upgrades are being completed to accommodate their demand. Ohio Power, an AEP utility, has two contracts approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, totaling about 98 MW, for electricity service from fuel cells, according to the SEC report.\n\nOhio H.B. 15, which takes effect Aug. 14, repealed the statute that permits electric utilities to provide customer-sited renewable generation service such as fuel cells, but the law grandfathered the two PUCO-approved contracts, AEP said.\n\nTexas H.B. 5247, which became law in June, is \u201cincredibly constructive\u201d legislation for AEP Texas, according to Fehrman. The bill allows eligible utilities to use a \u201cunified tracker mechanism\u201d to recover their expenses, reducing regulatory lag, he said.\n\nThe cost-recovery mechanism could increase AEP Texas\u2019 return on equity by 0.5% to 1%, according to Mihalik. The utility has an 8.6% earned ROE, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is highly supportive of increasing our capital allocation to Texas as we participate in the massive infrastructure build-out needed to drive the economic growth in the state,\u201d Fehrman said.\n\nAEP\u2019s utilities have about 5.6 million customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.",

This committed load includes 13 GW in ERCOT and 9 GW in PJM, spanning various states. The company also reports inquiries for a massive 190 GW of potential new load. AEP's weather-normalized peak demand grew 12% to 37.6 GW in Q2, primarily driven by new industrial customers.\n\n**Why it matters:** The surging load expectations are driving a 30% increase in AEP's five-year capital spending plan to $70 billion. This significant investment, with half dedicated to transmission, indicates a strong commitment to infrastructure build-out. New Texas legislation (H.B. 5247) is expected to boost AEP Texas's return on equity by 0.5% to 1%. This could challenge the view that utilities face slow growth or significant regulatory lag in recovering large infrastructure investments, signaling a more favorable environment for AEP.\n\n**The big picture:** AEP's system, currently at 37 GW, is experiencing strong growth, with Q2 peak demand up 12% to 37.6 GW. This growth, driven by data centers and industrial customers, generated about $200 million in additional revenue. The company's extensive 765-kV transmission network is a key draw for new large-load customers. AEP anticipates accelerating weather-normalized retail electricity sales growth, reaching 8.9% in 2027.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **24 GW:** Expected new load by 2030, a 15% increase from previous estimate.\n*   **18 GW:** Portion of new load explicitly from data centers.\n*   **$70 billion:** New five-year capital spending plan, up 30% from $54 billion.\n*   **190 GW:** Total inquiries for possible new load on a 37 GW system.\n*   **0.5% to 1%:** Expected increase in AEP Texas's return on equity from new legislation.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **American Electric Power (AEP):** Utility company anticipating significant new load growth and increasing capital expenditures.\n*   **William Fehrman:** AEP President and CEO, provided new load expectations and capital spending plans.\n*   **Trevor Mihalik:** AEP CFO, reported on peak demand growth and potential return on equity increases.\n*   **Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT):** Market identified for 13 GW of AEP's new load, including crypto operations.\n*   **Bloom Energy:** Supplier of 100 MW of fuel cells to AEP, with options for further purchases.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   AEP expects to increase its five-year capital spending plan this fall.\n*   Ohio H.B. 15 takes effect August 14.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** AEP boosts investment to meet surging data center demand, aided by favorable legislation.",

        "summary_text": "Morgan Scott is vice president of global partnerships and outreach at the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nExtreme weather is here. Over the past month, the U.S. has experienced dangerous and deadly flash flooding and extreme heat. Projections for the 2025 wildfire season in the Western U.S. indicate significantly increased fire potential driven by drought expansion and above-average temperatures. Meanwhile, the 2025 U.S. tornado season is on track to be above the 30-year historical average, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season.\n\nBesides the devastating loss of life and the damage inflicted by these types of events, they have something else in common: they often leave communities without power to meet critical needs. Despite the inevitable occurrence of these events, there is good news for people in the paths of these natural disasters.\n\nThe power sector is not waiting around to reactively address damage from the next severe weather event. Hurricanes or extreme heat may be seasonal, but preparation is not.\n\nA coalition of more than 40 energy providers and system operators \u2014 along with 100 academics, policymakers, non-profits, government agencies and others \u2014 have worked together to develop a data-driven, science-based framework to improve the resilience and reliability of the power system.\n\nThe public Climate READi framework, issued and developed by independent, non-profit energy R&D institute EPRI, guides energy companies in assessing risk and vulnerability in the energy system across a wide variety of weather and climate conditions. In addition, utilities, regulators and other stakeholders can use this set of guidance, references and tools to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments and adapt the evolving electric system to the climate of the future.\n\nThe framework, developed over the past three years, highlights how factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience to climate hazards. Knowing the exposure of assets and systems to current and future climate hazards and pinpointing system vulnerabilities at the asset and company level is key for determining which adaptation strategies to consider for any region. It\u2019s important to note there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer, as a West Coast utility may need to prepare against wildfires versus an East Coast utility, which may more frequently deal with ice storms. Having different options for what best suits individual utilities will be key to proactive planning for these events.\n\nSo how do companies conduct climate-informed planning and analysis?\n\nFirst, the framework recommends having a dedicated team with clear ownership and responsibility. Once in place, the framework recommends the team begin with in-depth and iterative scoping, setting expectations among internal and external stakeholders to define the bounds and objectives of the assessment, while also integrating information from previous impacts of weather and climate events on asset or system performance. This involves the selection of climate data and vulnerability information that characterizes baseline conditions and captures the range of expected future conditions.\n\nSecond, the framework recommends conducting model-based evaluations across an integrated modeling platform, where data and assumptions are used consistently throughout. The company may also want to review its existing integrated resource plans, regulatory filings, or other planning documents to identify plausible future configurations of its portfolio.\n\nThird, it is important to ensure the load data used for planning and evaluation reflects the weather dependency for the selected conditions and technologies being evaluated.\n\nLastly, the framework recommends comparing baseline model results to results with the various adaptations in place to determine the anticipated benefits and cost effectiveness of options under consideration. This comparison can be used to justify and prioritize adaptation investments.\n\nWork has and will continue to be underway to proactively plan for the weather of the future. For example, last year, researchers from EPRI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory mapped how future hurricanes could affect power outage risk. Working with PNNL, we combined synthetic hurricane tracks in a future climate with a predictive power outage model, developed using power outage data from 23 historical hurricanes that affected the continental United States and Puerto Rico between 2016 and 2023. This allowed us to assess changes in outage risk in the 2066-2100 timeframe compared to today\u2019s climate. According to the models, the average person in the metropolitan areas of Houston, New Orleans and Boston could see expected outage events increase by more than 70% per decade, while Miami residents may see a 119% increase.\n\nAs this analysis shows, there isn\u2019t one clear answer, since different locations have different needs and weather conditions. Regardless of where you live, it\u2019s clear that a common, consistent and collaborative framework for physical climate risk \u2014 and available to all parties \u2014 is needed to ensure the reliable, resilient and affordable power system of the future for all of us.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAlthough investigations into the cause of the Eaton Fire remain incomplete, Southern California Edison will launch a Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program this fall to compensate victims of the fire, company executives said during a Thursday afternoon earnings call.\n\nThe fund will limit legal costs associated with the fire and help the community recover faster, executives said. They expect to recoup the cost of the program through California's Wildfire Fund, which reimburses utilities for claims stemming from wildfires.\n\nA spate of catastrophic wildfires in recent years, including this year's Eaton Fire, has prompted concern about the fund's stability. But Edison International President and CEO Pedro Pizarro told analysts he believes the state legislature will find a solution within the current legislative session.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAnalysts on Thursday's call questioned the \u201clogic\u201d of launching a compensation fund while the fate of the California Wildfire Fund remains an active debate at the state legislature. But Pizarro defended the move as the right thing to do for a community devastated by loss \u2014 and ultimately for the company as well.\n\n\u201cYou have a community that's been deeply impacted. It's just heart breaking to think about everything that's happened there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so to the extent that we have a probable loss and Edison is already dealing with lots of litigation already, etc, then I think it's a good idea to support the community by moving quickly.\u201d\n\nSouthern California Edison has already been sued by multiple parties, including the County of Los Angeles, for its alleged role in the fire. Investigations by the LA County Fire Department and SCE remain incomplete, but as yet have not identified possible ignition sources beyond the company's transmission lines, Pizarro said.\n\nThe total potential cost of the fire remains unknown, but a report issued last week by real estate firm Redfin suggested that the nearby Palisades Fire, which destroyed nearly 7,000 structures, could cost more than $50 billion. The Eaton Fire destroyed more than 9,000 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nPizarro told analysts on the call that the fund should have something like $22 billion available to reimburse SCE \u2014 and that he believed this should be sufficient to reimburse the company for claims related to the fire once its own $1 billion self-insurance fund is exhausted.\n\nHe said that the state would find a solution to shore up the fund and, in the long term, address the broader risk of wildfire. But he declined to comment on Wednesday's news that Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to propose an $18 billion expansion of the fund, with participating utilities paying for half the upfront cost. The other half would be paid via an ongoing charge on customers' electric bills.\n\nIn principal, Pizarro said, he opposes additional payments into the fund by utility shareholders. But, he said he had not yet seen the governor's proposal, and would need to consider the balance of everything it contained.\n\n\u201cWe don't foresee and frankly, don't see a need for having upfront contributions like there were in AB 1054 previously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process of going through claims can take quite a long time and so we don't anticipate that there would be a very rapid depletion of the fund.\u201d\n\nBut Angie Storozynski, an analyst representing Seaport Global Holdings on the call, balked at the the suggestion of new cash contributions by utilities to shore up the fund.\n\n\u201cAll of the fixes that we're hearing from the legislature seem temporary to me,\u201d she said, asking \u201cwhat's the incentive, really, to an investor to support California utilities given the headaches ... and the fact that you're not really being remunerated for the higher risk that you are accepting?

President and CEO Bob Frenzel said the company believes it can prove its equipment did not start the fire.\n\nThe company is already paying claims on another fire, the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire in the Texas panhandle, on which it faces an estimated $290 million in liability.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nXcel Energy remains open to settling with the more than 500 parties suing the utility for the Marshall Fire. But any settlement, Frenzel said Thursday, must \u201cstart with the idea that our equipment didn't cause that second\u201d ignition.\n\nHearings are set to begin on Sept. 25 and will likely continue through November now that the July 31 deadline for court-ordered mediation has passed, Frenzel said. When the fire started, he said, the embers on the Twelve Tribes property were fanned by 100 miles per hour winds for over an hour and 20 minutes, allowing it to spread into nearby towns long before the second ignition at Xcel Energy's power line is alleged to have taken place, he said.\n\n\u201cAs we step back and think about the trial broadly and the fire broadly, we continue to maintain that our equipment didn't start the second ignition in the wildfire, and we're prepared to go to court,\u201d Frenzel said, later adding that \u201cwe feel very good about the facts and circumstances of our trial.\u201d\n\nInsurance data suggest the fire caused about $2 billion in damages, but the actual liability the company could face would not be determined until a second trail that would only take place if the first trial this fall concluded Xcel Energy was at fault, Frenzel said.\n\nMeanwhile, CFO Brian Van Abel reported that Xcel Energy has so far committed to $176 million in settlement agreements for claims related to the Smokehouse Creek fire, which he said remains on track to trigger a total of about $290 million in liability. These costs should be covered by the company's $500 million insurance policy, Van Abel said.\n\nCompany leaders also announced their intent to add some $15 billion in capital investment to its existing $45-billion capital plan in order to serve growing demand and reliability needs. The $15 billion figure includes a need for 5.2 GW of new generation and storage to be placed into service by 2030, and $3 billion to $4 billion for at least two regional transmission projects, Frenzel said. The company expects to release more details on its revamped five-year capital plan, including its plans for financing the expansion, following the close of the third quarter.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Xcel Energy faces wildfire trial, plans massive capital expansion.\n\n**Key details:**\nXcel Energy failed to settle in court-ordered mediation for the 2021 Marshall Fire and will now proceed to trial starting September 25. The company's CEO, Bob Frenzel, maintains that Xcel's equipment did not cause the fire's second ignition. Separately, Xcel Energy is addressing an estimated $290 million in liability for the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire, with $176 million already committed in settlements. Concurrently, the utility announced plans to add $15 billion to its existing capital plan, targeting 5.2 GW of new generation and storage by 2030.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nXcel Energy's decision to go to trial over the Marshall Fire, rather than settling, signals a prolonged legal battle and potential for significant uninsurable liability, estimated at $2 billion in damages. This directly challenges the 2023 Boulder County Sheriff's investigation that partially attributed the fire to Xcel's power line. For investors, this creates heightened uncertainty around future financial obligations, as the company insists its equipment was not responsible for a key ignition. Additionally, the planned $15 billion capital investment represents a substantial future financial commitment, which the company will detail later this year.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe 2021 Marshall Fire was attributed by a 2023 investigation to the merging of two ignitions: one from a Twelve Tribes property and another from an Xcel Energy power line. Xcel Energy faces more than 500 parties suing it over this fire and is simultaneously managing an estimated $290 million in liability from the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire. These legal challenges unfold as Xcel Energy seeks to significantly expand its infrastructure to meet growing demand and reliability needs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$2 billion:** Estimated damages from the 2021 Marshall Fire.\n*   **$290 million:** Estimated total liability for the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire.\n*   **$15 billion:** New capital investment Xcel Energy plans to add.\n*   **$500 million:** Xcel Energy's insurance policy coverage for the Smokehouse Creek Fire.\n*   **500+:** Parties suing Xcel Energy for the Marshall Fire.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Xcel Energy:** Utility facing legal trials and liabilities from two major wildfires while planning a significant capital expansion.\n*   **Bob Frenzel:** Xcel Energy President and CEO, stated the company believes its equipment did not cause the second Marshall Fire ignition.\n*   **Brian Van Abel:** Xcel Energy CFO, reported on settlement agreements and insurance coverage for the Smokehouse Creek Fire.\n*   **Boulder County Sheriff:** Conducted a 2023 investigation attributing two independent ignitions to the 2021 Marshall Fire.\n*   **Twelve Tribes:** Religious organization whose property contained old fire kindling, identified as one Marshall Fire ignition source.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Marshall Fire trial hearings are set to begin on September 25 and will likely continue through November.\n*   Xcel Energy expects to release more details on its revamped five-year capital plan after the close of the third quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nXcel faces major wildfire legal battles and vast capital spending, impacting future finances.",

PPL Electric Utilities has a 60-GW data center interconnection queue, according to Sorgi.\n\nPPL\u2019s data center strategy includes an unregulated joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build power plants in Pennsylvania to directly serve data centers. \u201cThe joint venture is actively engaged with hyperscalers, landowners, natural gas pipeline companies and turbine manufacturers and has secured multiple land parcels to enable this new generation buildout,\u201d Sorgi said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHowever, discussions on potential electricity service agreements aren\u2019t far enough along for the joint venture to commit to buying turbines and it is unclear when it would be able to announce any news, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe've made no material financial commitments to date as it relates to the joint venture,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL intends to make sure that the joint venture\u2019s deals don\u2019t change the company\u2019s credit risk profile, Sorgi said.\n\nPPL supports pending legislation in Pennsylvania \u2014 H.B. 1272 and S.B. 897 \u2014 that would allow regulated utilities like PPL Electric Utilities to build and own generation to address a resource adequacy need, Sorgi said.\n\nThe bills would also encourage utilities to enter into agreements with independent power producers to help \u201cderisk\u201d their new generation investments, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe are primed to act quickly once this proposed legislation becomes law,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL Electric Utilities estimates it will need about 7.5 GW of new generation in the next five to seven years, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cGiven both federal and state support for new natural gas plants, natural gas pipeline expansion and streamlined siting and permitting, we are optimistic this generation can get built,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL estimates that it costs about $2.2 million to $2.5 million per MW to build a gas-fired combined cycle power plant, according to Sorgi.\n\nThe PJM Interconnection\u2019s last two capacity auctions will increase customer bills by about $20 a month, without bringing new generation onto the grid, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cThat was simply a transfer of wealth from utility customers to IPPs and to their shareholders,\u201d Sorgi said. \u201cWhat we're seeing in the market today is contracting long-term deals with hyperscalers for nuclear capacity. I would expect that to continue.\u201d\n\nIPPs are reluctant to build new generation because it would cannibalize the value of their existing fleets by lowering capacity prices, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cSo it's not a surprise to us that the competitive markets are not delivering on this much needed generation,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, PJM\u2019s interconnection queue has about 10 GW of new generation in Pennsylvania, with about 1.2 GW of dispatchable gas and nuclear generation, with the rest comprised of solar and batteries, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe see real issues with the solar developers being able to get their projects completed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we're clearly staring at a near-term supply and demand issue that we believe needs to be addressed ASAP.\u201d\n\nPPL expects its utilities in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will spend $20 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2025 to 2028, resulting in average annual rate base growth of 9.8%, according to Sorgi.\n\nWhile PPL expects strong customer growth in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, weather-normalized sales at the company\u2019s utilities in the states grew 0.5% in the second quarter and were essentially flat over the previous 12 months, according to the presentation.\n\nIn the second quarter, residential sales dipped 0.5% in Pennsylvania.

        "summary": "**Headline:** PPL Nears Major Data Center Power Deals, Advocates Generation Law\n\n**Key details:** PPL Electric Utilities has advanced-stage agreements to interconnect approximately 14 GW of data centers in Pennsylvania, marking a 32% increase in three months. The utility\u2019s total data center interconnection queue currently stands at 60 GW. PPL is also pursuing an unregulated joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build power plants for data centers in Pennsylvania. While engaged with various parties, this joint venture has made no material financial commitments to date regarding turbine purchases. PPL supports pending Pennsylvania legislation (H.B. 1272 and S.B. 897) that would permit regulated utilities to build and own generation to meet resource needs.\n\n**Why it matters:** This rapid growth in data center demand signals a significant and concentrated future electricity load for PPL. PPL's direct advocacy for legislative changes challenges the current consensus that competitive markets and independent power producers (IPPs) are sufficient to meet growing generation needs. The company argues that IPPs are reluctant to build new generation due to market cannibalization, and PJM Interconnection's auctions are not delivering new capacity. This implies a potential shift where regulated utilities, if enabled by law, could become primary developers of new generation, contrasting with the existing market-driven approach.\n\n**The big picture:** The energy sector is grappling with soaring electricity demand, particularly from data centers, which require substantial power infrastructure. PPL's strategy involves both regulated utility interconnections and an unregulated joint venture to address this growing load. The company perceives a critical near-term supply and demand imbalance, criticizing the current competitive market structure for failing to deliver necessary new generation. PPL is actively seeking legislative solutions to empower utilities to construct generation assets, citing optimism for natural gas plant construction with federal and state support.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **14 GW:** Advanced-stage data center interconnection agreements for PPL Electric Utilities.\n*   **60 GW:** Total data center interconnection queue for PPL Electric Utilities.\n*   **$20 billion:** Expected infrastructure improvements spending by PPL utilities from 2025 to 2028.\n*   **9.8%:** Projected average annual rate base growth resulting from infrastructure investments.\n*   **7.5 GW:** New generation PPL Electric Utilities estimates it will need in the next 5-7 years.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **PPL Electric Utilities:** Has advanced agreements for data center interconnections and a large development queue.\n*   **PPL Corp.:** Parent company, whose CEO outlined data center strategy and legislative support.\n*   **Vincent Sorgi:** President and CEO of PPL Corp., provided key updates on data center demand and market issues.\n*   **Blackstone Infrastructure:** Joint venture partner with PPL in an unregulated effort to build power plants.\n*   **PJM Interconnection:** Grid operator criticized for capacity auctions that increased bills without new generation.\n*   **Independent Power Producers (IPPs):** Reluctant to build new generation, accused of contributing to market issues.\n*   **Joseph Bergstein:** PPL chief financial officer, explained the cause of industrial sales declines.\n*   **Hyperscalers:** Key data center customers engaged with PPL's joint venture for long-term power deals.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Passage of pending Pennsylvania legislation (H.B. 1272 and S.B. 897) enabling regulated utilities to build generation.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** PPL eyes data centers for growth, pushing legislative changes to boost generation.",

What mattered wasn\u2019t the technology alone, but its ability to deliver visibility, control and verifiable response when it counted.\n\nWe are entering a similar moment with AI data centers, which arrive with load profiles that are shaping up to be large and urgent, but also increasingly dispatch-aware to the grid and power efficiency-aware to the providers of software and hardware behind the fence. The architecture is different. The topology is different. But the \u201cask\u201d is familiar: allow us to participate in grid stress management \u2014 not just consume \u2014 and the capital will flow to the solutions that enable flexible, grid-supportive outcomes. With the right planning framework, flexible assets can be integrated into the grid\u2019s living system.\n\nThat vision requires us to extend the same logic we\u2019ve spent a decade refining \u2014 how we plan for flexibility, how we model load shapes, how we co-invest in infrastructure, and how we compensate response \u2014 across all sides of the grid, not just at the edge. We\u2019ve certainly spent years proving that distributed energy can perform, so let us spend only months achieving the same for large load users. The opportunity awaits to unlock a different grid future, in which AI systems and human communities are powered by the same infrastructure, not competing versions of it. Capital flows in this future toward shared reliability outcomes, not toward expensive off-grid isolation. Our grid policies are an invitation for capital investment in the grid edge and in data center load response, and both investments yield value-based returns in the shape of virtual power plants and grid-responsive AI load.\n\nWe are already seeing where the grid is strained and which loads contribute to system risk and which can be responsive, dispatchable and resilient. We are already seeing capital flow toward both backup and interactive infrastructure. We can choose to unlock that participation, or we can choose to let the workarounds proliferate.\n\nReimagine interconnection and hosting capacity methods for flexible loads\n\nIt is no longer sufficient to run load interconnection studies on the assumption of a fixed, unchanging, 24/7 draw. That\u2019s not how today\u2019s demand behaves, nor should we motivate that behavior. And it\u2019s certainly not how AI data centers will behave when the right controls are enabled. Compute and non-compute workload performance and site-level flexibility can be aligned. We\u2019ve seen AI customers demonstrate load modulation without breaking compute operations. But utility interconnection pathways must accept these profiles in the first place. We should be clear-eyed about what this requires: updated screening tools, revised reliability models and planning processes that accept flexibility declarations with enforceable parameters. If a site operator can curtail or shift 40 MW with advance notice and software-based controls, or place a battery next to the load to do the shaping work so the load itself does not need to curtail, the grid should not plan as if that site is inflexible. And if we design connection queues and hosting maps around worst-case peaks only, we will get worst-case costs and delays.\n\nCreate co-location pathways with grid-side or long-duration storage\n\nThe instinct to self-provide is not going away. In every jurisdiction where interconnection is slow or capacity is constrained, the market is responding the only way it knows how: by building behind-the-fence solutions \u2014 batteries, diesel gensets, gas peakers. The question is whether those assets will help the grid or simply bypass it. We should design for the former. Utilities should develop technical interconnection standards, standard offer tariffs and integrated planning models that support co-location of large-scale storage with load. These storage assets can provide grid services, shave peaks and help avoid curtailment. But only if the grid is willing to treat co-located storage \u2014 and natural gas generators \u2014 as more than a private insurance policy.\n\nSet standards for fault ride-through and grid services participation from non-traditional facilities\n\nThere are thousands of buildings, campuses and compute clusters that were never designed to serve the grid \u2014 but now can. These facilities already have the capabilities: backup generators, battery banks, power control systems, software-defined operations. What they lack is a clear path to participate. We can fix that. Interconnection rules should allow for ride-through behavior from these systems. Ancillary service markets should invite aggregated load with dispatchable response. Invert the model: rather than designating who is allowed to help, define the performance that helps \u2014 and open the door to whoever can meet it. The \u201cwho\u201d can be aggregated distributed resources; it can be compute campuses \u2014 invite the participation and the right resources will come.\n\nAlign cost-sharing and offtake structures with actual system benefit and risk\n\nRight now, most interconnecting load is asked to bear the full cost of infrastructure upgrades, even when those upgrades solve broader grid problems or serve multiple customers. This is an inefficient and oddly punitive outcome that creates a disincentive for precisely the types of customers who are willing to invest in flexible, grid-serving design. Instead, utilities and commissions should adopt frameworks that allocate upgrade costs based on dispatch characteristics, controllability and demand flex contribution to system reliability. If a customer lowers system peak by 30%, that should matter. If they bring long-duration storage to self-provide at peak, or are willing to accept curtailment, that should matter. The same applies to power purchase risk. When AI customers face long-term, inflexible energy procurement contracts that ignore workload variability, we risk that they simply walk away \u2014 making power deals uneconomic at scale. Let\u2019s modernize those terms by offering indexed pricing structures that reward grid-supportive behavior. Recognize the load shapes of the future \u2014 not just the shapes of the past.\n\nConduct new system stability studies that incorporate compute and non-compute dispatch profiles\n\nToday\u2019s studies are still anchored in outdated assumptions. They model data center load as a flat wall of constant demand. That\u2019s not what these sites do. Compute ramps up and down. Cooling is weather-sensitive. Workloads can queue, pause, or reschedule. There are differences between training and inference, and even within those categories themselves. There are differences between AI and traditional cloud. The system studies need to catch up. At a minimum, planning authorities should require developers to submit load shape scenarios based on anticipated operations. These scenarios can and should be validated by real telemetry once sites are live. We already do this for generation. It\u2019s time to do it for load.\n\nSupport \u2018Energy for AI\u2019 and \u2018DER as infrastructure\u2019 through clear, tech-agnostic, service-specific policies\n\nEverything above rests on this final principle: if we want private capital to fund the grid of the future, we must be clear about what earns value. Flexibility must be treated as infrastructure. Energy for AI must be judged not by how much it uses, but by how well it performs. We need to set standards for what good participation looks like \u2014 and allow market, utility and community stakeholders to meet those standards in diverse, verifiable ways. That means policies that are tech-agnostic on whether flexibility comes from a 100-MW hyperscale campus or a thousand residential batteries. What matters is the reliability contribution. The system value. If a resource shows up when the grid is straining, it counts.",

IIEC is receiving a refund for capacity charges its members paid.\n\nThe parties asked FERC to approve the agreement by Aug. 29.\n\nFERC responded to the complaints over the capacity auction with two decisions. In December 2015, the commission ordered MISO to change its tariff provisions related to market power mitigation and how it calculates capacity import limits, which the agency said were no longer just and reasonable. In a 3-1 July 2019 decision, FERC found the Zone 4 auction results to be just and reasonable.\n\nThen-FERC Commissioner Richard Glick dissented from the second decision and criticized then-FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee for unilaterally ending the enforcement office\u2019s investigation into Dynegy\u2019s market behavior.\n\nHowever, in 2021, an appeals court agreed with Public Citizen that FERC\u2019s rationale for dismissing the complaints was \u201cunreasoned\u201d and directed FERC to reconsider its findings.\n\nA year later, FERC\u2019s enforcement office said in a report that Dynegy schemed to drive up capacity prices to $150/MW-day in MISO\u2019s zone 4, while capacity cleared at $3.29/MW-day to $3.48/MW-day in MISO\u2019s eight other zones in the 2015/16 auction.\n\n\u201cDynegy engaged in a scheme \u2026 to amass and hoard megawatts that might otherwise have been offered into the auction at a zero price, thereby increasing the likelihood that a Dynegy resource offered into the auction at a non-zero price would become the marginal resource, setting the clearing price,\u201d enforcement office staff said.\n\nAfter the report was released, FERC in June 2024 ordered a hearing on the dispute, but held it in abeyance to encourage the parties to reach a settlement.\n\n\u201cPublic Citizen prevailed over a politically-motivated decision by a previous chairman to dismiss a market manipulation investigation despite FERC's enforcement staff concluding Dynegy engaged in market manipulation of MISO's capacity auction,\u201d Tyson Slocum, director of the consumer watchdog group\u2019s energy program, said in an email.\n\nThe case shows how easy it is for companies to manipulate regional transmission organization capacity auctions and underscores the need for stronger safeguards to protect consumers from capacity market manipulation, Slocum said.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJohn Shegerian, ERI\u2019s CEO and co-founder, is on the road again. His company has made a name for itself as one of the largest electronics recyclers in the country, expanding over the years to do business in about 140 countries.\n\nAdvancements in the electronics at the heart of ERI\u2019s business model are also the reason Shegerian travels about 175 days a year, he said.\n\n\u201cWith technology, with AI, nobody knows what\u2019s real or fake anymore. But having real, personal relationships with clients and strategic partners \u2013 that\u2019s what sets us apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpersonal relationships you build with people face to face are now more important than ever before.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years, ERI has expanded its footprint across the U.S. It opened a new battery recycling plant in Indiana in 2024 and is getting ready to open an electronics recycling and IT asset disposition facility in Georgia. The company also plans to announce several international partnerships this year. This comes at a time when the U.S. government aims to prioritize domestic recycling initiatives in an effort to get back critical materials from electronics.\n\nERI is also balancing domestic and international business expansion with sustainability initiatives Shegerian said further set his company apart in a competitive field. \u201cIt doesn't matter if you\u2019re Republican, Independent or Democrat, everyone agrees that we want to leave the environment better than how we found it,\u201d he said.\n\nShegerian talked with Waste Dive about ERI\u2019s latest carbon neutral and zero waste initiatives, its focus on its battery and e-scrap services, and its relationship with the current Trump administration.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDomestic recycling infrastructure for electronics and batteries has seemed to really pick up in recent years, and you yourself have said competition can be fierce. What are ERI\u2019s priorities in this space, and how is it mapping its own growth?\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of ERI\n\nOnly 22% of all electronics being used today and sold and used on this planet today are being responsibly recycled. That still leaves a massive 78% delta for myself and all of my competitors to chase. People ask why I\u2019m friends with my competitors, and it\u2019s because we can learn a lot from them, and it's not a zero-sum game. There's so much stuff to recycle that we can all do very well together. It's really an industry of collaboration, and collaboration is what's going to make the biggest impact.\n\nOne example of collaboration that we\u2019ve had going since about 2005 is the electronic take-back programs with Best Buy and Staples, which is now the second most successful take-back program in the world for batteries and electronic waste. We also manage the Salvation Army take-back program now. We\u2019re always trying to get the word out, get more education and activation, because people want to do the right thing with electronics, they just don't know where it exists.\n\nWhen we take back all the batteries at Staples, you know about 85% of these postconsumer batteries are alkaline batteries. Our technology so far is doing very well at our recycling plant in Indiana, [which focuses on alkaline battery recycling]. It's closed loop, no emissions, and we create and sell a wonderful black mass there.\n\nAt the same time, we're opening other infrastructure. In the fourth quarter we plan to open our northwest Georgia location, which will do ITAD and electronics recycling, and we plan to continue to grow in other parts of the United States as well.\n\nWe are also going to grow outside of the country. We\u2019re getting more and more business in Asia, Canada, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We're going to be opening locations in those regions in the next 12 months in the form of ERI owned and operated [facilities], with partners in those regions.\n\nERI recently published its latest sustainability report, which says the company is the first in its industry to become carbon neutral . What steps did you take to do that, and why are these specific sustainability metrics important?\n\nWe started our company around 23 years ago, which is a lifetime ago when it comes to technology. That was before any company had a chief sustainability officer and \u201ccircular economy\u201d wasn\u2019t a word yet.\n\nIt does cost ERI more and requires more intentional work to be carbon neutral and to achieve zero waste. You just don't write a check and buy your way into it. Our carbon neutrality and zero waste efforts stand out really fast compared to our competitors.\n\nAll our big clients like the retailers, OEMs, cities and municipalities \u2014 they all have to answer to somebody and create sustainability or impact reports. We're one less problem on their balance sheet. We're not creating more scope 1, 2 or 3 issues for them.\n\nThe fact is, we have strategic partners that are investors and board members of ERI, so everyone knows where our materials go. Batteries go right to Redwood Materials. Alcoa gets all of our aluminum and LS MnM gets all of our copper and precious metals. People know there's no brokers. They see the transparency to that.\n\nWe have eight big facilities across America, but we never had a head of procurement until about two years ago, which is kind of embarrassing. Having a head of procurement is Sustainability 101. The march towards carbon neutrality becomes a lot easier when you're buying right and when you're diverting right.\n\nNo one's truly zero waste. We're at about 2.3% to 2.7% that goes to a hazardous waste landfill, but the rest gets diverted. Those efforts all came from our procurement and also from our chief sustainability officer efforts to increase and improve our diversion.\n\nOur sustainability officer and his team also look into how to power our facilities with green energy such as solar, and then whatever we can't do ourselves at the end of the day to zero out and reconcile this, then we'll buy credits.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pretty clear that it wants to see more investments in domestic manufacturing and the recovery of critical materials, which it says is important to stay internationally competitive and reduce reliance on other countries. What\u2019s ERI\u2019s role in these larger federal priorities?\n\nIn the last nine months, we've met with leadership from Canada, the United States and Japan. They all are interested in the same thing. They don't want to decouple from China, but they want to de-risk their resources and supply chain. The question on their minds is, \u201cHow can we recycle more electronics domestically and keep those material resources domestically?\u201d And that's what we've been asked to advise on.\n\nERI had an office in Washington, D.C. for 10 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we would walk the halls to meet with both sides of the aisle. Each side gave us wonderful lip service. The Republican people typically say, \u201cWe love the job growth that you're doing in our communities.\u201d The Democrats would say, \u201cWe love what you're doing for the environment.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s different with the Trump administration, love them or hate them, is that this is an administration of doers. They've come to us and said, \u201cGive us specifics. How can we retain more electronics, domestically speaking, and keep our resources domestic?\u201d They ask practical questions and they\u2019ve followed up with us numerous times. That\u2019s never happened in all the years I had an office in D.C.\n\nBy the way, the Canadian and Japanese governments are doing the same thing. I know each one of those administrations is going to do a lot more to make their countries safer and more independent and de-risk their supply chains. This is a high, high priority for all administrations of those three countries. This is just not idle chatter.\n\nERI is known for electronics and battery recycling, but you also do a fair amount of plastics recycling because of the plastics in electronics. How has that area of the business evolved over the years, especially in the context of your zero waste goals?\n\nPlastics have always been important to us. We built proprietary shredders back in 2008, and they have been upgraded every year. Those shredders create cleaner commodities, and smelters want the most liberated resources and commodities to smelt, because certain plastics will ruin their smelters.\n\nWhen OEMs started realizing that circularity and sustainability were trends, they all created design for sustainability divisions. One of the ways they want to make their products greener and more sustainable is by avoiding buying virgin plastic and instead buying back recycled plastic from me. We make sure it goes to a good vendor who can meet our specs. We've been working with OEMs for the last 15 years on this, but now more and more OEMs are doing that. What they're realizing is that young people are voting with their pocketbooks and want to buy greener and greener products.\n\nWe've chased this space vigorously for 15 years, and we continue to chase it. We continue to find great vendors on different continents that can help us recycle our plastic that we create in those continents and then also fulfill the needs of our OEMs.",

The company is set to announce several international partnerships this year and will open owned and operated locations in Asia, Canada, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East within 12 months. ERI recently became the first in its industry to achieve carbon neutrality and operates with a near zero-waste model.\n\n**Why it matters:** This expansion positions ERI for significant growth in a market where only 22% of electronics are responsibly recycled, leaving a large 78% opportunity. ERI's carbon neutral and near zero-waste status differentiates it, potentially attracting major clients seeking to reduce their own sustainability footprints. The company's unique, practical engagement with the Trump administration on domestic material retention suggests a more active government role in recycling than commonly perceived, challenging a consensus view of policy inaction in this area.\n\n**The big picture:** ERI is a major electronics recycler operating globally, with its CEO emphasizing personal relationships in a technology-driven world. The U.S. government prioritizes domestic recycling to recover critical materials and de-risk supply chains. Despite fierce competition, the industry offers vast potential, as a significant volume of e-waste remains un-recycled.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Operates in about 140 countries.\n*   CEO travels about 175 days a year.\n*   Only 22% of all electronics are responsibly recycled globally.\n*   Electronic take-back programs with Best Buy and Staples began around 2005, ranking as the second most successful worldwide.\n*   ERI diverts 97.3% to 97.7% of its waste from hazardous landfills.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **John Shegerian:** ERI\u2019s CEO and co-founder, travels extensively to build client relationships for the company.\n*   **ERI:** A major electronics recycler expanding domestically and internationally, achieving carbon neutrality.\n*   **Best Buy:** Partnered with ERI since 2005 on electronic take-back programs.\n*   **Staples:** Collaborates with ERI on one of the world's most successful electronic take-back programs.\n*   **Salvation Army:** ERI now manages their electronic take-back program.\n*   **Redwood Materials:** Receives batteries recycled by ERI.\n*   **Alcoa:** Receives aluminum recycled by ERI.\n*   **LS MnM:** Receives copper and precious metals recycled by ERI.\n*   **Trump administration:** Engaged directly with ERI, seeking specific advice on domestic electronics recycling.\n*   **Canadian government:** Met with ERI seeking advice on de-risking resources and supply chains.\n*   **Japanese government:** Met with ERI seeking advice on de-risking resources and supply chains.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   ERI plans to open its northwest Georgia IT asset disposition and electronics recycling facility in Q4.\n*   ERI will announce several international partnerships this year and open owned and operated international locations within 12 months.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** ERI poised for global growth amid strategic domestic and sustainable expansion.",

        "summary_text": "This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFinancial picture: During the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call on Friday, CEO John Casella characterized the quarter as a time of \u201cstrong growth,\u201d particularly due to stable performance across the company\u2019s Northeast footprint and improved landfill tons compared to this time last year. Revenue growth for the quarter was mainly driven by the rollover impact from acquisitions and \u201csustained\u201d collection and disposal price growth, he said.\n\nM&A: Casella completed six acquisitions in the first half of this year, representing over $90 million in annualized revenue. Three of those deals closed in Q2, totalling over $40 million in annualized revenues, said President Ned Coletta. The acquisition pipeline for 2025 has over $500 million of annualized revenue opportunities, he said. The company\u2019s strategy is to solidify investments it\u2019s made along the Eastern Seaboard, including the Mid-Atlantic, while also seeking new business in those regions, John Casella added.\n\nMountain State Waste acquisition: Casella announced in July that it planned to acquire Mountain State Waste in West Virginia, which will add an incremental $30 million of annualized revenues after it closes. The acquisition will help broaden Casella's footprint in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky. The company\u2019s West Virginia base and location near the college town of Morgantown \u201cwill give us a lot of growth,\u201d John Casella said.\n\nMid-Atlantic optimization hurdles: Labor costs in the Mid-Atlantic region are currently \u201chundreds of basis points higher\u201d than in other regions where Casella operates, in part because \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of automation and optimization of routes, and that won\u2019t all get solved at once,\u201d Coletta said. At the same time, truck delivery delays have further slowed optimization plans.\n\nTruck and route optimization: Casella expects about 55 more trucks to be delivered to the Mid-Atlantic region later in the year, 40 of which are automated, he said. Meanwhile, the company completed 11 other route optimization projects in the Eastern and Western regions that helped offset hurdles in the Mid-Atlantic, he said.\n\nPrice: Solid waste pricing for the quarter was up 5% year over year, with 4.9% collection price growth and 5.8% disposal price growth.\n\nVolumes: Landfill volumes were up 9.5% year over year, driven in part by higher third-party MSW and C&D volumes due to the ongoing effects of the Brookhaven Landfill closure in New York. Casella also saw over 12% growth in internalized volumes.\n\nResource Solutions: Resource Solutions revenues were up 10% year over year to about $95.8 million , with recycling and other processing revenue up 9.6%. Average commodity sales prices were down 16% from the previous year. However, higher volumes at Casella\u2019s MRFs in Boston and Willimantic, Connecticut, helped offset that price impact, said CFO Brad Helgeson.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Casella Sees Strong Q2 Growth Amid Acquisitions, Eyes Future Expansion\n\n**Key details:** Casella reported \"strong growth\" in Q2, attributed to stable Northeast performance and improved landfill tons. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the rollover impact from acquisitions and ongoing price increases in collection and disposal services. The company completed six acquisitions in the first half of the year, adding over $90 million in annualized revenue, with three deals closing in Q2. Solid waste pricing saw a 5% year-over-year increase, and landfill volumes rose by 9.5% compared to last year. Resource Solutions revenues also increased by 10% year over year to about $95.8 million.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information matters as Casella's reported \"strong growth,\" significant acquisition activity, and consistent price increases suggest robust operational performance. The company's strategy to solidify Eastern Seaboard investments and pursue new business signals continued expansion. However, high labor costs and truck delivery delays in the Mid-Atlantic region are identified as significant optimization hurdles. These specific regional challenges could challenge a consensus view of uniformly smooth and unhindered growth across all of Casella's operating areas.\n\n**The big picture:** The context for this news comes from Casella's Q2 earnings call, where the CEO characterized the period as one of \"strong growth.\" The company's strategic focus involves solidifying existing investments along the Eastern Seaboard, including the Mid-Atlantic, while actively seeking new business opportunities in these same regions. Increased landfill volumes were partly driven by the ongoing effects of the Brookhaven Landfill closure in New York, contributing to overall growth.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Six acquisitions completed in the first half of this year.\n*   Over $90 million in annualized revenue from H1 acquisitions.\n*   Solid waste pricing was up 5% year over year.\n*   Landfill volumes increased 9.5% year over year.\n*   Acquisition pipeline for 2025 has over $500 million of annualized revenue opportunities.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **John Casella:** CEO who characterized Q2 as \"strong growth\" and discussed company strategy.\n*   **Ned Coletta:** President who detailed acquisition revenue and Mid-Atlantic labor/truck challenges.\n*   **Brad Helgeson:** CFO who discussed Resource Solutions revenue and commodity sales prices.\n*   **Mountain State Waste:** Planned acquisition in West Virginia, adding $30 million annualized revenue.\n*   **Brookhaven Landfill:** Its closure in New York contributed to Casella's increased landfill volumes.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The planned acquisition of Mountain State Waste is expected to close.\n*   Approximately 55 more trucks are expected to be delivered to the Mid-Atlantic region later in the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Casella rides acquisition wave and strong pricing, but faces Mid-Atlantic optimization hurdles.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPaper cups are for the first time part of the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s materials specifications list, the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. Graphic Packaging International praised the cups update, calling it \u201ca major milestone in a broader movement to increase awareness and drive greater collection of paper cups in recycling systems,\u201d according to a Monday news release.\n\nReMa's ISRI specifications set standards for the quality of recycled materials and serve as a guide for scrap material buyers' and sellers' transactions. However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nArtificial intelligence is changing the face of waste education. City staff and facility operators are looking beyond just paper mailers and public service announcements to cameras, screens and text prompts. The technology is designed to meet users at the bins and help them navigate the complexities of local recycling rules.\n\nAI has been used to identify items and trigger physical separation within MRFs for years, and more recently it\u2019s even been implemented to track contamination levels at the point of collection when haulers integrate camera systems into their trucks. But neither of these use cases go as far upstream as trying to help consumers make the right decision about where to put their refuse, recyclables or organics.\n\n\u201cThis was really an effort to help people better understand small nuances, and it also gave us new insights about common questions and gaps in knowledge,\u201d said Pamela Perez, the marketing manager for LA Sanitation & Environment, which recently introduced Professor Green, an AI tool for organics recycling education.\n\nProponents of these AI feedback systems hope they can cut down on contamination and increase capture rates, but the technology is still evolving.\n\nWhether the tools are chatbots or item-identifying cameras, operators have to tinker with the software over time and hone its ability to offer users the right responses. Experts say that accurate item identification \u2014 particularly at the curb, where trash and recycling come in an almost infinite number of forms \u2014 could be a challenge for some iterations of this consumer-facing AI. Another hurdle will be convincing consumers to use it.\n\nSend a text or take a photo\n\nContamination rates remain stubbornly high, as recycling rates are also stagnant in many parts of the U.S.\n\nIn New York City, for example, non-recyclable contaminants in the metal, plastic and glass waste stream have gone from nearly 34 pounds to almost 49 pounds per household between 2017 and 2023. The Recycling Partnership estimated in 2020 that the inbound material contamination rate was 17%.\n\nWaste and recycling professionals hoping to improve these statistics are looking to AI as enabling coaching for residents and visitors on the spot.\n\nA rendering of Oscar Sort\u2019s AI-enable sorting technology, which uses cameras to help people decide where to place their items at airports, universities and other public areas. Permission granted by Intuitive AI\n\nSome public-facing AI sorting systems identify items the same way MRF technologies do. Oscar Sort, a platform offered by Intuitive AI, uses a camera to see what a user is holding. A follow-up message on a mounted screen shows which bin to drop it in \u2014 trash, recycling, compost, or even (as one client requested) a chopstick-only receptacle for a recycling service to turn into wooden furniture. The software can also offer multi-part instructions, like directing a coffee cup to the trash bin and a cardboard sleeve to the recycling bin.\n\nIn the U.S., facilities such as the San Francisco Ferry Building and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport are in the early stages of using Oscar on site. The company says over 25 airports and 50 universities asked to become customers in the last year.\n\nEach Oscar installation costs $10,000 to $15,000, after which yearly services and data fees cost $5,500 to $6,500, said Brian Sano, head of strategy at Intuitive AI. In 2024, the company launched an ad-based offering \u2014 brands can pay to advertise on the embedded screens, generating potentially enough revenue for the facility to cover annual maintenance costs and then some.\n\nConsumer-facing sorting AI can also take in what the public offers via text, which is how the city of Los Angeles opted for its technology to operate.\n\nProfessor Green, the AI educator built for the city by software company Hello Lamp Post, works like a chatbot. Users in one of four pilot neighborhoods \u2014 Porter Ranch, Northridge, South LA and Watts \u2014 scan a QR code or go to the city website to text Professor Green. The system replies to tell users if their item can go in a city-provided green bin, or their trash or recycling bins instead. The chatbot understands and replies to English, Spanish, Korean, Tagalog, Ethiopian and Armenian \u2014 languages selected to best serve populations in the pilot area.\n\nIdeally, Professor Green clears up local confusion about composting rules. The City of Los Angeles has a lot of residents who move in to the municipality and might not be familiar with local guidelines, Perez said, or need help parsing the rules from those of nearby areas. For example, some of the other municipalities in Los Angeles County asks that residents line their bins with compostable bags, but the city of Los Angeles only accepts paper-product liners.\n\nToo few trash photos\n\nBoth Intuitive AI and LA Sanitation staff dip into the data to make sure that their programs are identifying items correctly.\n\nIntuitive AI does this for Oscar customers by comparing the instructions Oscar offered to the recordings of what the user was holding, every day, along with four waste audits a year for most customers.\n\nLA Sanitation staff also comb through Professor Green requests every day. They spend at most an hour on the inquiries, which is often more than enough time to spot any issues. For example, staff taught the AI to respond to questions about tamale waste, but soon realized it didn\u2019t know corn husks were part of the food. Perez said the team has since instructed Professor Green to associate the two.\n\nText-based sorting inquiries will likely give users more accurate instructions than camera-based technology, said Sharon Hsiao, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University.\n\nThat\u2019s because having people tell the AI what they\u2019re trying to dispose of gets around the issue of having to train the software to recognize what trash looks like. Written prompts can still run a wide range. As Perez pointed out, her office had a long list of terms for \u201cpet waste\u201d that Professor Green needed to recognize. But visual identification has even more variability.\n\n\u201cCigarette butts or COVID masks \u2014 those are very distinct,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cBut if you crumple up paper, it won\u2019t always be the same shape.\u201d\n\nThere are also few photos of trash that are freely available for AI models to learn from.\n\nHsiao and her colleagues tried to compile a database of these publicly accessible training images when building an AI waste sorter that relies on a smartphone camera. Not only were there too few images to train the software, but the computational power that would be needed for the AI to recognize any possible item goes beyond anything a smart phone can handle, Hsiao said.\n\nAn AI system focused on waste requires a small computer and is more likely to be accurate if developers can train the software to recognize a limited array of items, Hsiao said. Places that restrict the kinds of materials allowed inside, like entertainment venues or airports, could be a natural fit.\n\nLower barriers are better\n\nExperts expect technology to play an increasing role as local governments and facility operators look for ways to evolve their recycling education. But figuring out what will resonate with the public is an ongoing process.\n\nAI-enabled camera systems might be easier for users, despite being harder to teach. In surveys, Hsiao and her team found that people are likely to think of texting or responding to voice prompts as more work than waiting for a camera to register what it\u2019s seeing. And all of these options were considered significantly more time-consuming than the status quo \u2014the split-second decision of throwing items into whichever bin it seems to belong.\n\n\u201cAll the people that we surveyed wanted to be able to use their phone to scan items to tell them which bin it's supposed to be in,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cIn reality, they actually don't do it.\u201d\n\nTo convince people to take the time and use the AI identification they claim to want, Hsiao and her colleagues are working on a sorting system that also tells users about the benefits of their actions. Her team is experimenting with feedback about money or greenhouse gas emissions saved via correct sorting.\n\nFor now, the simpler text-based Professor Green option appears to be resonating. Los Angelenos have had over 4,000 conversations with the AI since its debut in March. Use has been particularly high in South LA, a low-income neighborhood where the majority of households speak Spanish at home.\n\nLA Sanitation is now looking at expanding Professor Green to other neighborhoods in the future. But to know for certain whether the AI system is meaningfully changing contamination rates or diverting more material from landfills, Perez and her team would have to see the results of a more old-fashioned tool: A waste audit.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Waste Dive: Recycling newsletter.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nOverall results: A down market for manufacturing weighed on Republic Services' earnings, particularly its environmental services business, but the company still reported growth in revenue and margins for the quarter. CEO Jon Vander Ark attributed organic revenue growth to pricing in excess of inflation. While core price was down year over year, the company still reported that core price on total revenue increased revenue by 5.7%.\n\nLabor disruption: Republic projects the strikes and extended picket lines several chapters of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called this month could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on adjusted earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2025. Vander Ark said the company primarily felt the impact through the increased costs from bringing in outside workers to replace those on strike in markets like the Boston area, where the strikes began on July 1. The company also plans to issue \"some credits\" to affected customers, though executives did not detail that plan. \"We're actively ready to negotiate and hopefully get through it quickly, but we're also prepared for any scenario,\" Vander Ark said.\n\nVolumes: Cleanup from hurricane debris in the Carolinas and wildfire debris in California provided a significant tailwind to landfill volumes . C&D waste was up 47.3% and special waste was up 22.4% in Q2, while MSW was down 2.1%. On collections, residential volumes were down 3.2%. Large container waste was also down 3.4%, which executives said reflects continued softness in the construction market.\n\nEnvironmental Solutions: Republic Services\u2019 environmental services business saw a 2.4% decrease in revenue year over year. Executives attributed that to continued softness in manufacturing activity, as well as tariff uncertainty and lower event-based volumes compared to last year. The segment still grew 1.6% in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024 due to a particularly strong Q1. Shamrock Environmental, which Republic acquired at the start of the year, is expected to contribute positively to earnings as well for the year.\n\nManufacturing slump: CFO Brian DelGhiaccio noted that since Republic Services acquired US Ecology in 2023, the manufacturing environment has been in a slump. That's impacted not just the company's environmental services segment but its $1.5 billion market vertical in recycling and waste that's focused on manufacturing end markets, he said. But executives expect the macro environment for manufacturing to turn around in the coming years and improve the business as a whole. \"What we've done in a negative demand environment gives us a lot of confidence and really encourages us about what the future could bring when manufacturing activity actually resumes,\" DelGhiaccio said.\n\nRecycling: Republic's average recycled commodity price per ton was $149 in Q2, down $24 per ton year over year. Nevertheless, revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales were up slightly year over year, driven by increased volumes at the company's polymer centers and the reopening of a facility on the West Coast. Republic's Indianapolis Polymer Center began commercial production in July, and is projected to reach commercial production in Q4.\n\nSustainability: Republic issued its 2024 sustainability report this week, highlighting its progress on reducing emissions. On the call, executives highlighted sustainability efforts like its fleet electrification initiative. Republic is still on track to have 150 electric collection vehicles in operation by the end of the year, and currently has 114 in operation. The company also brought f our renewable natural gas facilities online in Q2, and plans to open seven total by the end of the year.\n\nGuidance: The company opted to revise down its full-year revenue guidance by $175 million, and now projects a range of $16.675 billion to $16.75 billion. That was due to lower commodity prices and volumes. Republic's adjusted EBITDA guidance remained the same, while its adjusted free cash flow guidance increased slightly to reflect the contributions from 100% bonus depreciation enacted in the recent tax bill.",

Organic revenue growth was driven by pricing in excess of inflation, with core price on total revenue increasing revenue by 5.7%. Labor disruptions from Teamsters strikes could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on 2025 adjusted earnings.

However, adjusted free cash flow guidance increased slightly due to 100% bonus depreciation from a recent tax bill.\n\n**Why it matters:** Republic's ability to grow revenue and margins through pricing, even in a \"negative demand environment\" for manufacturing, highlights its operational resilience. The projected financial impact from labor disputes introduces a new, quantifiable risk to future earnings.

The CFO noted that the manufacturing environment has been in a slump since Republic acquired US Ecology in 2023, impacting environmental services and a $1.5 billion market vertical. Executives expect the macro manufacturing environment to turn around in coming years, which would improve the business as a whole. Cleanup from hurricane debris in the Carolinas and wildfire debris in California provided a significant tailwind to landfill volumes.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Core price on total revenue increased revenue by 5.7%.\n* Labor disruptions could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on 2025 adjusted earnings.\n* Full-year revenue guidance revised down by $175 million, to $16.675 billion to $16.75 billion.\n* Environmental services business saw a 2.4% decrease in revenue year over year.\n* Average recycled commodity price per ton was $149 in Q2, down $24 year over year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Republic Services:** Waste management company reporting earnings, revenue growth, and revised guidance amid market challenges.\n*   **Jon Vander Ark:** CEO of Republic Services, attributed organic revenue growth and commented on labor dispute preparedness.\n*   **International Brotherhood of Teamsters:** Union whose strikes and picket lines could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on Republic's 2025 earnings.\n*   **Brian DelGhiaccio:** CFO of Republic Services, noted the manufacturing environment slump impacting the company since 2023.\n*   **US Ecology:** Company acquired by Republic Services in 2023, after which the manufacturing environment experienced a slump.\n*   **Shamrock Environmental:** Company acquired by Republic Services at the start of the year, expected to contribute positively to earnings.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Executives plan to detail \"some credits\" to customers affected by labor disputes.\n*   Republic's Indianapolis Polymer Center is projected to reach commercial production in Q4.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Republic navigates economic headwinds, showing pricing power but facing labor and manufacturing challenges.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUpcoming negotiations in Geneva meant to finalize a global agreement to end plastic pollution will have important implications for recycling supply chains, business innovations and brands\u2019 voluntary plastic reduction commitments, said speakers during a Tuesday roundtable hosted by the Solid Waste Association of North America in Washington, D.C..\n\nSpeakers from WM, the Circular Action Alliance, SC Johnson and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they are closely monitoring the upcoming round of Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings that will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSome of these outcomes of INC-5.2 may impact plastic production, design and available end markets, which is really crucial,\u201d said Amy Lestition Burke, SWANA\u2019s CEO.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear just what direction this round of negotiations may take, Burke said waste and packaging stakeholders are watching for major movement on topics such as proposed extended producer responsibility models or proposed limits on overall plastic production. Those two facets could meaningfully shape recycling supply chains and influence brands\u2019 packaging design decisions, she said.\n\nThe Geneva negotiations are a continuation of a long-term discussion between global governments and stakeholders that started in 2022 and is meant to develop an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution. The goal was to complete the process by the end of 2024, but negotiators did not reach an agreement at what was supposed to be the final meeting in Busan, South Korea, in November.\n\nThough stakeholders from waste and packaging groups previously expressed frustration and disappointment that the negotiations have dragged into 2025, speakers at the SWANA event said a plastics treaty is nonetheless worth the time and effort.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can all agree on is that the waste and resource resource management industry is key to this, and it is a solution,\u201d Lestition Burke said.\n\nChuck Chaitovitz, vice president of environmental affairs and sustainability for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the ideal plastics treaty outcome would offer a \u201cglobal framework that drives country ambition\u201d while helping to provide \u201ceffective collection and reuse systems and end markets where we would have a circular economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber sent a letter in June to the U.S. State Department urging the federal government to continue participating in plastics treaty negotiations by advocating for an end to plastic pollution, but not an end to plastic use altogether. \u201cAn effective agreement would provide global economic opportunities,\u201d the Chamber wrote.\n\nA global plastics treaty must include investments in infrastructure that can boost recycling in both developed and developing countries, but those investments must also ensure long-term end markets for recycled materials, said Ganesh Nagarajan, senior director of plastics for WM.\n\n\u201cThese investments need to happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about having a framework or an agreement in place, but you need to really have those sustainable end markets behind it.\u201d\n\nBolstering end markets could help raise recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials such as plastic film and flexibles, he said. WM is currently working on some pilot programs to ramp up recycling for these materials, but is so far only recycling the materials customers are accidentally putting in their bins. \u201cOnly 2% is recycled today, so that's a large untapped opportunity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a robust and predictable end market\u201d before telling customers that such materials are allowed in curbside bins.\n\nMany global brands are already working on voluntary recycled content goals that are driving the market for recycled materials, said Jeff Bezzo, plastics sustainability leader at SC Johnson. But voluntary actions alone won\u2019t cut it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've made some great progress,\u201d Bezzo said, noting that 25% of the company's packaging globally is made with recycled content. \u201cWe'd like to do more. It is hard to be competitive when you're doing voluntary actions versus everybody rowing together in the same direction. That means the brand owners, the waste haulers, the reclaimers, all the way through the entire circle.\u201d\n\nSC Johnson is also a founding member of the Circular Action Alliance, the producer responsibility organization that manages extended producer responsibility programs for six U.S. states.\n\n\u201cWe see EPR as a key legislative tool to expand recycling, because most municipalities, let's face it, have stretched budgets,\u201d he said. Better funding mechanisms means more collection, better MRF infrastructure and more developed end markets, he said.\n\nBezzo sees EPR as an important tool for global treaty discussions, too. \u201cIn a global treaty, we'd love to see EPR as part of that design guideline, so manufacturers around the world have some certainty around what packaging they should be putting into the market, so it has its best chance to get recycled,\u201d he said.\n\nFor recycled content discussions, Bezzo said it\u2019s important for brands to see PCR content requirements \u201cratchet up over time.\u201d That would allow recycled plastics suppliers time to ensure they have viable end markets, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber recognizes that \u201cthere is a role to play for EPR in a global agreement,\u201d Chaitovitz said. However, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to consider these issues globally\u201d when U.S. stakeholders alone are still grappling with key aspects of EPR programs, such as PRO funding mechanisms and decisions about who gets to be in the PRO. \u201cAlso, we need to decide who gets the materials back, both those in the recycling space who want to recycle it, but then those brand owners and others that want to reuse that material to continue to make valuable products.\u201d\n\nFor WM, EPR could be an important driver as long as it has built-in demand drivers, such as minimum recycled content thresholds, Nagarajan said.\n\nPrevious INC meeting discussions included debates over whether to enforce virgin plastics production caps, and speakers at the SWANA event said they\u2019ll be watching to see what direction those discussions take in Geneva.\n\nBezzo said brands should already be reducing virgin demand. Such virgin reductions can be advanced by PCR requirements and other drivers like product lightweighting and reuse and refill programs.\n\nConsumers are already expressing an interest in products made with less plastic, Chaitovitz added, \u201cbut it's the market that needs to decide.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Global Plastic Treaty Talks Poised to Reshape Recycling Markets\n\n**Key details:**\nGlobal negotiations aimed at finalizing a legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution are set to resume in Geneva, Switzerland, from August 5-14. These upcoming Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5.2) meetings are expected to significantly impact recycling supply chains, business innovation, and brands' voluntary plastic reduction efforts. Industry stakeholders are closely watching for potential major developments regarding extended producer responsibility (EPR) models and proposed limits on overall plastic production. Speakers from WM, SC Johnson, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce emphasized the crucial nature of these discussions. The process, which began in 2022, missed its original 2024 completion goal.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe outcomes of these Geneva negotiations could fundamentally alter how plastic is produced, designed, and recycled, directly influencing packaging decisions for global brands. A global treaty is seen as crucial for driving necessary infrastructure investments to boost recycling rates and ensure robust long-term end markets for recycled materials. While some companies currently pursue voluntary recycled content goals, industry leaders suggest such actions alone are insufficient, calling for collective, possibly mandated, efforts. This perspective challenges a current industry consensus that voluntary corporate initiatives are enough to sustainably manage plastic waste and develop circular economies. The push for EPR as a legislative tool and potential virgin plastic production caps signals a shift toward more regulated, collective action.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe upcoming Geneva negotiations represent a continuation of a multi-year international effort to establish a global, legally binding agreement to combat plastic pollution. The overarching goal is to create a worldwide framework that fosters country ambition and facilitates effective collection, reuse, and end-market systems for a circular economy. Despite frustrations among stakeholders that negotiations have extended into 2025, the industry still views a comprehensive plastics treaty as a worthwhile endeavor. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce advocates for an agreement that eliminates plastic pollution but not plastic use, foreseeing global economic opportunities from such a framework.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Aug. 5-14:** Dates for the upcoming Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings in Geneva.\n*   **2024:** Original target year for completing the international plastics treaty agreement.\n*   **25%:** SC Johnson's global packaging made with recycled content.\n*   **2%:** Amount of plastic film and flexibles currently recycled by WM from accidental customer bins.\n*   **6:** Number of U.S. states where Circular Action Alliance manages extended producer responsibility programs.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA):** Hosted a roundtable discussing implications of upcoming global plastic treaty negotiations.\n*   **WM:** Closely monitoring negotiations, advocates for infrastructure investments and robust end markets for recycled materials.\n*   **Circular Action Alliance:** Monitors negotiations, manages extended producer responsibility programs in six U.S. states.\n*   **SC Johnson:** Monitors negotiations, works on voluntary recycled content goals, founding member of Circular Action Alliance.\n*   **U.S. Chamber of Commerce:** Closely monitoring negotiations, advocates for a global framework for economic opportunities.\n*   **Amy Lestition Burke:** SWANA's CEO, stated outcomes may impact plastic production, design, and end markets.\n*   **Ganesh Nagarajan:** WM Senior Director of Plastics, emphasized immediate investment in infrastructure and end markets.\n*   **Jeff Bezzo:** SC Johnson Plastics Sustainability Leader, discussed voluntary actions and the importance of EPR.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5.2) meetings will convene from August 5-14 in Geneva, Switzerland.\n*   Stakeholders will be observing for significant progress on proposed extended producer responsibility models and limits on overall plastic production.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nGlobal plastics treaty talks in Geneva are poised to drive mandatory changes for recycling and production.",
