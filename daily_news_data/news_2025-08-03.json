        "summary": "**Headline:** Manufacturing Contracts in July Amid Tariff Woes; Outlook Mixed\n\n**Key details:**\nThe manufacturing industry's contraction accelerated in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) registering 48%. Production rose to 51.4%, but this suggests higher prices due to ongoing tariff concerns. Supplier deliveries were faster in July, and the employment index fell, indicating cautious hiring despite increased production. However, new and backlog orders increased by 47.1% and 46.8% respectively, offering potential positive indications for the future. S&P's July PMI also showed a deterioration in operating conditions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe accelerating manufacturing contraction signals a challenging environment, reinforced by a significant GDP contraction to 79% in July, which is \"quite concerning.\" Tariffs are prompting companies to question sourcing strategies and consider passing higher costs to customers, indicating a broader impact on pricing and supply chains. This situation presents a mixed picture that challenges a purely negative industry consensus, as the increase in new and backlog orders suggests a future rebuild of inventories. Furthermore, U.S. manufacturers now anticipate greater stability from understood tariff conditions, which is considered a \"good thing.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe manufacturing sector is currently navigating persistent tariff concerns, which are causing companies to evaluate sourcing and potential cost increases for consumers. Industry health is measured by PMI, with readings below 50% indicating contraction. Companies previously saw customers stocking up on orders to get ahead of tariffs, leading to a rise in new and backlog orders. This suggests that once inventories are depleted, companies may return to their suppliers to restock. Manufacturers also believe that trade deals made by the Trump administration will contribute to more stable and predictable future conditions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM\u2019s July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index: 48%, down one percentage point from June.\n*   Manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted to 79% in July, from 46% in June.\n*   New orders increased by 47.1% and backlog orders by 46.8%.\n*   Employment index registered 43.4%, down 1.6 percentage points from June\u2019s 45%.\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI reported 49.8%, down from June\u2019s 52.9%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Reported the July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, indicating manufacturing industry contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, discussed tariff impacts on sourcing, costs, and future positive indicators.\n*   **S&P:** Published its July PMI report, reflecting similar numbers and deteriorating operating conditions.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist, commented on declining optimism and employment.\n*   **Trump administration:** Its trade deals are expected to create more stable and predictable conditions for manufacturers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing contracts amid tariffs, with mixed signals for future demand.",

        "title": "Ex-Flagstar CEO accused of illegal conduct",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Ex-Flagstar CEO Accused of Misconduct, Money Laundering in New Lawsuit\n\n**Key details:** A lawsuit filed by former Flagstar chief compliance officer Ross Marrazzo accuses former CEO Alessandro DiNello of significant misconduct. The complaint alleges DiNello was aware of client money laundering and urged Marrazzo to keep a flagged account open, potentially \"tipping\" the client. DiNello also allegedly discussed sensitive company transactions over a virtual conference while a \"junior employee sat on his lap.\" Marrazzo claims he was terminated to block his investigation into these matters.\n\n**Why it matters:** These allegations, brought by a former chief compliance officer, point to serious internal control and ethical failures at New York Community Bank, post-merger with Flagstar. The claims suggest potential executive interference in compliance investigations and a board that reportedly dismissed significant misconduct. This information could challenge any current perception of the bank's internal governance and commitment to regulatory compliance, especially given its recent struggles and acquisitions, by highlighting alleged high-level breaches.\n\n**The big picture:** Ross Marrazzo, a 40-year veteran in regulatory compliance, joined New York Community Bank (NYCB) which merged with Flagstar in 2022. NYCB acquired a large segment of the failed Signature Bank in March 2023. Alessandro DiNello, formerly Flagstar CEO, was installed as NYCB's CEO in March 2024 amidst the bank's financial problems, though his tenure was short. Marrazzo, who previously handled Signature Bank's regulatory issues, headed investigations involving DiNello before his termination.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* $2.7 billion: New York Community Bank bought a large segment of Signature Bank for this amount.\n* March 2023: Date NYCB acquired Signature Bank's segment.\n* $5 million: Amount Alessandro DiNello transferred to a millionaire.\n* $1.7 million: Amount DiNello received back in a related transfer.\n* 36 months: Ross Marrazzo's agreement term with the company.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* Alessandro DiNello: Former Flagstar CEO accused in lawsuit of alleged money laundering awareness and misconduct.\n* Ross Marrazzo: Former enterprise chief compliance officer who filed lawsuit after termination.\n* New York Community Bank (NYCB): Bank where alleged misconduct occurred; merged with Flagstar.\n* Flagstar: Bank whose name was adopted after merger with NYCB.\n* Signature Bank: Failed bank from which NYCB bought a large segment.\n* Joseph Otting: Took over as NYCB CEO after DiNello stepped down.\n* Liberty Capital: Acquired controlling interest in NYCB around time of stock offer.\n* Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom: Law firm involved in video meeting where nonpublic information was discussed.\n* Cravath, Swaine & Moore: Law firm that investigated the video meeting incident for the bank.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Eastern District of New York, will proceed.\n* Ross Marrazzo is seeking employment restoration and financial compensation.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New lawsuit alleges severe misconduct by ex-CEO, raising major compliance and governance flags.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Five Senior FDIC Officials Accused of Widespread Workplace Misconduct\n\n**Key details:**\nA report from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released Thursday found five senior Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) officials, including then-Chair Martin Gruenberg, engaged in workplace misconduct. The OIG's investigations developed evidence that each official personally engaged in some degree of inappropriate conduct. Allegations against Gruenberg included being short-tempered, making people cry, and dismissing a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 as a \"political attack.\" Other officials faced accusations ranging from belittling staff and leaving vitriolic voicemails to sexual harassment and retaliating against employees. As of June, none of the five officials identified in the report still worked at the FDIC.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe report's findings directly challenge the FDIC\u2019s stated core values, including accountability, fairness, and integrity. This information suggests that the actions of these senior officials did not protect victims of harassment, nor did they consistently align with FDIC policies. A previous OIG report also found FDIC employees perceived management was not effective in supporting harassment victims. The documented misconduct, including alleged retaliation and dismissal of internal concerns, could undermine public trust in the agency responsible for deposit insurance.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis OIG report represents the second part of a two-part investigation into the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture. The investigation was initiated following a November 2023 Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 alleging a \u201cboys\u2019 club environment\u201d that alienated women at the agency. The OIG stated that the evidence supported that certain actions of these senior officials did not protect victims of harassment. The previous OIG report also highlighted employee perceptions that management was ineffective in addressing workplace harassment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Five** Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials engaged in workplace misconduct.\n*   **Four** people alleged then-Chair Gruenberg made them cry.\n*   An employee received a **$105,000** payout following a complaint against Official 2.\n*   The OIG's investigation included a technology-assisted review of **280,448** FDIC documents.\n*   The OIG interviewed **69** current and former FDIC employees.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC):** A financial regulator whose senior officials were found to have engaged in workplace misconduct.\n*   **Office of the Inspector General (OIG):** Authored the report detailing widespread workplace misconduct at the FDIC.\n*   **Martin Gruenberg:** Then-Chair of the FDIC, identified for short-tempered behavior and seeing reports as political attacks.\n*   **Official 1:** A deputy chairman accused of belittling staff and driving employees to tears.\n*   **Official 2:** Allegedly left a vitriolic voicemail, leading to an employee complaint and significant payout.\n*   **Official 3:** Subject of detailed allegations concerning sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct in 2022 and 2023.\n*   **Official 4:** Accused of viewing opponents as disloyal and using his position to investigate them.\n*   **Wall Street Journal:** Published a November 2023 expos\u00e9 alleging a \u201cboys\u2019 club environment\u201d at the FDIC.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDamning report details widespread leadership misconduct, challenging FDIC's institutional integrity.",

        "title": "Frost CEO: Lending competition heating up",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Frost Bank Navigates Rising Texas Lending Competition, Eyes M&A Integration Gains\n\n**Key details:** Frost Bank is experiencing stiffer competition for lending activity in its Texas markets, particularly in the commercial real estate sector. Loans lost to other banks due to structure reached the second-highest quarter ever for Frost in the second quarter. This indicates competitors are offering more lenient loan structures, such as longer interest-only periods or terms. Despite this, Frost's average loans for Q2 increased 7.2% year-over-year to $21.1 billion, and losses to pricing dropped by 28%.\n\n**Why it matters:** The intensifying competition, especially in commercial real estate, suggests potential pressure on loan growth and profitability for banks operating in Texas. Frost's CEO Phil Green stated the bank will not make significant changes to its approach to credit structure, indicating a firm stance on credit quality despite aggressive competitor offerings. This challenges any potential consensus that Frost might compromise its lending standards to secure business. Furthermore, Frost perceives recent Texas M&A activity as beneficial, presenting an opportunity to gain customers and bankers from confused integrating entities.\n\n**The big picture:** Texas has become a significant hub for bank expansion and merger-and-acquisition activity, driven by the state's explosive population and business growth. Several regional and super-regional banks are actively acquiring local lenders or deepening their presence in the state. This heightened competition follows a period where many lenders had scaled back on commercial real estate due to past issues. Now, with fewer deals available, more participants are vying for opportunities.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$21.1 billion:** Frost Bank's average loans for the second quarter.\n*   **7.2%:** Year-over-year increase in Frost's average loans for Q2.\n*   **28%:** Drop in Frost Bank's losses to pricing.\n*   **$347.1 million:** Frost's non-interest expenses in Q2, a 9.5% jump.\n*   **$2.7 billion:** Deposits generated by Frost's expansion efforts since 2018.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Phil Green:** Frost Bank CEO, discussed stiff competition and the bank's strategy on the earnings call.\n*   **Dan Geddes:** Frost CFO, noted intensified competition for larger, high-quality loan opportunities.\n*   **Frost Bank:** San Antonio-based lender facing increased competition in Texas while pursuing organic expansion.\n*   **Huntington Bank:** Columbus, Ohio-based regional bank buying Dallas-based Veritex for $1.9 billion.\n*   **Glacier Bank:** Kalispell, Montana-based bank acquiring Mount Pleasant, Texas-based Guaranty Bancorp.\n*   **Prosperity Bancshares:** Houston-based company buying American Bank for $321.5 million.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Frost maintains credit discipline amid lending competition, leveraging M&A for organic growth.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Tech Job Growth Masks Sector Cuts, Broader Weakness Persists\n\n**Key details:**\nTechnology jobs across the economy increased by 54,000 in July, marking the second consecutive month of growth. However, employer postings for tech positions contracted slightly last month. Tech sector employment also saw a contraction of over 10,000 positions. Tech unemployment slightly rose to 2.9% in July from 2.8% the prior month. This occurred while national unemployment also increased to 4.2% from 4.1%.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe July increase in technology roles across the economy contrasts with flagging indicators in the broader U.S. employment market. This report challenges any consensus of steady job growth, as major downward revisions showed prior months' gains were largely nonexistent. It reveals an underlying weakness in the labor market. While tech jobs across the economy grew, the tech sector itself contracted, indicating a less robust picture for tech companies. This suggests the labor market is no longer a \"job-switcher's paradise.\"\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe data comes from a CompTIA analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data published recently. Employers are contending with economic uncertainty and a fluid global trade scenario. Previous months' seemingly steady jobs growth was significantly revised downwards, showing underlying weakness. Despite the overall growth in tech jobs across the economy, several technology providers have been trimming headcount. These recent layoffs are not fully reflected in the current report due to data lag.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   54,000: Technology jobs increased across the economy in July.\n*   2.9%: Tech unemployment rate in July.\n*   4.2%: National unemployment rate in July.\n*   More than 10,000: Tech sector employment contracted by this amount last month.\n*   More than 40%: Of active tech postings were added last month.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CompTIA**: Conducted the analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n*   **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: Source of the employment data analyzed by CompTIA.\n*   **Indeed**: Laura Ullrich, its director of economic research, commented on the market weakness.\n*   **Udemy**: Mischa Fisher, an economist, stated the market is no longer a job-switcher's paradise.\n*   **Microsoft**: Trimmed approximately 15,000 positions in two layoff rounds.\n*   **Intel**: Laid off over 5,000 last month, with plans for more cuts.\n*   **AWS**: Cut hundreds of positions, as reported in July.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Intel plans to cut nearly 25,000 positions by the end of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTech job growth masks sector cuts; broader market weakness persists.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Fluor reports project pauses and profit drops, stock plummets.\n\n**Key details:** Clients are now taking a \"wait-and-see\" approach, pausing projects due to trade policy, cost escalation, and interest rates. This includes project cancellations or extended deferments. Additionally, three older infrastructure jobs continue to hamstring Fluor's earnings. Work tied to energy construction also slowed significantly.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information challenges Fluor's previous report three months ago, which stated clients were \"forging ahead\" with projects despite headwinds; now, \"many are hitting pause.\" The shift in client behavior, coupled with ongoing issues on large infrastructure jobs and slowed energy work, severely impacted Q2 profits. This reversal suggests a deteriorating market environment and operational challenges.\n\n**The big picture:** Three months prior, Fluor reported clients were actively pursuing projects despite trade headwinds. However, client sentiment has since changed, with trade policy discussions significantly impacting their willingness to make long-term investment decisions. The company continues to experience \"pain from projects\" due to design errors, material escalation, and labor challenges on older jobs.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Company's stock cratered more than 27% following the news.\n*   Urban Solutions segment profits nosedived from $105 million to $29 million.\n*   Energy Solutions segment profit dropped about 80% to $15 million from $75 million a year ago.\n*   Backlog fell 13% to $28.2 billion from $32.3 billion a year ago.\n*   New awards dropped 43% year-over-year to $1.8 billion for the second quarter.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Fluor:** Engineering and construction company reporting Q2 earnings, seeing client project pauses and profit hits.\n*   **Jim Breuer:** Fluor CEO, discussed client hesitation, project challenges, and long-term opportunities.\n*   **NuScale:** Small modular nuclear reactor company, Fluor saw $3.2 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gains on its investment.\n*   **Baird:** Milwaukee-based financial services company, provided a research note on Fluor's Q2 results.\n*   **Andrew Wittmann:** Senior research analyst at Baird, commented on Fluor's \"tough\" results with \"weak orders, charges and delays.\"\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Client caution, project delays, and legacy issues hit Fluor's earnings.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Andrea Lucas confirmed at EEOC, signaling policy shift for employers.\n\n**Key details:** Andrea Lucas was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to a second term at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Her new term is set to expire on July 1, 2030. Lucas committed to enacting the \"bold civil rights agenda laid forth by President [Donald] Trump,\" emphasizing \"colorblind equality.\" She also stated that the EEOC is not an independent agency and would obey lawful presidential directives.\n\n**Why it matters:** Lucas's confirmation signals a significant shift in the EEOC's enforcement priorities, directly impacting how companies might approach diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The agency under Lucas has already issued documents targeting what it called \"unlawful\" DEI initiatives and moved to abandon litigation for transgender plaintiffs. Her stated position that the EEOC is not independent, and will follow presidential orders, challenges the traditional view of the agency as a neutral, autonomous enforcer of all civil rights laws, potentially altering compliance expectations and litigation risks for employers.\n\n**The big picture:** Lucas previously served as acting chair at the EEOC, despite the agency lacking a quorum due to President Trump's dismissal of two Democratic commissioners. During her confirmation hearing, Democratic lawmakers questioned her about the agency\u2019s independence from the White House. Lucas reversed her prior stance, affirming she would obey lawful directives from the president. The agency has also terminated leases at some field offices and faces at least one lawsuit alleging refusal to enforce federal workplace protections for transgender workers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Term expiration: July 1, 2030\n*   Columbia University settlement: $21 million\n*   EEOC settlement largest in: nearly 20 years\n*   Largest-ever EEOC settlement for victims of antisemitism\n*   Hamas attacks against Israel: Oct. 7, 2023\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Andrea Lucas: Confirmed to second EEOC term, will pursue Trump's civil rights agenda.\n*   U.S. Senate: Confirmed Andrea Lucas for a second term at the EEOC.\n*   U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): Agency where Lucas serves, handles civil rights enforcement.\n*   President Donald Trump: Lucas committed to enacting his civil rights agenda at the EEOC.\n*   Columbia University: Reached $21 million settlement with EEOC over civil rights allegations.\n*   Hamas: Attacks led to civil rights allegations resolved in EEOC settlement.\n*   Democratic lawmakers: Questioned Lucas during hearing about EEOC's independence.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Andrea Lucas's current term at the EEOC expires on July 1, 2030.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New EEOC leadership signals policy shift, impacting corporate employment practices.",

        "title": "Court shuts down bias claim from Christian ERG with biblical conduct requirement",
        "summary": "**Headline:** Appeals Court Sides with Sandia on Employee Group Discrimination Claim\n\n**Key details:** A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision favoring National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC. A Christian employee resource group (ERG) sued Sandia after its sponsorship was revoked. Sandia withdrew support due to the ERG's requirement that leaders attest to a \"Christian statement of faith,\" which conflicted with company policies. The appeals court affirmed the ERG failed to provide sufficient evidence or preserve arguments for its discrimination claims. This ruling stands even after the U.S. Supreme Court's *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, which lowered the standard for showing harm in Title VII cases.\n\n**Why it matters:** This ruling confirms a company's ability to enforce its nondiscrimination policies against employee groups, even when those groups cite religious grounds. It demonstrates that employers may prevail in discrimination lawsuits, even in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The outcome challenges the view that the *Muldrow* decision would automatically lead to an \"influx of discrimination claims\" against employers. Instead, it suggests that plaintiffs still face hurdles in providing sufficient evidence.\n\n**The big picture:** This case originates from a disagreement between a U.S. Department of Energy lab operator and one of its employee resource groups. At issue was the ERG's leadership criteria requiring adherence to a \"Christian statement of faith,\" which the employer deemed discriminatory. The lawsuit focused on religious discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The appeals court's review included considerations of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, which updated the standard for proving harm in discrimination claims.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   *: 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued its holding July 29.\n*   *: Lawsuit alleged discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n*   *: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 decision in *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* was part of the court's analysis.\n*   *: *Muldrow* changed the Title VII standard from \"significant\" harm to \"some\" harm.\n*   *: ERG was an \"improper plaintiff\" for First and Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC:** Lab operator that won the lawsuit against the employee resource group.\n*   **Christians in the Workplace Networking Group:** Employee resource group that sued Sandia over revoked sponsorship.\n*   **U.S. Department of Energy:** Entity for which Sandia operates as a lab operator.\n*   **10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals:** Court that affirmed the lower court's ruling in Sandia's favor.\n*   **U.S. Supreme Court:** Issued the *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* decision, referenced in the case.\n*   **Muldrow:** Plaintiff in a separate Supreme Court case influencing Title VII standards.\n*   **City of St. Louis:** Defendant in the Supreme Court case referenced by the appeals court.\n*   **HR Dive:** Media outlet mentioned for experts' opinions on *Muldrow* ruling.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Companies can enforce non-discrimination policies; lawsuits face high evidence hurdles.",

        "title": "EEOC alleges Mayo Clinic failed to accommodate religious exemption to COVID vaccine",
        "summary": "**Headline:** EEOC Sues Mayo Clinic Over Denied Religious Vaccine Exemption\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Mayo Clinic, alleging it illegally refused a security guard\u2019s religious COVID-19 vaccine exemption request. The guard, an Assemblies of God Church member, sought exemption in late 2021, citing beliefs and offering masking and testing. Mayo Clinic reportedly denied his request and threatened termination if he did not get vaccinated. The hospital declined comment, citing pending litigation.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit highlights that employers are still contending with failure-to-accommodate lawsuits despite less news about vaccine mandates. Such legal actions can result in \"hefty payouts,\" as exemplified by a $12.69 million jury award in a similar case. This challenges any perception that vaccine-related legal risks have subsided, showing ongoing financial and legal exposure for companies. Employers are advised to take religious accommodation requests seriously, especially after a Supreme Court ruling raised the bar for undue hardship claims.\n\n**The big picture:** While vaccine mandate news has significantly decreased, employers continue to face failure-to-accommodate lawsuits, often alleging religious rights violations. The EEOC consistently pursues these cases, having previously sued AG Equipment Co. and a Michigan-based hospital system over similar issues. One such case resulted in a $50,000 settlement. Legal experts warn employers to diligently address religious accommodation requests following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Groff v. DeJoy decision, which impacts employers' undue hardship claims.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Wednesday: Day the lawsuit against Mayo Clinic was filed.\n*   Late 2021: When the security guard submitted his vaccine exemption request.\n*   $50,000: Settlement in an April 2023 EEOC lawsuit against a Michigan hospital system.\n*   $12.69 million: Amount a Michigan jury initially awarded a former Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan employee.\n*   10: Number of workers allegedly fired by AG Equipment Co. in a prior EEOC lawsuit.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Mayo Clinic: Hospital system sued by EEOC for allegedly refusing a security guard's religious vaccine exemption.\n*   U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): Federal agency that filed the lawsuit against Mayo Clinic for alleged religious discrimination.\n*   Andrea Lucas: EEOC Acting Chair who stated employees have a right to reasonable religious accommodations.\n*   AG Equipment Co.: Manufacturer previously sued by EEOC for allegedly firing 10 workers over vaccine exemptions.\n*   Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan: Company that faced a large jury award in a past case involving a denied exemption.\n*   Assemblies of God Church: Religious affiliation of the security guard who sought the vaccine exemption.\n*   Christian Employers Alliance: Former president selected as chief of staff by EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The lawsuit against Mayo Clinic is currently pending litigation.\n*   A prior EEOC case against AG Equipment Co. is still working its way through the courts.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Employers face ongoing legal and financial risks from religious accommodation lawsuits.",

While states are reportedly making progress in promoting evidence-based reading, more effort is needed for all students to become skilled readers. Shayna Levitan, a policy analyst and author, emphasized students' right to learn with effective instructional materials. The report recommends six principles for states to advance equity in literacy development.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe EdTrust report's call for more action, despite reported state progress, challenges any consensus that current initiatives are fully addressing the literacy gap. This implies a continued need for policy shifts and resource allocation in education. For investors, this could signal ongoing demand for education technology or curriculum providers aligned with evolving evidence-based reading frameworks. U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon's focus on literacy further underscores this priority.\n\n**The big picture:**\nRecent disappointing reading proficiency, as measured by exams like the National Assessment of Educational Progress, has led many states to adopt evidence-based reading policies. These policies often include \"science of reading frameworks.\" U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has declared literacy education her No. 1 priority, reinforcing the national focus on improving student reading skills.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Most states had some type of law or policy addressing pre-K-12 literacy initiatives as of March 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **EdTrust:** Nonprofit that released a report on advancing equitable access to high-quality reading instruction.\n*   **Shayna Levitan:** P-12 policy analyst at EdTrust and author of the report on reading proficiency.\n*   **Council of Chief State School Officers:** Reported on the prevalence of state pre-K-12 literacy initiatives as of March 2024.\n*   **Linda McMahon:** U.S. Education Secretary, stated literacy education is her number one priority.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nStates must intensify efforts to achieve universal reading proficiency.",

        "summary": "**Manufacturing Contraction Accelerates Amid Tariff Concerns, Mixed Signals Emerge**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe manufacturing industry\u2019s contraction accelerated in July, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 48%. Supplier deliveries became faster, while the employment index declined. Despite the overall contraction, production rose, and new and backlog orders increased, which are considered positive future indicators as customers restock due to tariffs.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe accelerated contraction in manufacturing, highlighted by a PMI below 50%, signals ongoing industry challenges. Tariffs are pushing companies to rethink sourcing strategies and consider passing higher costs to customers, which could impact consumer prices. However, the reported increases in new and backlog orders, driven by customers stocking up, suggest a potential rebound in demand for inventories, challenging a purely negative outlook on the sector's immediate future.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTariffs remain a significant concern, leading to a questioning of sourcing strategies and opportunities for reshoring or nearshoring. Companies are also contemplating passing higher duty-related costs onto end customers, though this hasn't been widely observed yet. The manufacturing sector's gross domestic product contracted sharply in July, reaching a level described as \"quite concerning.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM PMI: 48% in July, down 1 percentage point from June.\n*   Production: 51.4%, up 1.1 percentage points from June.\n*   Supplier deliveries index: 49.3% in July, compared to 54.2% in June.\n*   Employment index: 43.4%, down 1.6 percentage points from June\u2019s 45%.\n*   Manufacturing GDP contracted to 79% in July, from 46% in June.\n*   New orders increased by 47.1%; backlog orders increased by 46.8%.\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI report: 49.8%, down from June\u2019s 52.9%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Released the July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index indicating accelerated manufacturing contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, commented on tariffs' impact on sourcing and companies considering cost pass-through.\n*   **S&P:** Published a July PMI report showing similar indicators and deteriorating operating conditions.\n*   **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** Employer of chief business economist Chris Williamson.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** Chief business economist, stated optimism took a knock due to demand and tariff concerns.\n*   **Trump administration:** Made trade deals, seen by U.S. manufacturers as leading to more stable conditions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing contracts, but tariff-driven order increases offer a glimmer of future rebuilding.",

        "title": "Stryker lowers expected tariff impact to $175M",
        "summary": "**Stryker slashes tariff impact, raises forecast on strong demand.**\n\n**Key details:** Stryker now anticipates a reduced $175 million tariff impact in 2025, down from a prior $200 million forecast. This adjustment follows a U.S.-China agreement to significantly reduce levies, though an EU trade deal set a higher tariff rate than initially modeled. The company also raised its full-year organic sales growth forecast to 9.5%-10% and increased adjusted earnings per share expectations by about 20 cents. Furthermore, Stryker provided an update on its Mako 4 robot, which has FDA clearance but is not yet globally launched, with new applications primarily on this system.\n\n**Why it matters:** The updated outlook, including reduced tariff impact and raised sales/earnings forecasts, challenges previous company projections and potentially market expectations for its future performance. This positive shift is driven by continued procedural strength, demand for capital equipment, and successful pandemic-era efficiency initiatives, suggesting robust underlying business health. Stryker\u2019s smaller tariff impact compared to some peers is attributed to its European manufacturing footprint and lesser presence in China.\n\n**The big picture:** Stryker joins several medical device companies, including Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, in reducing expected tariff hits due to new trade agreements. The company's raised financial forecast is supported by strong demand for implants and capital equipment. Margin improvements are also noted, stemming from pricing and manufacturing efficiency initiatives implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stryker recently achieved a milestone of 2 million robotic procedures performed with its Mako system.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $6 billion (11.1% increase year over year)\n*   Net income: $884 million (7.2% increase year over year)\n*   Expected 2025 tariff impact: $175 million (down from $200 million)\n*   New organic sales growth forecast: 9.5% to 10% (from 8.5% to 9.5%)\n*   Mako milestone: 2 million robotic procedures performed.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Stryker:** A medical device company reporting improved financial forecasts and reduced tariff impact expectations.\n*   **Johnson & Johnson:** A medical device firm also mentioned for cutting its expected tariff hit.\n*   **Boston Scientific:** Another medical device firm noted for slashing its expected tariff hit.\n*   **Preston Wells:** Stryker's CFO, who attributed tariff changes to U.S.-China levy reductions and discussed margin improvements.\n*   **Kevin Lobo:** Stryker's CEO, who commented on drivers for the raised forecast and Mako robot rollout status.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Global rollout of the Mako 4 robot.\n*   Full launch of the Mako shoulder surgery application, currently in limited release until next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Stryker's strong performance and tariff relief boost its financial outlook.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** At Home Closes More Stores Post-Bankruptcy Amid Home Goods Slump\n\n**Key details:**\nHome retailer At Home is closing six additional stores, according to a Friday press release from Hilco Consumer-Retail. These new closures span six states, including Illinois and New Jersey. This follows 26 locations previously announced for shuttering in June, with closing sales offering discounts up to 30% off. All sales on goods purchased on or after Friday are final, and At Home gift cards are accepted through August 14.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nAt Home's additional store closures highlight the continued struggles in the broader home goods category. The sector experienced a sharp downturn from its COVID-19 pandemic highs, facing months of sales declines. This trend challenges a potential view that the industry's recent \"upswing\" is broadly stabilizing all players. The liquidations demonstrate the severe impact on specific companies as consumers pull back on discretionary spending.\n\n**The big picture:**\nAt Home, which operated around 260 stores in 40 states, filed for bankruptcy in June with about $2 billion in debt. The company attributed its demise to factors including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and tariffs. This debt is part of a larger agreement involving $600 million in debtor-in-possession financing, with $200 million for restructuring. Other companies like Dollar General, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture, and Ikea are focusing on value or store growth amidst the category headwinds.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Six additional At Home stores are closing.\n* 26 At Home locations were announced to shutter in June.\n* Discounts of up to 30% off are offered during closing sales.\n* At Home operated about 260 stores across 40 states when it filed for bankruptcy.\n* The company filed with about $2 billion in debt.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* At Home: Home retailer closing additional stores after filing for bankruptcy in June.\n* Hilco Consumer-Retail: Firm retained to manage specific store closing sales for At Home.\n* Dollar General: Discount retailer that launched new home products in June.\n* Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture: Home furniture company that sought store growth this year.\n* Ikea: Furniture retailer that also sought store growth this year despite industry headwinds.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n* At Home gift cards, certificates, and rewards will be accepted through August 14 at closing stores.\n* Store closing sales will continue until all merchandise, fixtures, and equipment are sold.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** At Home's deeper closures underscore ongoing challenges in the home goods sector.",

While the employment index declined, production rose to 51.4%, suggesting a move towards raising prices due to ongoing tariff concerns. Supplier deliveries were faster, implying better supply chain performance amid sluggish demand. The manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted to 79% in July, a level not seen since December 2024. Conversely, new and backlog orders increased, which ISM views as a potential positive indicator for future U.S. manufacturing. S&P\u2019s July PMI also showed contraction at 49.8%, reflecting a \"deterioration in operating conditions.\"\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe overall contraction in manufacturing reported by both ISM and S&P challenges any consensus view of consistent or robust growth in the sector. Despite some positive indicators like increased new orders and production, the decline in employment and the high manufacturing GDP contraction signal underlying vulnerability. Companies considering passing tariff-induced higher costs to end customers suggest potential inflationary pressures for consumers. This creates a mixed and uncertain outlook for investors, as the industry grapples with the impact of tariffs while simultaneously showing signs of future demand.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTariffs are an ongoing concern for the manufacturing industry, prompting companies to question sourcing strategies and consider reshoring or nearshoring. Firms are actively discussing passing higher costs from duties onto their end customers. While supplier deliveries are faster, indicating better supply chain performance, it occurs amidst continued sluggish demand. However, the increase in new and backlog orders suggests customers stocked up due to tariff concerns, with expectations that inventories will now be rebuilt. Additionally, U.S. manufacturers interpret trade deals made by the Trump administration as leading to more stable and predictable future conditions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   ISM PMI in July: 48% (down one percentage point from June).\n*   Manufacturing sector\u2019s gross domestic product contracted in July to 79% (from 46% in June).\n*   New orders increased by 47.1% and backlog orders by 46.8%.\n*   Employment index registered 43.4% (down 1.6 percentage points from June).\n*   S&P\u2019s July PMI report: 49.8% (down from June\u2019s 52.9%).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Institute for Supply Management (ISM):** Released its July Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, reporting manufacturing industry contraction.\n*   **Thomas Derry:** ISM CEO, discussed tariffs' impact on company sourcing, costs, and positive future order indicators.\n*   **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** Published its July PMI report, which reflected a deterioration in operating conditions.\n*   **Chris Williamson:** Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, commented on S&P's findings and manufacturing optimism.\n*   **Trump administration:** Mentioned for trade deals that manufacturers believe will create more stable and predictable conditions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   ISM anticipates people will go back to their supply base to rebuild inventories after working them off, a potential positive for U.S. manufacturing.\n*   U.S. manufacturers expect more stable and predictable conditions from trade deals, despite ongoing tariffs.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nManufacturing faces tariff headwinds, showing contraction but mixed signals for future demand.",

Kennedy Jr. last month called Wednesday for an alternative to the panel from which they were ousted, arguing that the federal government has \u201cupended the U.S. vaccine policymaking process.\u201d\n\nThe former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which provides vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, made their call in a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cAn alternative to the Committee should be established quickly and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 independently from the federal government,\u201d they wrote.\n\nKennedy, who as head of the Department of Health and Human Serivces oversees the CDC, fired all existing ACIP members in June, replacing them with seven hand-picked successors, some of whom had previously made false claims about vaccines.\n\nHistorically, the committee has met several times per year to review clinical and epidemiological data, assess vaccine benefit and risk, and develop recommendations. The guidelines they put forward, if endorsed by the CDC, can form the basis of insurance coverage and influence health policy. Presentations made at these meetings are typically the product of months of research by working groups.\n\nIn the first meeting of the reformed committee, however, panelists heard from Lyn Redwood, president emeritus of the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense, who gave an unvetted presentation that initially contained at least one incorrect reference.\n\nAt that meeting, committee members sharply questioned evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of certain vaccines, and recommended the contested preservative thimerosal be removed from the few shots that still contain it.\n\n\u201cThe abrupt dismantling of the rigorously vetted process and the replacement of the Committee with an inexperienced and biased panel has engendered fundamental distrust in the Committee\u2019s vital work,\u201d the former ACIP members wrote in their editorial.\n\nThey laid out options for alternatives, including organizing a coalition of professional medical societies that could harmonize their vaccine recommendations or creating an external auditor to review guidelines put out by the reconstituted ACIP. An entirely separate, parallel system that follows past ACIP practices could also be stood up, although they cautioned that would take more resources.\n\nOne initiative, led by University of Minnesota professor Michael Osterholm, who leads an infectious disease center there, is trying something similar.\n\nKennedy has faced pushback for his actions from medical organizations as well as lawmakers. On Tuesday, Democrats on the Senate Health Committee launched an investigation into his remaking of ACIP. Kennedy has also been sued over vaccine policy changes made under his tenure as HHS secretary.\n\nJason Goldman, a liaison member to ACIP and a plaintiff in that suit, said in a recent interview that the changes \u201ccreate tremendous confusion and distrust\u201d in our public health.\n\n\u201cThe [ACIP] process has been hijacked with a very specific agenda to undermine the trust and faith in life-saving vaccines,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nACIP members, as well as other federal vaccine experts, were kept in the dark during Kennedy\u2019s changes to the committee. Stanley Perlman, member of a committee that consults with ACIP and a vaccine advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration, had told BioPharma Dive he heard of the dismissals from the news.\n\nBoth Goldman and Perlman said ACIP working groups did not meet as is typical prior to the most recent ACIP meeting.\n\nACIP isn\u2019t the only health panel that\u2019s been targeted by Kennedy. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal indicated he's considering replacing members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and, on Thursday, Jeremy Faust at Inside Medicine reported Kennedy has fired several members of a committee that supports the CDC director.",

The company received a complete response letter for its bispecific cancer antibody odronextamab in lymphoma on July 30, due to issues at an Indiana factory that Novo Nordisk recently acquired from Catalent. In addition, the FDA will delay a decision on an application for high-dose Eylea processed at that plant. The odronextamab setback will require Regeneron to refile its application. The FDA previously rejected another Regeneron bispecific antibody, now approved as Lynozyfic, in multiple myeloma because of third-party manufacturing issues. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAllogene Therapeutics is stopping use of an experimental immunosuppresive antibody called ALLO-647 following the death of a study participant, the company said Friday. ALLO-647 is part of a regimen meant to prepare patients for treatment with Allogene\u2019s donor-derived cell therapy for blood cancer, cema-cel. But the antibody has been associated in rare cases with severe viral infections and, in this instance, was deemed related to an adenovirus infection that triggered liver failure in a participant in Allogene\u2019s pivotal trial. Allogene has closed the study arm with ALLO-647 and won\u2019t use it in future trials. It will move forward with a standard two-drug immunosuppressive regimen often used in cancer cell therapy. Results from the pivotal trial are still expected next year, the company said. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nBristol Myers Squibb boosted its revenue outlook for 2025 by $700 million, driven by higher-than-expected sales of its off-patent cancer drug Revlimid. The company now expects full-year sales to be between $46.5 and $47.5 billion, although that may not flow through to the bottom line because of the $1.5 billion it has spent this year to license a BioNTech cancer drug. The unexpectedly high $838 million in Revlimid sales in the second quarter were part of a broader overperformance by the company, which beat Wall Street consensus for both its old and new drug business lines. Sales of Eliquis, Opdivo and Reblozyl were higher than expected, although cell therapy Abecma and new psoriasis drug Sotyktu were below, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nBiogen shares rose as much as 7% Thursday after the biotechnology company\u2019s latest earnings report surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company recorded $2.6 billion in revenue from April through the end of June, with $160 million coming from Leqembi, its closely watched drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Biogen also raised its forecasts for 2025 revenue and earnings per share. To Brian Abrahams, an analyst at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, the results were indicative that Biogen\u2019s efforts to turn around the business are starting to show. \u201cWe see considerable room for upside,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nShares of Argenx climbed by double digits following quarterly sales numbers for its autoimmune drug Vyvgart that handily topped investor expectations. According to Argenx, the company\u2019s multiple Vyvgart formulations combined to generate nearly $949 million in revenue between April and June, beating consensus estimates by more than $80 million. The \u201cblowout\u201d performance included \u201cimpressive\u201d numbers across Vyvgart\u2019s approved indications and different versions, wrote William Blair analyst Myles Minter on Thursday. Leerink Partners\u2019 Thomas Smith now projects more than $9 billion in combined peak yearly sales. Argenx\u2019s market value rose past $40 billion on the news. \u2014 Ben Fidler",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nSales of an Alnylam Pharmaceuticals rare disease medicine substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations in the drug\u2019s first full quarter since U.S. regulators expanded its use, lifting the biotechnology company\u2019s market value to new highs on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Alnylam, sales of the drug, called Amvuttra and sold for two types of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR, reached $492 million between April and June, well above consensus estimates of about $350 million. About $150 million of that total was attributed to patients with the \u201ccardiomyopathy\u201d form of the disease that regulators cleared Amvuttra for in March. Some 1,400 people were on therapy at the end of the quarter, Alnylam said.\n\nAlnylam also hiked its 2025 financial projections by hundreds of millions of dollars, guiding between $2.18 billion and $2.28 billion in net revenue from Amvuttra and Onpattro, its other transthyretin amyloidosis drug, compared to the previous $1.6 billion to $1.73 billion range. Alnylam now expects $2.65 billion to $2.8 billion in total net revenues. Company shares climbed by more than 15%, taking Alnylam\u2019s market value past $50 billion.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAlnylam has for years been among biotech\u2019s most valuable companies. But it has never been consistently profitable, and is banking on Amvuttra to change that.\n\nA March expansion into ATTR cardiomyopathy, a progressive condition that causes heart failure, hospitalizations and death, was a vital step. ATTR cardiomyopathy is believed to be more common than the \u201cpolyneuropathy\u201d form Amvuttra was first cleared to treat in 2022. Sales of the leading cardiomyopathy treatment, Pfizer\u2019s tafamidis, topped $5 billion last year.\n\nAmvuttra, an injectable medicine, competes with Pfizer\u2019s drug and BridgeBio Pharma\u2019s Attruby, both of which are taken orally. Attruby reached market earlier and is also off to a faster-than-expected start.\n\nAlnylam priced Amvuttra in cardiomyopathy at $476,000 per year, a significant premium to its rivals, despite the fact clinical results didn\u2019t appear strong enough to indicate its drug is clearly superior.\n\nAlnylam executives have said they expect Amvuttra to grow the market for ATTR cardiomyopathy medicines, as most patients still aren\u2019t on treatment. They\u2019ve also expressed confidence Amvuttra could become a standard option. The drug works differently than its competitors and, because it\u2019s only injected four times a year, could have better adherence, they\u2019ve said.\n\nSo far, its optimistic projections appear to be playing out. On a conference call Thursday, some analysts questioned whether the better-than-expected numbers were driven by a surge of initial prescriptions for sicker people whose disease had been progressing on other medicines. CEO Yvonne Greenstreet said the company is seeing \u201cbroad uptake\u201d that includes newly diagnosed patients as well.\n\nChief Commercial Officer Tolga Tanguler added many commercial and Medicare insurers already have policies out and are clearing use in newly diagnosed patients, indicating they aren\u2019t requiring people take Pfizer or BridgeBio\u2019s drugs first. A month into the quarter, Alnylam began to see a \u201cvery healthy and accelerating trend in first-line use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results are \u201cnot just a flash in the pan,\u201d Greenstreet added. \u201cWe expect continuous, sustainable growth,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing the call, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a research note the higher guidance still \u201clooks beatable\u201d and raised his projections for Amvuttra\u2019s peak annual sales to $9 billion, up from about $7 billion previously.\n\nAlnylam intends to gradually lower Amvuttra\u2019s net price through rebates and pay-for-performance deals as patient uptake increases. On Thursday\u2019s call, CFO Jeff Poulton said to expect a \u201cmid-single digit reduction in net price\u201d this year.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Alnylam Shares Surge as Amvuttra Sales Blast Past Expectations\n\n**Key details:** Alnylam's rare disease drug Amvuttra saw sales reach $492 million between April and June, significantly exceeding Wall Street's consensus estimate of $350 million. Approximately $150 million of this total came from patients with the cardiomyopathy form of the disease, with 1,400 people on therapy. The company also substantially hiked its 2025 financial projections for Amvuttra and Onpattro to $2.18 billion-$2.28 billion, up from a prior range of $1.6 billion-$1.73 billion. Alnylam now expects total net revenues of $2.65 billion-$2.8 billion for 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:** Alnylam has historically not been consistently profitable, and Amvuttra is crucial to achieving this goal. The strong sales performance, driven by \"broad uptake\" including newly diagnosed patients and insurer clearance for first-line use, challenges previous market assumptions that growth might be limited or require prior use of competitor drugs. This suggests Amvuttra is rapidly penetrating the ATTR cardiomyopathy market, and could expand the overall market faster than anticipated. A Stifel analyst raised peak annual sales projections for Amvuttra to $9 billion, indicating higher confidence in its long-term potential.\n\n**The big picture:** Alnylam has long been among the most valuable biotech companies. Amvuttra treats transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a condition that causes heart failure, with its use expanded to the more common cardiomyopathy form in March. Amvuttra, an injectable, competes with oral drugs like Pfizer's tafamidis and BridgeBio Pharma's Attruby. Alnylam believes Amvuttra will grow the overall market for ATTR cardiomyopathy medicines, as most patients remain untreated.

        "summary_text": "Biotechnology companies specializing in psychedelics research saw their share prices rise after rumors of a billion-dollar acquisition hinted that big pharma is now more open to betting on this area of drug development.\n\nBloomberg News reported early Thursday that AbbVie is in talks to buy privately held Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals. If agreed to, the deal would hand AbbVie a small slate of experimental therapies for depression, anxiety and mental health conditions. Gilgamesh\u2019s most advanced drug, code-named GM-2505, works by latching onto a brain protein known to interact with psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin.\n\nGilgamesh\u2019s possible takeover appears to have buoyed investor confidence in psychedelics companies. Shares of Cybin, Mind Medicine and GH Research \u2014 which are respectively advancing their own versions of psilocybin, LSD, and a psychoactive compound found in certain plants and toads \u2014 were up about 3% to 5% by mid-morning Thursday.\n\nTwo other biotechs, Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways, had gains of more than 10%, though Compass\u2019 later dwindled.\n\nJoshua Schimmer, an analyst at the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, said he\u2019s not surprised to see big pharma taking more interest in psychedelics, since these therapies have shown \u201ctransformational\u201d potential across a range of mental health disorders. Compass, for one, in June announced results from a late-stage clinical trial wherein a single dose of its psilocybin therapy significantly reduced symptoms of treatment-resistant depression.\n\nGilgamesh also recently disclosed positive results from a study of GM-2505, which, according to the company, was able to quickly, effectively and durably treat the most common form of depression.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important waves of innovation we're seeing today in biotech,\u201d Schimmer said. \u201cWe need more clinical data readouts in proper, large, randomized, controlled trials. But so far, we're seeing things we've really not seen before in psychiatric care, and it doesn't end with depression.\u201d\n\nAnalysts note, too, the inroads psychedelics are making with drug regulators. Martin Makary, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, both support speeding up the testing \u2014 and possible approval \u2014 of psychedelics. The FDA, under former president Joe Biden, also issued guidance in 2023 for psychedelic drug developers.\n\n\u201cThe macro backdrop continues to improve,\u201d wrote Jefferies analyst Andrew Tsai in a note to clients. Tsai added that a Gilgamesh purchase, should it happen under the alleged terms, would be larger than previous deals for these kinds of assets. That could help assure Wall Street that psychedelics are \u201can investable space.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, concerns raised by last year's flame-out of one of the field's leading players, Lykos Therapeutics, have since eased. Analysts now see the problems that company encountered in its attempt to win approval of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as unique.\n\nWhile those tailwinds can help catalyze bigger-ticket acquisitions, there are reasons to believe such deals won\u2019t come easily. For instance, many of the deepest-pocketed drug firms have found neuroscience too risky and backed away from it over the years. That aversion, if it persists, could keep the pool of potential buyers narrow.\n\nPsychedelic developers may also not be so keen to come to the negotiating table, especially since medium-sized companies like Intra-Cellular Therapies, Axsome Therapeutics and Acadia Pharmaceuticals have demonstrated that brain drugs can be successfully commercialized without big pharma resources.\n\nMany of the current crop of psychedelics biotechs have \u201cvery strong management teams\u201d with considerable experience selling medicines, Schimmer said. \u201cI don't see why you need a large pharma company to get this done.\u201d\n\nKabir Nath, CEO of Compass, told BioPharma Dive this week that his team isn\u2019t designing the company to be sold. The focus, rather, is getting Compass\u2019 psilocybin therapy through the final stages of testing and onto the market.\n\n\u201cIt's very exciting to see the resurgence of interest in psychiatry in general, from big pharma and so on,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe can't expect to be bought or partnered.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any board, if somebody comes knocking at the right point, we'll have the discussion,\u201d Nath added. \u201cThe door is not closed.\u201d\n\nAbbVie has been more active than many of its peers inking deals that revolve around the brain. In late 2023, the company agreed to spend almost $9 billion to take control of Cerevel Therapeutics and a once-promising schizophrenia therapy.\n\nSince then it dropped $1.4 billion on a Johnson & Johnson-backed startup built around a type of brain drug technology. Then, a couple months ago, it took a $355 million stake in a biotech developing genetic medicines for neurological disorders, among other diseases.\n\nA Gilgamesh acquisition would further diversify the company\u2019s neuroscience research while thrusting it into a field few other large pharmaceutical firms have felt comfortable dedicating significant resources to. J&J is the main exception there. It already sells Spravato, a form of ketamine that\u2019s used to treat depression and last year generated more than $1 billion.\n\nJ&J also this spring closed its $15 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular, providing access to a lucrative, mind-stabilizing drug called Caplyta as well as a series of experimental, non-hallucinogenic psychedelics.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets, in a report published last week, argued the psychedelic space is \u201capproaching a tipping point\u201d as late-stage readouts near and Spravato gets on track to deliver $2 billion in yearly sales. Spravato has \u201cincreasingly validated the market,\u201d according to the report.\n\nGavin Clark-Gartner, an analyst at Evercore ISI, agrees the Spravato story has been a major force toward de-risking psychedelic drug research. However, he cautions that the biotechs coming up in the space will likely have to build upon the commercial infrastructure J&J laid.\n\n\u201cIt is not necessarily flipping a switch and a one-for-one translation from Spravato to a lot of these other therapies,\u201d he said.",

A deal of this potential magnitude, larger than previous ones in the space, could help assure Wall Street that psychedelics are \"an investable space.\" This suggests a turning point, with past concerns like Lykos Therapeutics' difficulties now viewed as unique to that company. The success of Johnson & Johnson's Spravato, generating over $1 billion in sales last year, further validates the market and potentially lowers perceived investment risk.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe biotechnology sector focused on psychedelics research is experiencing renewed investor interest due to the \"transformational\" potential of these therapies for mental health disorders. This surge follows recent positive clinical data, such as Compass Pathways' late-stage trial showing significant reduction in treatment-resistant depression symptoms. Regulatory bodies like the FDA are increasingly supportive, with key officials advocating for expedited testing and approval of psychedelic drugs. While many large drug firms historically avoided neuroscience due to risk, companies like AbbVie and J&J are now making significant investments. However, some psychedelic developers, citing successful independent commercialization by medium-sized firms, may be hesitant to be acquired.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   AbbVie's potential acquisition of Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals is rumored to be a billion-dollar deal.\n*   Shares of Cybin, Mind Medicine, and GH Research were up about 3% to 5% by mid-morning Thursday.\n*   Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways saw gains of more than 10%.\n*   Johnson & Johnson's Spravato generated over $1 billion last year and is on track for $2 billion in yearly sales.\n*   AbbVie agreed to spend almost $9 billion to take control of Cerevel Therapeutics in late 2023.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **AbbVie:** Large pharmaceutical company reportedly in talks to acquire privately held Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals for a billion.\n*   **Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals:** Privately held company rumored to be acquired by AbbVie for its experimental therapies.\n*   **Bloomberg News:** Reported early Thursday about AbbVie's potential billion-dollar acquisition of Gilgamesh.\n*   **Cybin:** Psychedelics biotech firm whose shares rose 3-5% following Gilgamesh acquisition rumors.\n*   **Mind Medicine:** Psychedelics biotech firm advancing LSD, with shares up after acquisition rumors.\n*   **GH Research:** Psychedelics biotech firm whose shares rose 3-5% following the acquisition rumors.\n*   **Atai Life Sciences:** Biotech company that saw gains exceeding 10% after the acquisition rumors.\n*   **Compass Pathways:** Biotech with significant gains, later dwindling, and positive late-stage trial results.\n*   **Joshua Schimmer:** Cantor Fitzgerald analyst seeing \"transformational\" potential in psychedelics, strong management teams.\n*   **Food and Drug Administration (FDA):** Regulator issuing guidance and with officials supporting faster psychedelic drug approvals.\n*   **Johnson & Johnson (J&J):** Sells Spravato, acquired Intra-Cellular, significant investor in brain-related drugs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for potential confirmation or agreement on AbbVie's rumored acquisition of Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals.\n*   Monitor upcoming late-stage clinical data readouts from psychedelic drug developers.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nBig pharma's interest in psychedelics grows, potentially validating the investable market.",

        "summary_text": "Moderna said Thursday it plans to lay off 10% of its workforce, or more than 800 employees, as part of an ongoing effort to cut expenses amid slowing vaccine sales.\n\nModerna first announced last September a plan to lower $1.5 billion in annual operating expenses by 2027, largely by trimming research spending. The company planned to hit that mark without cutting into its workforce, with a spokesperson at the time calling the restructuring a \u201cfinancial change\u201d that wouldn\u2019t involve layoffs.\n\nIn a Thursday memo to employees, CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that the company has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d towards that goal, in part by renegotiating supply deals and lowering manufacturing costs. But while \u201cevery effort was made to avoid affecting jobs,\u201d the company now has to reduce its headcount, too. Bancel didn\u2019t detail which types of roles will be affected, but revealed the company\u2019s global workforce \u2014 which totaled more than 5,800 people in 18 countries at the end of last year \u2014 will be cut to less than 5,000.\n\n\"Reshaping our operating structure and aligning our cost structure to the realities of our business are essential to remain focused and financially disciplined, while continuing to invest in our science on the path to 2027,\u201d Bancel wrote.\n\nModerna rose to stardom during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing one of the first coronavirus shots to market and earning billions of dollars in product sales as a result. But its financial fortunes have reversed since then due to declining demand for COVID-19 shots and slow uptake for an RSV vaccine it\u2019s also brought to market. Moderna has revised its revenue guidance multiple times amid the slowdown, too, eroding confidence in its management team and leading analysts to long expect expense cuts and layoffs.\n\nThe job cuts announced Thursday are \u201cnecessary to right-size the company\u2019s operational footprint to offset continued vaccine revenue decline,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Mani Foroohar wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe change in U.S. public health leadership this year has hurt Moderna, too. The Food and Drug Administration has implemented a stricter approval framework for COVID shots that\u2019s resulted in narrower-than-expected clearances. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also recast an influential vaccine committee with some members skeptical of the messenger RNA shots Moderna is known for. HHS terminated a contract with Moderna to develop mRNA vaccines for bird flu as well.\n\nModerna is counting on newer shots it\u2019s developing \u2014 among them a cancer vaccine being co-developed with Merck & Co. and a combination COVID and influenza vaccine \u2014 to help change its outlook.\n\n\u201cOur mission remains unchanged. With three approved products and the potential for up to eight more approvals in the next three years, the future of Moderna is bright. We are sharpening our focus, becoming leaner, and staying ambitious in oncology, rare diseases and latent viruses,\u201d Bancel said in the memo.\n\nModerna will report its latest quarterly results on Friday.",

This decision is part of ongoing efforts to reduce expenses as vaccine sales slow. The company's global workforce, totaling over 5,800 people last year, will be reduced to less than 5,000. While previous plans aimed to lower operating expenses by trimming research spending without layoffs, CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel stated headcount reduction is now necessary despite prior efforts to avoid it.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis layoff announcement signals a more significant cost-cutting measure than previously communicated, as the company initially aimed to avoid workforce reductions. It underscores the severity of declining demand for COVID-19 shots and slow uptake for its RSV vaccine, forcing a \"right-size\" of its operations. The explicit decision to cut jobs, despite earlier assurances that restructuring would not involve layoffs, challenges the previous company stance and confirms an eroding confidence in its management team, a sentiment analysts have long noted.\n\n**The big picture:**\nModerna rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, generating billions from its coronavirus vaccine. However, its financial fortunes have since reversed due to decreased demand for its COVID-19 and slow-selling RSV vaccines. The company has also been impacted by changes in U.S. public health leadership, including stricter FDA approval frameworks and the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department terminating a bird flu vaccine contract.

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s popular diabetes drug Mounjaro proved about as effective as its older medicine Trulicity in protecting heart health in the largest and longest clinical trial of the newer GLP-1 therapy to date.\n\nAccording to summary results released by Lilly Thursday, Mounjaro met the main goal of the head-to-head study, which enrolled more than 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and heart disease and ran for nearly five years.\n\nWhile Mounjaro\u2019s benefit wasn\u2019t great enough for researchers to declare it superior to Trulicity, the rate of all-cause mortality was 16% lower for the newer drug, which in addition to stimulating the GLP-1 hormone receptor like Trulicity, also activates another known as GIP.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTirzepatide, the active ingredient contained in Mounjaro and Zepbound, which Lilly sells for weight loss, has fast become one of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s fast-selling medicines. Already, it\u2019s entrenched as a go-to option for treating Type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\nStudies like the one Lilly top-lined Thursday are meant to build on that dominance by proving out the tantalizing signals indicating tirzepatide can have powerful effects on a range of chronic illnesses. Already, Lilly has shown with Phase 3 trial data that tirzepatide can lower heart failure risk, ease obstructive sleep apnea and reduce the chances of developing diabetes.\n\nThe results released Thursday are particularly vital to Lilly\u2019s plans, given the interplay between diabetes, obesity and heart risk. The company said it would share the data with regulators, potentially supporting its addition to Mounjaro\u2019s labeling, which could help improve insurance coverage and encourage prescribing.\n\nCalled Surpass-CVOT, the trial pitted Mounjaro against Trulicity on an endpoint known as MACE-3, which tracks the time until first occurrence of either a stroke, heart attack or cardiovascular-related death. On that measure, data showed treatment with Mounjaro led to an 8% lower rate than did Trulicity, enough to statistically prove \u201cnon-inferiority\u201d but not superiority.\n\n\u201cAlthough we would have rather seen tirzepatide demonstrate statistically significant superiority on the primary endpoint, we see the results as supportive of tirzepatide continuing to be preferred by physicians and patients over other GLP-1s, including Trulicity,\u201d wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger in a Thursday note to clients.\n\nOther secondary measures also supported Mounjaro\u2019s benefit. Clinical trial participants who received it on average experienced better kidney function and blood sugar control, although Lilly did not adjust the data for testing multiple hypotheses.\n\nPeople on Mounjaro also experienced substantially greater improvements in weight, losing on average about 25 pounds at three years compared to about 10 pounds for those on Trulicity.\n\nLilly also compared data from Surpass-CVOT to an earlier study called Rewind that tested Trulicity against placebo and found the older GLP-1 drug reduced MACE-3 risk by about 12%. By statistically matching patients who received Mounjaro in Surpass-CVOT to those given placebo in Rewind, Lilly researchers estimated Mounjaro\u2019s risk reduction versus placebo at 28% on MACE-3 and 39% on all-cause mortality.\n\nSide effects were mainly gastrointestinal and generally ranged from mild to moderate in severity, Lilly said. However, slightly more participants on Mounjaro, about 13%, discontinued due to side effects than the roughly 10% in the group that received Trulicity.\n\nSurpass-CVOT examined Mounjaro\u2019s heart benefit in people who had diabetes; Lilly has another study, dubbed Surmount-MMO, that\u2019s testing whether Zepbound can reduce broader morbidity and mortality risk in people with obesity and heart disease.\n\nSuccess should help Lilly compete with Novo Nordisk\u2019s competing GLP-1 drug semaglutide, which the Danish drugmaker sells as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. Novo already has proven Wegovy provides heart benefits in people with obesity, which has helped it secure favorable insurance coverage.\n\nBut Zepbound\u2019s greater weight loss benefit appears to be winning out in the market, as Lilly has made gains against Novo. On Wednesday, Novo trimmed down its sales forecasts for the year, citing, among other things, increased competition.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Mounjaro Matches Older Drug on Heart Health, Bolstering Lilly's Lead.\n\n**Key details:** Eli Lilly's Mounjaro met the primary goal of its largest clinical trial, Surpass-CVOT, proving non-inferiority to its older drug, Trulicity, in protecting heart health. Mounjaro led to an 8% lower rate of major cardiovascular events (MACE-3) compared to Trulicity, though it did not achieve statistical superiority. The new drug also showed a 16% lower rate of all-cause mortality and significantly greater weight loss, with participants losing about 25 pounds on average. Other benefits included improved kidney function and blood sugar control.\n\n**Why it matters:** These results are vital for Lilly's strategy, aiming to strengthen Mounjaro's market position given the link between diabetes, obesity, and heart risk. They could support expanded labeling, potentially improving insurance coverage and boosting prescriptions. While Mounjaro did not prove superior to Trulicity on the primary endpoint, the non-inferiority finding, coupled with other benefits, challenges any potential consensus expecting a superior outcome and solidifies its competitive stance against rivals like Novo Nordisk, which already has heart benefit proof for Wegovy. This data helps Lilly compete more effectively in the lucrative GLP-1 market where Novo Nordisk recently trimmed sales forecasts citing increased competition.\n\n**The big picture:** Mounjaro, containing the active ingredient tirzepatide, has rapidly become a top-selling medicine for Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Tirzepatide uniquely activates both GLP-1 and GIP hormone receptors, unlike older drugs like Trulicity. Lilly is conducting studies to further prove tirzepatide's effects on various chronic illnesses, having already shown it can lower heart failure risk and ease sleep apnea. The pharmaceutical industry's GLP-1 market is highly competitive, with Lilly aiming to strengthen its position against rival products like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   More than 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and heart disease enrolled in the trial.\n*   The trial ran for nearly five years.\n*   Mounjaro led to an 8% lower MACE-3 rate compared to Trulicity.\n*   All-cause mortality was 16% lower for Mounjaro.\n*   Mounjaro users lost about 25 pounds on average at three years, compared to 10 pounds for Trulicity users.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Eli Lilly:** Developed Mounjaro and Zepbound; released new heart health trial results for Mounjaro.\n*   **Leerink Partners:** Investment firm whose analyst commented on Mounjaro's trial data.\n*   **David Risinger:** Leerink Partners analyst who believes Mounjaro will remain preferred by physicians.\n*   **Novo Nordisk:** Key competitor in the GLP-1 market, recently trimmed sales forecasts citing increased competition.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Lilly will share the Surpass-CVOT trial data with regulators, potentially leading to labeling additions for Mounjaro.\n*   Watch for results from Lilly's Surmount-MMO study on Zepbound's impact on morbidity and mortality in obese individuals with heart disease.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** The heart data solidifies Mounjaro's market position against rising GLP-1 competition.",

The deal offers CSPC potentially $2 billion in additional payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Madrigal executives said they plan on combining the CSPC drug, called SYH2086, with the company\u2019s MASH drug Rezdiffra in a once-daily pill. They envision treatment could combine the benefits of weight loss from a GLP-1 pill with the antifibrotic and fat reducing qualities of Rezdiffra to give people with MASH additional disease control. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nKissei Pharmaceutical is paying $70 million upfront and offering up to $315 million in milestone payments to Viridian Therapeutics for Japanese rights to two antibody drugs for thyroid eye disease. Viridian has already announced positive Phase 3 study data for the most advanced drug in the deal, called veligrotug. The second, called VRDN-003, is in ongoing Phase 3 testing. The company hopes to compete with Amgen\u2019s marketed drug for thyroid eye disease, Tepezza, by offering a more convenient dosing regimen.\u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved broader use of Apellis Pharmaceuticals\u2019 rare disease drug Empaveli, clearing it for the kidney diseases C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in people 12 years of age or older. In testing, treatment with Empaveli reduced urine protein levels by significantly more than placebo and stabilized kidney function. Earlier this year, Novartis won FDA approval of its drug Fabhalta for use in adults with C3G. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nPeople with the rare disease phenylketonuria, or PKU, have a new treatment option after the FDA on Monday approved the drug Sephience from PTC Therapeutics. In a statement, the company highlighted what it described as a broad label that includes all disease subtypes in people who are 1 month of age or older. News of the approval sent shares in PTC higher by nearly 10% this week. The company is also awaiting agency decisions on drugs for Friedrich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals said Monday that it had earned a $100 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics under their research alliance, after meeting a patient enrollment target in a Phase 1/2 trial of its treatment for myotonic muscular dystrophy. Such fees are part of the normal course of business in biotech, but payment by Sarepta had suddenly become in doubt after the company\u2019s standoff with the FDA over whether it could continue selling its gene therapy Elevidys. The Duchenne treatment is vital to Sarepta\u2019s financial future, so the prospect of it being removed from market sparked concerns Sarepta might reach a point when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations. That risk appears to have receded for now, after the FDA relented Tuesday. Arrowhead expects to receive the $100 million within 60 days. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStellantis\u2019 North American subsidiary FCA US has recalled over 121,000 Jeep models for second-row head restraints that may not lock in the upright position, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .\n\nThe recall covers 2023-2024 Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L SUVs built from May 2023 through Jan. 30, 2024. Similar models built before and after use a different part and are not included in the recall, per the report.\n\nStellantis dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the second-row head restraints, if necessary. The automaker will begin notifying customers on Sept. 5.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe second-row seat head restraints in the SUVs are designed to automatically fold forward when the rear seats are lowered flat for additional cargo capacity. But when the seats are returned to their normal position, the head restraints may not lock back into the upright position, according to the recall report.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization began investigating the problem on Aug. 13, 2024 after receiving reports from customers of head restraints not locking properly.\n\nFrom August 2024 through May, the company\u2019s compliance team met with engineering and manufacturing personnel to identify the problem and determine the number of affected vehicles. The investigation also included a review of customer records.\n\nOn June 11, the automaker\u2019s safety team identified a \u201cvehicle build issue\u201d in some Cherokee models that may stop second-row head restraints from locking in the upright position.\n\nOn July 10, its Vehicle Regulations Committee determined that the problem may affect all vehicles and violates Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Therefore, the automaker elected to conduct a voluntary recall to address the concern.\n\nCurrent FMVSS require that head restraints in all vehicles sold in the U.S. not be below 750 millimeters in height from the seat bottom to reduce whiplash injuries in a crash.\n\nThe head restraints were sourced from Grammer Americas and were manufactured at a production facility in Plymouth Township, Michigan. Grammer Americas is the U.S. subsidiary of Germany-based Tier 1 supplier Grammer Industries. An estimated 1% of the recalled vehicles have the defect, according to the report.\n\nFCA US also issued a supplemental recall for 764 Mopar-branded head restraints intended for 2022-2025 Grand Cherokee and Jeep Grand Cherokee L models. However, in a notification to dealers altering them of the recall, the automaker said that parts are not currently available. A remedy is estimated to become available in the third quarter, according to the recall report.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Stellantis Recalls 121K Jeeps Over Safety Standard Violation\n\n**Key details:** FCA US, a Stellantis subsidiary, has recalled over 121,000 2023-2024 Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L SUVs. The recall is due to second-row head restraints that may not lock in the upright position after the seats are lowered. This issue violates Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requiring head restraints to be at least 750 millimeters high. Stellantis dealers will inspect and replace the affected head restraints if necessary.\n\n**Why it matters:** This recall points to potential quality control challenges within Stellantis' vehicle production, impacting the new Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L models. The direct violation of federal safety standards could erode consumer confidence and brand reputation for Jeep models. This broad recall, despite only an estimated 1% defect rate, might challenge the perception of consistent build quality in recent Stellantis vehicles. Additionally, a supplemental recall for Mopar-branded head restraints with currently unavailable parts signals further operational hurdles.\n\n**The big picture:** The second-row head restraints are designed to fold forward for cargo space but may not lock back upright when returned to position. Stellantis' Technical Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization began investigating the problem on August 13, 2024, after customer reports. The investigation identified a \"vehicle build issue\" and concluded that the problem violated safety standards, leading to a voluntary recall. The head restraints were sourced from Grammer Americas, a U.S. subsidiary of Germany-based Tier 1 supplier Grammer Industries.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 121,000: Jeep models recalled by FCA US.\n*   2023-2024: Model years affected (Cherokee, Grand Cherokee L SUVs).\n*   1%: Estimated percentage of recalled vehicles with the defect.\n*   764: Mopar-branded head restraints affected in a supplemental recall.\n*   750 millimeters: Required minimum height for head restraints from the seat bottom.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Stellantis: Automaker conducting the voluntary recall of Jeep models.\n*   FCA US: Stellantis' North American subsidiary recalling over 121,000 Jeep models.\n*   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Organization noting the recall of Jeep models.\n*   Grammer Americas: U.S. subsidiary supplying the defective head restraints for recalled vehicles.\n*   Grammer Industries: Germany-based Tier 1 supplier, parent company of Grammer Americas.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Stellantis will begin notifying customers for the main recall on September 5.\n*   A remedy for the supplemental Mopar-branded head restraints is estimated to become available in the third quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Jeep recalls signal potential quality control issues, impacting investor confidence.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nReturn-to-office mandates are heating up again, with well-known companies like Starbucks, Target and Google in the past month ordering employees to increase their time in the office. Some have initiated voluntary exit programs for those who would rather not.\n\nHybrid work arrangements remain common and integral to the current workplace, however, with office operators investing in collaboration technologies that can effectively facilitate flexible work and engagement between employees, whether they are in the office or remote, according to recent studies.\n\nStarbucks corporate employees will have to return to the office four days a week starting in October, the company announced July 14, offering workers who would prefer to leave a \u201cone-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment,\u201d CEO Brian Niccol said in a letter to employees, CNBC reported. The company head previously told workers they were at risk of being fired if they didn\u2019t return to the office three days a week.\n\nTarget\u2019s commercial unit employees are being asked to return to the office at least three days a week starting Sept. 2, CBS News reported. The Minnesota-based staff will be able to pick which week days suit them best, according to a memo by Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Maplewood-based 3M informed employees that it will require them to be in the office at least four days a week, while U.S. Bank and General Mills this year enacted their own three-day-a-week office mandates. The state is also pushing for more attendance from workers, with Gov. Tim Walz asking state workers to return to the office for 50% of their workdays.\n\nWalmart and Google have issued similar orders in the past six months, with Google introducing a voluntary exit program for some U.S. teams and tightening return-to-office policies for remote employees living near offices, Fortune reported July 11.\n\nA survey by Cisco found a \u201cclear, global trend toward increased in-office work,\u201d with 72% of respondents\u2019 organizations having mandates for working in the office, according to the company\u2019s 2025 global hybrid work study released in June. Nearly half, or 46%, of respondents said their organization\u2019s hybrid work policy requires more time in the office than prior policies.\n\nIn part, these initiatives have helped drive an increase in office visits, according to data from location analytics software firm Placer.ai. Following a decrease in attendance in May, foot traffic recovered in June, improving 8.3% year over year, but still 27.4% below 2019 levels. June was the fourth busiest in-office month since the pandemic, according to the Placer.ai, which analyzed foot traffic data from about 1,000 U.S. office buildings.\n\nThe increase in attendance was led by Miami and New York, with both nearing full post-pandemic recovery. Atlanta, Dallas and Houston also outperformed the U.S. overall. San Francisco, which remained furthest from pre-pandemic attendance levels, also was making progress toward getting people into the office, Placer.ai says.\n\nHybrid work, collaboration tools remain crucial\n\nDespite the trend, 40% of interactions in the office still have at least one person joining remotely, on average, according to Cisco\u2019s survey.\n\nHybrid work arrangements remain \u201ca cornerstone of the modern workplace,\u201d Cisco says. It notes that 90% or more of employers and employees recognize collaboration technology as crucial to enabling engagement and flexibility, resulting in increasing investments in these technologies.\n\nDespite the availability of collaboration tools, only 49% of employees feel workflows are seamless across all work locations, underscoring the need for better technology devices and capabilities that can provide better employee experience, according to the report.\n\n\u201cAs the future of work continues to evolve, it is essential to invest in flexible and scalable technology that adapts to changing workforce needs,\u201d Amit Barave, vice president of product management for Webex at Cisco, told Facilities Dive in an email. \u201cAt a high level, facilities and IT must prioritize an integrated and seamless experience to ensuring that hardware and software work together harmoniously. This enhances operational efficiency and also provides a cohesive user experience that supports productivity.\u201d\n\nIntegration of the tools is key, Barave said.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, success hinges on understanding the actual workflows and needs of your employees,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore making deployment decisions, take time to understand how teams collaborate, what their pain points are, and how new tools can genuinely enhance their day-to-day.\u201d\n\nAdvanced analytics tools can help leaders assess employee satisfaction and the adoption of collaboration tools and workplace resources, according to Barave. But facility managers must be careful when making decisions around these tools, especially as it relates to the technical support required to maintain them, he said.\n\nFor example, when weighing in-house versus outsourced support for these technologies, operators must critically assess several key aspects, such as the specialized expertise of support teams for hybrid tools; their scalability and flexibility; and robust security and compliance measures.\n\nThey also must ensure there are clear service level agreements in place for response times, and determine whether the support is proactive or merely reactive, Barave said.\n\n\u201cThe user experience for accessing support is critical as well, as it must be intuitive and efficient for employees working from anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better serve organizations and their employees during this transition period, the relationship between facility managers, real estate operators and businesses must take the form of a strategic partnership, according to Barave.\n\n\u201cThe key is regular, proactive conversations focused on understanding each business\u2019s goals \u2014 especially as hybrid work continues to evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cFacilities managers and operators can ask, \u2018What are your priorities for the next 12\u201324 months, and how can our spaces help you achieve them?\u2019 and provide data-driven insights to support better decisions.\u201d\n\nCorporate and commercial real estate operators should also establish clear metrics for success and a feedback loop. By measuring tangible outcomes, like increased productivity and improved employee satisfaction, office operators can validate technology investments, identify areas for adjustment and continue to better align their solutions with evolving business needs, according to Barave.\n\n\u201cSuccess comes from listening closely, adapting together, and always aiming to enhance partners\u2019 business outcomes,\u201d he said.",

However, any loan amounts repaid cannot be reborrowed.\n\nAs a condition of the agreement, Ford must maintain a minimum of $4 billion in liquidity, which includes cash, marketable securities, and availability under its other credit facilities, according to the filing.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe unsecured $3 billion loan agreement signals a sign of confidence from Ford\u2019s institutional lenders, which include Barclays, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The automaker is not required to put down any company assets as collateral.\n\nIn addition, the loan includes a material adverse change conditions clause. Ford's ability to draw upon the funds is not subject to any adverse change conditions or credit rating triggers, which means that the company can still access the loan even if its financial condition changes or its credit rating is downgraded.\n\nIn May, Morningstar confirmed Ford\u2019s credit rating as BBB (low), citing its conservative financial policy and solid balance sheet over the past few years. Morningstar expects that Ford will remain significantly profitable, but its rating indicates that Ford\u2019s business is still vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\n\nEarlier this month, Ford reported Q2 sales of 612,095 vehicles, a 14.2% year-over-year increase. Truck sales, including F-Series pickups, were up 15.1% from last year.\n\nBut Ford and other automakers face uncertainties in the short term around significant changes in tariffs and trade policies that could impact vehicle sales, increase supply chain costs and erode profits. The current business climate led to Ford, General Motors and Stellantis suspending their full-year guidance in the spring.\n\nIn May, Ford said that tariffs would result in a $2.5 billion decline in gross profit and a $1.5 billion decline in net profit in 2025. While its rival GM expects tariffs to cost between $4 billion and $5 billion this year. Stellantis, however, has since reinstated its previous forecast, although the automaker reported a 13% year-over-year decline in H2 revenue this year.\n\nIn April, a Tariff Impact Analysis report published by the Center for Automotive Research concluded that tariffs will raise costs for all domestic automakers by $107.7 billion in 2025.\n\nBut securing the loan helps ensure that Ford can better withstand any unexpected downturn in its business, including a recession. It also provides the automaker with more flexibility in its medium-term capital planning, which includes investments in electrification to launch new hybrid models.\n\nThe funds can also be used to address a record-high number of recalls in 2025 that extend to over 5 million vehicles since Jan. 1. Two weeks ago, the automaker recalled around 694,000 vehicles for fuel injectors that may crack and leak fuel. It followed a recall of 850K vehicles for low-pressure fuel delivery module failures that have led to engine stalling while driving.\n\nAddressing the high number of recalls and performing the necessary repairs under warranty could be costly for Ford.",

The move signals potential for further trade restrictions beyond the initial 50% tariff, as additional tariffs on refined copper are recommended for 2027 and 2028. A 25% domestic sales requirement for copper inputs and scrap was also recommended.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFord Motor Co. on Wednesday reported a net loss of $36 million in the second quarter, citing costs associated with a field service action and the cancellation of a battery-electric vehicle program. Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $2.1 billion, which Ford said included $800 million in tariff costs.\n\nThe hit from tariffs significantly helped wipe out the automaker's net profit, marking its first quarterly loss since 2023.\n\nNevertheless, Ford saw strong sales in the quarter: 612,095 vehicles in the U.S., or a 14.2% increase from a year ago. Its electrified-vehicle (including BEVs, plug-in-electric vehicles and hybrids) sales totaled 82,886 during the quarter, up 6.6% from Q2 2024.\n\nFor Q2 2025, Ford reported revenue of $50.2 billion versus $44.14 billion estimated per Bloomberg consensus, up 5% compared to a year ago.\n\nFord posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 versus $0.33 expected, on adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.1 billion vs $1.91 billion estimated.\n\nThe Blue Oval automaker\u2019s estimate for tariff costs for the year rose $500 million to $3 billion, up from $2.5 billion predicted last spring.\n\nThe automaker said it now plans to record full year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, down from its February 2025 projection of between $7 billion and $8.5 billion.\n\nFord\u2019s domestic production accounts for about 80% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., according to GlobalData. Ford\u2019s tariff losses are less than those for other Detroit-based OEMs General Motors and Stellantis, but it must still deal with steep levies on aluminum, steel and copper.\n\nCEO Jim Farley says the company is targeting a $1 billion improvement in material costs as a partial offset to tariff expenses.\n\nAs problematic as tariffs are, additional offsets coming from Trump administration deregulation moves, such as a rollback of emissions standards, which will result in Ford being able to increase sales of its most profitable internal-combustion-engine-powered trucks and SUVs.\n\nCommercial unit and ICE business shine, Model e struggles\n\nThe Ford Pro commercial-vehicle business continues to be a growth area for the automaker, generating $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of 12.3% on $18.8 billion in revenue. Ford Pro\u2019s paid subscriptions grew 24% year-over-year to 757,000. \u201cFord Pro is a unique competitive advantage driving both top- and bottom-line growth while creating new high-margin revenue streams from software and physical services,\u201d says Farley.\n\nRevenues for the Ford Model e business unit, which includes battery-electric vehicles and software, climbed 105% to $2.4 billion, but it is still losing money to the tune of $1.329 billion. The automaker said it expects to lose up to $5.5 billion on its BEV and software business in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford Blue, which represents the automaker\u2019s traditional ICE vehicles, reported $661 million in EBIT.\n\nTariff talk\n\nFarley tells Bloomberg the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a \"meaningful\" cost advantage. Last week, President Trump said the U.S. would lower tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%. The reduced tariffs, lower labor costs and favorable exchange rates \"really advantage their export (business),\" Farley said.\n\nA Kentucky-built Ford Escape could cost $5,000 more than a Japan-made Toyota RAV4, while a Michigan-made Ford Bronco might be undercut by a Toyota 4Runner to the tune of $10,000, Farley added.\n\nFord's finance chief Sherry House said in a post-earnings call with analysts and media the firm had raised its forecast for the cost of tariffs on its business because levies on Mexico and Canada, where it has facilities, have remained higher for longer than expected.\n\n\u201cA Model T moment\u201d\n\nEven with a sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit supporting the purchase of BEVs coming on Sept. 30, Farley teased on the earnings call a mid-August showcase of the company\u2019s BEV manufacturing complex in Kentucky. He says the combination of a low-cost, simpler BEV architecture combined with new, lower-cost manufacturing processes it will lay out is a \u201cModel T moment\u201d \u2013 referring to the landmark transformation in lower-cost.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Ford Posts Q2 Loss Amid Rising Tariff Costs, Cuts Full-Year Outlook\n\n**Key details:**\nFord reported a Q2 net loss of $36 million, its first quarterly loss since 2023, primarily due to $800 million in tariff costs and other expenses. Despite the loss, the automaker saw strong U.S. vehicle sales, up 14.2% year-over-year, and electrified-vehicle sales rose 6.6% from Q2 2024. Q2 revenue of $50.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.37 both exceeded analyst estimates.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nFord's net loss, driven by significant tariff costs, directly impacts its profitability and marks its first quarterly loss since 2023. The company also increased its full-year tariff cost estimate to $3 billion and lowered its adjusted EBIT outlook for the year. This revised guidance challenges the prior consensus view of higher full-year profitability, despite strong Q2 sales and revenue beating estimates. The Model e business unit continues to incur substantial losses, expecting up to $5.5 billion in 2025.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTariffs are a significant and growing financial burden for Ford, with full-year cost estimates rising to $3 billion. While Ford's tariff losses are less than some rivals, the levies on materials and higher tariffs on Mexico and Canada remain problematic. CEO Jim Farley aims for $1 billion in material cost improvements to partially offset these expenses. Additionally, Trump administration deregulation on emissions standards may allow Ford to increase sales of profitable internal-combustion-engine vehicles. The company's commercial unit, Ford Pro, is a strong performer, while the Model e BEV business continues to incur significant losses.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Q2 Net Loss:** $36 million, marking its first quarterly loss since 2023.\n*   **Q2 Tariff Costs:** $800 million, included in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes.\n*   **Full-Year Tariff Costs Estimate:** Raised to $3 billion, up from $2.5 billion predicted.\n*   **Full-Year Adjusted EBIT Projection:** Lowered to $6.5 billion-$7.5 billion, from $7 billion-$8.5 billion.\n*   **Model e Q2 Loss:** $1.329 billion, with an expected loss of up to $5.5 billion in 2025 for BEV and software business.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ford Motor Co.:** Reported a net loss and lowered full-year profit outlook due to rising tariff costs.\n*   **Jim Farley:** Ford CEO, targeting material cost improvements and discussed competitor tariff advantages.\n*   **Sherry House:** Ford finance chief, explained higher tariff cost forecast due to Mexico and Canada levies.\n*   **Bloomberg:** Provided consensus estimates for Ford's Q2 revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes.\n*   **GlobalData:** Provided data on Ford's domestic production percentage of U.S. vehicle sales.\n*   **Trump administration:** Implemented deregulation moves and tariff reductions impacting Ford's competitive landscape.\n*   **General Motors:** Identified as a Detroit-based OEM with higher tariff losses compared to Ford.\n*   **Stellantis:** Identified as a Detroit-based OEM with higher tariff losses compared to Ford.\n*   **Toyota:** Cited by Ford's CEO as an Asian rival gaining cost advantages from reduced tariffs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A mid-August showcase of Ford's BEV manufacturing complex in Kentucky is planned.\n*   The $7,500 federal tax credit for BEV purchases will sunset on September 30.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRising tariffs and BEV losses are eroding Ford's profits and full-year outlook.",

The case consolidated a series of lawsuits relating to the outage, including one 2022 complaint originally filed in Alabama.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe facts outlined in Albert are notable given the steps Honda said it took during and after the events of the Kronos outage to compensate employees. The company was one of several forced to take emergency actions to address payroll concerns following the incident.\n\nFor example, Honda offered affected employees a $1,000 interest-free loan during the second week of the outage and implemented a new pay method that would compensate nonexempt employees for 40 hours at their regular rate, as well as three hours at their overtime rate, per court documents.\n\nAfter the outage was resolved, Honda began a reconciliation process in which it attempted to reconcile differences between the new pay method and what should have been paid to affected workers. This \u201cinvolved analyzing about three million Kronos time swipes, recovering missing scans, and reviewing call-in and leave-of-absence records,\u201d the court said.\n\nHonda issued approximately 20,000 reconciliation payment statements to employees, including a gross amount of more than $2,000 to the lead plaintiff in Albert. When he disputed the amounts provided for certain weeks of the outage, Honda paid the plaintiff for all hours at all pay codes that he asserted for the disputed weeks, as well as an additional inconvenience payment and attendance bonus.\n\nNonetheless, the plaintiff claimed that Honda did not act in good faith because the company lacked a backup timekeeping system before the incident that would have allowed it to continue to track workers\u2019 hours. He also alleged that Honda\u2019s payment was excessively delayed in violation of the FLSA as well as Ohio\u2019s Prompt Pay Act.\n\nSargus held that Honda failed to show that the lead plaintiff \u201clacks evidence that his overtime payments were delayed for a period longer than reasonably necessary.\u201d He declined to opine on the question of whether the company owed back pay or liquidated damages to the plaintiff.\n\nOther employers affected by the outage settled workers\u2019 lawsuits for millions of dollars in recent years. For instance, food corporation Cargill agreed to a $2.4 million settlement of similar claims in 2023, while health system UMass Memorial Health reached a $1.2 million settlement that same year.\n\nLitigation over the outage also has extended to UKG, the HR vendor and parent company of Kronos. The ransomware attack against UKG that precipitated the outage raised questions about HR vendors\u2019 legal liability during disruptions caused by cybercrime.",

        "summary": "Here's a \"Smart Brevity\" summary of the article, focusing on investor implications:\n\n### Honda Overtime Lawsuit Proceeds After Kronos Outage, Judge Denies Summary Judgment\n\n**Key details:**\nA federal judge ruled an employee's lawsuit against Honda's U.S. division can proceed regarding unpaid overtime following the 2021 Kronos outage. Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. denied Honda\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the question of excessively delayed compensation. However, Sargus granted Honda's motion for summary judgment on a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s Ohio state law claims. A decision on whether Honda is criminally liable under Ohio law was held in abeyance.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis ruling challenges the sufficiency of Honda's stated efforts to compensate employees after the Kronos incident. Despite Honda offering loans, new pay methods, and reconciliation processes, the judge found the company failed to show payments were not excessively delayed. This outcome suggests companies may face ongoing legal challenges and liabilities from cybersecurity-related operational disruptions, even after taking corrective payroll actions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis lawsuit consolidates several complaints stemming from the 2021 Kronos outage, caused by a ransomware attack against its parent company, UKG. Other employers like Cargill and UMass Memorial Health settled similar worker lawsuits for millions. The broader litigation raises questions about HR vendors' legal liability during cybercrime-induced disruptions.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **2021:** Year of the Kronos outage.\n*   **$1,000:** Interest-free loan offered to affected Honda employees.\n*   **3 million:** Approximate number of Kronos time swipes analyzed by Honda during reconciliation.\n*   **20,000:** Approximate number of reconciliation payment statements issued by Honda.\n*   **$2,000+:** Gross amount initially paid to the lead plaintiff in Albert.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC:** Sued for alleged FLSA and state law violations regarding unpaid overtime.\n*   **Albert:** Lead plaintiff alleging excessively delayed overtime payments following the 2021 Kronos outage.\n*   **Judge Edmund Sargus Jr.:** Federal judge who denied Honda's summary judgment motion regarding overtime payment delays.\n*   **Kronos:** Timekeeping system provider that experienced a 2021 outage from a ransomware attack.\n*   **Cargill:** Food corporation that settled similar worker lawsuits for $2.4 million in 2023.\n*   **UMass Memorial Health:** Health system that reached a $1.2 million settlement for similar claims.\n*   **UKG:** HR vendor and Kronos parent company facing litigation over the ransomware attack.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A decision on whether Honda is criminally liable under Ohio law is still pending.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nHonda faces continued legal and financial exposure from the 2021 Kronos outage.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nGlobal shipping and mailing company Pitney Bowes appointed board director Paul Evans to become CFO, EVP and treasurer, effective July 29, according to a Wednesday release. Evans, who steps down from the board to take the finance reins, succeeds Robert Gold, who is departing just about five months after his appointment was announced in February, according to a company release at the time.\n\nappointed board director Paul Evans Robert Gold, who is departing Evans, 57, has served as a member of the board since October 2024 and as a managing member at FSS Capital, an advisory firm that provides managed capital to startup ventures, since 2021, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He previously also served as COO and director of America\u2019s Auto Auction Group, an automotive remarketing entity, from January 2023 to October 2023. His past experience also includes a stint in 2020 and 2021 as CFO of Sevan Multi-Site Solutions, a private-equity-backed provider of construction services, and he also previously held multiple roles including CAO at MYR Group, a public holding company.\n\nA company spokesperson on Friday declined to comment as to the reasons for the swift change in finance leadership, pointing to CEO Kurt Wolf\u2019s comments during the company\u2019s earnings call this week. \u201cWith respect to the CFO position, this in no way \u2014 the change in no way reflected on Bob. He's an excellent CFO. Just \u2014 it's not often that I feel like we have an opportunity to bring in a talent like Paul,\u201d Wolf said, noting that he had a \u201ctremendous working relationship\u201d with and the same values as Evans. \u201cWe have the same focus within running a business in terms of creating urgency, creating discipline, data-driven decision-making, et cetera. So it was just \u2014 it's really a comment on the opportunity that we had to bring somebody of Paul's caliber.\u201d \u200b\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe shift is the latest in a series of C-suite changes that the Stamford, Connecticut-based company has undergone recently. Last March, then-CFO Ana Maria Chadwick resigned after about three years in the role, in the wake of the company naming Jason Dies to fill in as interim CEO in October for outgoing Marc Lautenbach, CFO Dive previously reported. Chadwick subsequently took the CFO seat at the Acton, Massachusetts-based medical device maker Insulet.\n\nWolf, then a sitting director of Pitney Bowes, was named CEO in May, succeeding Lance Rosenzweig, who stepped down just seven months after being named CEO. The founder of Hestia Capital Management, Wolf is an \u201cactivist investor\u201d that along with three other nominees from Hestia joined the board in 2023 after a proxy battle, according to a May 22 report from Hartford Business. In a letter to shareholders shared in the company\u2019s Wednesday\u2019s earnings release, Wolf said he served with Evans on the board of directors of GameStop in 2020 and 2021.\n\nEvans \u201chas a proven record of helping businesses successfully allocate capital, manage their balance sheets and pursue enhanced profitability. When Paul and I served together on the board of directors of GameStop in 2020 and 2021, we worked side-by-side to help recapitalize the balance sheet, eliminate debt and enhance shareholder value,\u201d the letter states. Videogame retailer GameStop has been viewed as a so-called \u201cmeme stock,\u201d with its shares rising nearly 700% in a few weeks in early 2021 but it has been missing from the latest surge in such trading, Barron\u2019s reported.\n\nThe over 100-year-old Pitney Bowes has faced headwinds as it has sought in recent years to expand beyond its iconic postage meter and mailing equipment roots into parcel and e-commerce shipping, CFO Dive previously reported. In its second quarter, the company\u2019s revenue ticked down to $462 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year, but the company\u2019s GAAP net income improved, hitting $29.9 million, compared to a $24.9 million loss in the year-earlier period, the company reported this week.\n\nUnder the terms of his employment letter, Evans will receive an annual base salary of $600,000, less certain withholdings and payroll deductions, an annual incentive award with a target value of 80% of his annual salary and an annual long-term equity base incentive award with a target grant date value of $1.5 million, according to the SEC filing.",

Now, however, that approach is \u201cyielding to a, \u2018I need to act now\u201d mindset, Sankar said in an interview.\n\nAgentic AI checks and balances\n\nAs CFOs seek to navigate economic turmoil and changing business needs, they have continued to mull how AI could best benefit their organizations and members of the finance team.\n\n\u201cMany CFOs are starting to spend a significant chunk of their time looking to\u2026\u2018what is the potential of AI?\u2019\u201d Sankar said. \u201cWhere can I invest in agents today so that I can get the benefits of automation?\u201d\n\nAgentic AI \u2014 tools which are crafted to take over tasks without the input of a human \u2014 have captured a widening amount of finance chiefs\u2019 interest in recent months. Many companies, for that matter, have moved out of the \u201cpilot,\u201d or testing phase of such solutions, in favor of production, with about one-third of organizations stating they have moved to full-scale deployment of such tools, according to a recent KPMG survey.\n\nAs finance chiefs contemplate the integration of tools such as agentic AI, they need to be sure they are considering their long-term impact, especially as for some, the end goal of such tools is to have agentic AI performing tasks without human interaction, Sankar said.\n\n\u201cHow can I provide a certain level of checks and balances to ensure that it is doing the right thing and that the numbers coming out of a task performed by agentic AI are as reliable as the numbers performed by my accountant, who's been doing this for 10 years?\u201d he said.\n\nFinance chiefs are looking to find the right place for agentic AI solutions as spending on such tools continues to ramp up: according to a recent study by Big Four firm Ernst & Young, 35% of leaders anticipate their organizations will spend more than $10 million on such technologies in the next year, EY found. Nearly three-quarters of senior leaders also believe entire business units will be managed by agentic AI, according to the study.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say agentic AI tools will entirely replace humans: \u201cI don't think CFOs are in a hurry to get rid of their people, and replace them with agents,\u201d Sankar said, noting the more complex tasks and analysis will always have a human in the loop.\n\nBut, as the business grows, executives may not be meeting that growth with more headcount, because \u201cthese technologies have the potential to deliver a level of automation where you can do more with the existing people,\u201d he said.\n\nAchieving the accounting, tech skill balance\n\nAI\u2019s continued evolution is occurring at the same time as the role of the CFO continues to change, with CEOs leaning more and more heavily on their finance chiefs to drive strategy as well as keep the finance function running smoothly. The broadening of the finance chief role is \u201creflecting in their desire to make investments, their desire to sponsor projects, their desire to hire the right talent or train the existing talent, to become more AI savvy, to become more data savvy,\u201d Sankar said.\n\nIt\u2019s also contributing to a ripple effect throughout the finance department \u2014 controllers, for instance, are gaining responsibility not just for providing the numbers, but \u201cresponsibility to provide clean, consolidated, curated data to the rest of the business,\u201d Sankar said. The financial planning and analysis team, meanwhile, is morphing into a group responsible for supporting \u201cagile decision-making\u201d throughout the organization.\n\nAs the finance function sees its roles and responsibilities continue to evolve, it will be critical to ensure members of the team have the right mix of both core accounting and finance as well as technical skills. Future financial professionals may not need to become data scientists or AI model experts, Sankar said, but they need to develop a \u201csufficient understanding of the technology\u201d so they can properly utilize it to meet the changing needs of their role.\n\n\u201cThere'll be a balance between accounting domain knowledge and broader business knowledge and technical savvy,\u201d Sankar said of how finance functions in the future will be structured.",

For the current fiscal year, Microsoft anticipates that it will deliver \u201canother year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth,\u201d according to Hood.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog,\u201d she said during an earnings call.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOn the heels of the better-than-expected quarterly earnings, Microsoft\u2019s stock price jumped 5% on Thursday, pushing the company's valuation beyond the $4 trillion mark, according to a CNBC report.\n\nThe company joined chipmaker Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier in July, the report said.\n\n\u201cIf this growth is maintained, it significantly reduces the risk that Microsoft would need to rethink its massive AI-related CAPEX, even if competitive pressure increases,\u201d Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the company\u2019s ability to balance heavy AI investment with margin expansion shows it can scale efficiently into FY26, regardless of external challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nMicrosoft and other tech giants continue to bet heavily on AI as investors eagerly look for signs that its paying off. Meanwhile, economic uncertainty triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff measures has created added pressure for big tech firms.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 third quarter ended March 31, Microsoft\u2019s capex, including finance leases, totaled $21.4 billion. That amount was \u201cslightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases,\u201d Hood said during an earnings call in late April.\n\nAt the time, Hood said Microsoft expected its capex to grow at a slower pace in its upcoming fiscal year starting in July. This came after the company confirmed a pullback in AI data center projects.\n\nThe company\u2019s capex during its most recent quarter was $24.2 billion, Hood said on Wednesday.\n\nReiterating comments she made earlier this year, Hood said Microsoft\u2019s capex growth in the current fiscal year will moderate. \u201cDue to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2,\u201d the finance chief said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Microsoft's AI Investments Soar Amid Strong Demand and Revenue Growth\n\n**Key details:** Microsoft expects its current quarter capital expenditures to exceed $30 billion due to strong demand signals for cloud and AI offerings. The company reported $281.7 billion in total revenues for its last fiscal year, a 15% year-over-year spike. CFO Amy Hood anticipates another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the current fiscal year. Microsoft plans continued investment given its leadership in commercial cloud and significant contracted backlog.\n\n**Why it matters:** Microsoft's stock jumped 5% following better-than-expected earnings, pushing its valuation beyond $4 trillion. This strong performance reduces the risk that Microsoft would need to rethink its massive AI-related capital expenditures. The company's ability to balance heavy AI investment with margin expansion shows it can scale efficiently into fiscal year 2026. This might challenge a view that large AI investments would inherently strain profitability or require a strategy pivot.\n\n**The big picture:** Tech giants, including Microsoft, are heavily betting on AI, with investors keenly watching for returns. Economic uncertainty, fueled by President Donald Trump's tariff measures, has created added pressure for large tech firms. Earlier, Microsoft's capital expenditure was slightly lower than expected due to variability in data center lease deliveries. CFO Hood had previously suggested a slower pace of capex growth, but now expects higher growth rates in the first half of the current fiscal year.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n* Current quarter capex: Expected to exceed $30 billion.\n* Last fiscal year total revenues: $281.7 billion.\n* Year-over-year revenue spike: 15%.\n* Stock price jump (Thursday): 5%.\n* Company valuation (Thursday): Beyond $4 trillion.\n\n**Key Players:**\n* Microsoft: Software giant expecting strong capital expenditures and continued revenue growth.\n* Amy Hood: Microsoft CFO, detailed the company's financial outlook and investment plans.\n* Nvidia: Chipmaker that previously reached a $4 trillion valuation in July.\n* Thomas Monteiro: Senior analyst at Investing.com, commented on Microsoft's AI investment efficiency.\n* President Donald Trump: His tariff measures created economic uncertainty for big tech firms.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Microsoft's strong growth validates its massive AI investments amidst market pressures.",

Imports already in transit by August 7 will not incur duties if entered for consumption by October 5.

It codifies previously announced or threatened tariffs, such as the 25% rate on India. The move marks a definitive implementation of country-specific duties first unveiled in April, impacting import costs for over 60 trading partners. This will alter trade dynamics for businesses importing from these specific countries.\n\n**The big picture:** President Trump signed an executive order Thursday, codifying country-specific duties he first unveiled in April.

It introduces a \"practical expedient\" allowing all entities to assume current conditions remain stable for an asset's life. Private entities can now also consider post-balance sheet collection activity in their credit loss estimations. The change addresses private companies' feedback on complex and costly forecasting requirements.\n\n**Why it matters:** This new guidance is expected to reduce the time and effort companies spend estimating credit losses for current accounts receivable and contract assets.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Fed Holds Rates Amid Dissent, Weighs Inflation Against Job Market\n\n**Key details:** Federal Reserve policymakers Wednesday held the benchmark interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. This decision occurred despite rare dissenting votes from two officials, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, who called for a quarter-point rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintained that labor market conditions \"have remained solid\" while inflation \"remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2% long-run goal.\" He also stated the economy is not performing as if a restrictive policy is holding it back.\n\n**Why it matters:** The Fed's choice reflects a reluctance among officials to trim borrowing costs before gaining greater confidence that high import duties will not reignite inflation. This challenges a consensus view by prioritizing price stability over potential labor market weakness. Dissenters argue such patience disregards signs of job market weakness and may prompt an unnecessary rise in unemployment. The article highlights the central bank's dilemma in balancing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n\n**The big picture:** The central bank is mandated by Congress to ensure both price stability and full employment. Powell and most colleagues support a wait-and-see strategy before rate trimming, warning that high import duties could spur sustained price jumps. While inflation persists above the 2% target, some data points suggest a cooling labor market, including falling job openings and a lower hiring rate. This situation poses a challenge, as moving too soon could fail to fix inflation, while moving too late might damage the labor market.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Benchmark interest rate: 4.25% and 4.5%\n*   Inflation target: 2%\n*   Consumer Price Index (CPI) annual rate (June): 2.7%\n*   Hiring rate: 3.3% (one of the lowest levels since 2013)\n*   Gross domestic product (first six months): 1.2% annual growth\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Reserve:** Policymakers who decided to hold the benchmark interest rate steady despite dissenting votes.\n*   **Michelle Bowman:** Fed governor who supported a quarter-point rate cut due to signs of job market weakness.\n*   **Christopher Waller:** Fed governor who supported a quarter-point rate cut, citing weakness in the job market.\n*   **Jerome Powell:** Fed Chair who disagreed with rate cuts, stating the labor market is solid and inflation elevated.\n*   **Labor Department:** Released data showing job openings fell and the hiring rate declined in June.\n*   **The Conference Board:** Stated consumer perception of jobs being hard to find rose to 18.9% this month.\n*   **Bureau of Economic Analysis:** Released preliminary data on Gross Domestic Product for the first and second quarters.\n*   **Bureau of Labor Statistics:** Reported the consumer price index's annual rate for June and the prior month.\n*   **Trump administration:** Implemented higher import duties that influenced Gross Domestic Product numbers.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Fed held rates, signaling stubborn inflation concern over weakening job market.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe Boeing Company narrowed its net loss and reported a 35% boost in revenue for its most recent quarter, coming as the aircraft manufacturer continues to face regulatory and economic headwinds. The company\u2019s core loss per share of $1.24 was \u201ca significant improvement compared to last year,\u201d CFO Brian West said Tuesday during the company\u2019s earnings call, citing higher commercial deliveries as well as improved operational performance as key drivers.\n\nThe Arlington, Virginia-based company\u2019s latest earnings come several weeks after Boeing announced it would be appointing Lockheed Martin veteran Jay Malave as its CFO, effective Aug. 15, CFO Dive previously reported. West is set to transition to the role of senior advisor also as of Aug. 15.\n\n\u201cI also want to extend my deep appreciation of Brian West for his outstanding work over the last four years to stabilize our business and navigate the recovery, all while continuing to position the company for our future,\u201d President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said Tuesday during the company\u2019s second quarter earnings call. \u201cI look forward to welcoming Jay to Boeing and Brian's continued counsel in his new role.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs CFO, Malave is set to receive an annual base salary of $1.05 million, as well as a cash award of $1.5 million, according to a July 3 securities filing. He will also be eligible to receive an annual bonus with a target value of 120% of his base salary, and beginning in 2026 will be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards with a target value of $6.5 million, per the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn \u201clight of his recent employment\u201d with Lockheed Martin, Malave has also agreed to certain conditions related to his appointment as Boeing\u2019s finance chief, including not participating in the Boeing Defense, Space & Security business until the end of the year, according to the filing. Boeing has also agreed to pay Lockheed $2 million \u201cin connection with a release of claims relating to Mr. Malave\u2019s employment with the Company.\u201d\n\nMalave, who served as Lockheed Martin\u2019s finance chief for three years before departing this past April, is poised to take the financial reins at the jet maker as Boeing seeks to execute on a turnaround plan aimed at regaining profitability and repairing both consumer and regulatory trust in its business.\n\nThe company narrowed its net loss for the quarter ended June 30 to $612 million compared to $1.43 billion for the prior year period. Revenue, meanwhile, spiked 35% to hit $22.7 billion for the quarter. The jet maker also narrowed its cash burn to $200 million for its Q2, compared to $4.3 billion for the prior year period \u2014 an improvement CFO West also attributed to higher commercial deliveries and working capital.\n\nThe jet maker is still facing a number of challenges, however, including continued scrutiny from regulators following several plane crashes and incidents in recent years.\n\nThe company remains under a production cap for its 737 aircraft, imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration following a January 2024 incident where a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines flight. In June, the FAA found that Boeing failed to provide adequate training and oversight for its manufacturing operations, which led to the incident.\n\nBoeing remains on track to request approval from the FAA to expand production of its 737 aircrafts to 42 per month from the current 38 per month cap, CEO Ortberg said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn 737, you'll recall our plan was to methodically ramp up to 38 per month, stabilize at that rate and then request an approval from the FAA for the next rate increase to 42 aircraft a month,\u201d he said in response to questions. For its Q2, Boeing delivered 150 commercial jets, and achieved its rate of 38 737 planes per month, and is \u201cnow focused on demonstrating stability at that rate.\n\nWe'll continue to use key performance indicators that have been agreed to with the FAA to measure the health of the production system,\u201d Ortberg said, noting Boeing \u201cexpects to be in a position\u201d to request approval to increase the cap to 42 planes in the company months.\n\nOrtberg also downplayed the risk of a possible strike of approximately 3,200 employees in the company\u2019s fighter and munitions facilities in St. Louis and St. Charles, noting the \u201cthe order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,\u201d when about 30,000 machinists went on strike.\n\n\u201cWe'll manage through this,\u201d Ortberg said of the impending strike. \u201cI wouldn't worry too much about the implications of the strike. We'll manage our way through that.\u201d",

Revenue increased 35% to $22.7 billion, driven by higher commercial deliveries and improved operational performance. Core loss per share improved to $1.24, and cash burn narrowed to $200 million. This comes as Jay Malave is set to take over as CFO on August 15.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBoeing's financial improvements suggest progress on its turnaround plan aimed at regaining profitability and trust, despite ongoing regulatory and economic headwinds.

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nNearly one in four (23%) CFOs anticipate their treasury departments will accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method, or purchase such assets as investments, within the next two years, according to a recent survey by Big Four firm Deloitte found. That percentage jumps to 39% of finance chiefs at companies with revenues at $10 billion or higher, the Q2 2025 North American Signals survey found.\n\nFinance chiefs are eyeing stablecoins in particular \u2014 digital assets with their valuation tied to that of another asset, typically a fiat currency \u2014 as \u201ca practical entry point\u201d into adoption of digital assets, according to a Thursday press release on the survey results. Only 1% of the 200 finance chiefs surveyed don\u2019t expect to utilize stablecoin over the long-term, according to the survey.\n\n\u201cCFOs are thinking beyond any 'crypto hype' and focusing on the practical implications of digital assets,\" Steve Gallucci, U.S. and global leader of Deloitte's CFO Program, said in a statement included in the release. \"They appear to be assessing where cryptocurrency can drive efficiency, reduce friction in global operations and future-proof financial infrastructure. The opportunity isn't just about innovation; it's about making informed, strategic moves that align with enterprise value and control.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nStablecoins have gained increased attention from business and executive leaders during the past year, as the Trump administration takes steps to bring cryptocurrency and digital assets into mainstream finance. In recent weeks, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a regulation which establishes guidelines for issuers of stablecoins.\n\nThe passing of the GENIUS Act helps to add a much-needed level of legitimacy to stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies for finance chiefs, experts previously told CFO Dive, with CFOs taking a closer look at how such assets could be put to best use inside of their businesses.\n\nStablecoins could enable faster and less costly cross-border payments, for example, with 39% of CFOs citing more efficient cross-border payments as a \u201ctop motivator\u201d for the adoption of such assets, Deloitte found. Forty-five percent of finance chiefs also pointed to greater customer privacy as a key motivator for stablecoin adoption, according to the survey.\n\nAs interest in stablecoin grows, finance chiefs are also broaching the topic with other senior leadership. Over a third (37%) of finance chiefs have had conversations with their boards about cryptocurrency, Deloitte\u2019s survey found, while 41% have had such discussions with their chief information officers.\n\nHowever, \u201cthese early conversations might underscore a recognition that any move toward adoption will likely require a robust governance framework and hefty IT support,\u201d according to the survey.\n\nAlthough the GENIUS Act helped to establish clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance, questions regarding cryptocurrency accounting and compliance still linger for CFOs.\n\nLawmakers, for instance, are considering the age-old question of which digital assets might count as securities, and which government bodies have the power to regulate those assets. In recent votes, the House of Representatives passed both the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, or CLARITY Act, as well as the Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, aimed at addressing those gaps.\n\nThe CLARITY Act, sponsored by Rep. French Hill (R-AR), seeks to establish a framework for digital commodities, and looks to provide jurisdiction to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate digital commodities transactions, according to a summary of the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, in a 166-page report issued Wednesday, the cryptocurrency Presidential Working Group established by President Trump in January recommended that lawmakers \u201cbuild on the massive bipartisan House of Representatives vote for CLARITY\u201d by enacting legislation that \u201celiminates existing gaps in regulatory oversight by providing the CFTC authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets,\u201d according to a fact sheet.\n\nAmong other recommendations, the working group\u2019s report also lays out a plan of action for the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, noting the two agencies should utilize their authority to help enable digital asset trading at the federal level.\n\n\u201cAt its core, the PWG report reflects a conviction that I have long held: a rational regulatory framework for digital assets is the best way to catalyze American innovation, protect investors from fraud and keep our capital markets the envy of the world,\u201d SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement on the report released Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, my predecessor and the previous administration did not share that vision. Thank goodness President Trump does and is leading on it.\u201d",

Today, we\u2019re looking at the M&A landscape more broadly as businesses buckle up for the second half.\n\nTariffs have been looming, but experts are almost evenly split on whether they will have an impact on acquisition activity, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. So where do we stand?\n\nIn this week\u2019s \u201c3 Big Numbers,\u201d we look at how M&A is shaking out in 2025.\n\n20% The increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, strategic retail M&A, which includes corporate deals and add-ons, was up 20% through the first five months of the year, according to Bain & Company\u2019s midyear M&A report. And Bain thinks we\u2019ll see more deals this year.\n\n\u201cWe expect consolidation deals will continue to define the M&A market throughout 2025,\u201d Bain said in the report.\n\nBain noted that some of the companies that came through the 2008 financial crisis the strongest were those that used the downturn to strengthen and expand their businesses. That means today\u2019s uncertainty could be an opportunity for well-capitalized companies.\n\n35.7% The decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n\nWhile retail dealmaking has grown, c-stores have been notably more cautious. In fact, convenience store and fuel distribution M&A activity decreased 35.7% year-over-year through mid-May, reaching just nine announced deals, according to a report from investment banking firm Capstone Partners.\n\nActivity has picked up a little during the summer, however. Since the start of June, notable deals have included Gill Energy buying Dutchess Terminals and its 13 retail locations, Applegreen getting the rights to remodel and run 18 travel centers in Massachusetts, Sampson-Bladen Oil Co. agreeing to acquire the 15-location Breeze Thru Markets chain and MAPCO buying 35 stores from Couche-Tard.\n\nSo there\u2019s still hope that 2025 could outperform 2024.\n\n$9.1 billion The price tag on Sunoco\u2019s deal for Parkland Corp.\n\nIn June, Parkland Corp\u2019s shareholders voted to accept energy company Sunoco\u2019s $9.1 billion buyout offer. Now that Alimentation Couche-Tard has withdrawn its bid for 7-Eleven parent company Seven & i, it\u2019s quite possible this will be the biggest deal of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what Sunoco is going to do with the thousands of stores it\u2019s getting in the acquisition, but the industry will surely be watching to see whether it keeps them or sparks a new round of M&A by offloading them.\n\nWho knows? If the upward trajectory in M&A continues, maybe by the end of the year it\u2019ll get unseated at the top of the \u201cbiggest M&A\u201d heap",

The largest deal mentioned is Sunoco's $9.1 billion acquisition of Parkland Corp.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article highlights a significant divergence, with strong growth in overall retail M&A but a notable slowdown in the c-store sector. This mixed performance challenges any simple consensus view on overall acquisition activity, especially concerning tariff impacts, where experts are split. The c-store decline signals caution within that specific industry, while the Sunoco-Parkland deal indicates large transactions are still possible. This divergence means well-capitalized companies may find opportunities amidst sector-specific uncertainty.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis analysis provides an overview of the M&A landscape for the second half of the year, particularly within the c-store industry. It follows an earlier review of impactful c-store M&A deals earlier this year. The market is facing uncertainty, with experts divided on whether looming tariffs will impact acquisition activity. Despite this, consolidation deals are expected to continue defining the M&A market, potentially offering opportunities for strong companies.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   20%: Increase in retail M&A activity year-over-year through May.\n*   35.7%: Decline in c-store M&A year-over-year through mid-May.\n*   9: Announced c-store deals through mid-May.\n*   $9.1 billion: Price tag of Sunoco\u2019s deal for Parkland Corp.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** Report indicated experts are split on tariff impact on M&A activity.\n*   **Bain & Company:** Reported 20% retail M&A increase and expects consolidation deals in 2025.\n*   **Capstone Partners:** Reported 35.7% decline in c-store M&A activity through mid-May.\n*   **Sunoco:** Energy company whose $9.1 billion buyout offer for Parkland Corp. was accepted.\n*   **Parkland Corp.:** Shareholders accepted Sunoco's $9.1 billion buyout offer in June.\n*   **Alimentation Couche-Tard:** Withdrew its bid for 7-Eleven parent company Seven & i.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The industry will watch to see Sunoco's strategy for its acquired thousands of stores.\n*   Ongoing M&A activity will determine if 2025 outperforms 2024.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRetail M&A is up, c-store deals are down, but large transactions persist.",

When including the start of 2026, Murphy anticipates opening 50 new stores within the next 12 months, President and CEO Andrew Clyde said during the call.\n\nThese sites are part of Murphy\u2019s years-long plan to open 500 newly built c-stores by 2033 , a goal which the company launched in 2023. So far, Murphy\u2019s new stores featuring the company\u2019s modernized design are heavily outperforming its traditional locations.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMurphy opened 14 new stores in the first half of the year and, as of Thursday, has 40 additional NTIs under construction, Jeff said. It will begin building another 10 in the next several weeks, Jeff said. The executive added that Murphy should reach 40 NTIs by the end of 2025 as long as it doesn\u2019t experience any \u201csupply chain shocks or jurisdictional delays.\u201d\n\nDuring Q1, Murphy\u2019s new locations \u2014 which are double the size of its traditional 1,400-square-foot sites \u2014 outperformed Murphy\u2019s older stores, with nearly 40% better merchandise margins and 20% more fuel gallons sold.\n\nJeff credited Murphy\u2019s store development team, which is \u201caggressively looking for great sites.\u201d The company\u2019s pipeline of new stores stands at over 250, and Murphy expects to open 15 to 20 more in the first quarter of 2026, he added.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see really good results from the stores that are open, and now we're building the pipeline to open more,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Murphy has had some hiccups in its NTI development over the past year, including scheduling setbacks that hurt fuel and merchandise sales because stores were operating for less time than expected.\n\nIn 2023, Murphy set a five-year plan to generate $1.3 billion in EBITDA by 2028, and Clyde said on Thursday\u2019s call that the retailer is about $20 million behind expectations due to store construction delays. However, the newly built stores are \u201cperforming well above pro forma\u201d and can help make up for lost ground.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory of the business will look far different in 2028 versus what we see today as we ramp up our NTI program,\u201d Clyde said.",

This target, if met, would mean eight more NTIs opening this year than in 2024. Including the start of 2026, the company anticipates opening 50 new stores within the next 12 months. Currently, 40 additional NTIs are under construction, with 10 more beginning building in the next several weeks. These new sites, featuring the company\u2019s modernized design, are heavily outperforming its traditional locations.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe company\u2019s new, modernized locations are significantly outperforming older stores, showing nearly 40% better merchandise margins and 20% more fuel gallons sold in Q1. This strong performance from newly built stores, which are operating \"well above pro forma,\" can help make up for past construction delays. Despite the company being about $20 million behind its 2028 EBITDA target due to these hiccups, the CEO stated the business trajectory will look \"far different in 2028\" as the NTI program ramps up. This suggests that the current view of the company might not fully account for the future profitability driven by these high-performing new stores.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis expansion is part of Murphy's years-long plan, launched in 2023, to open 500 newly built c-stores by 2033. In 2023, Murphy also set a five-year plan to generate $1.3 billion in EBITDA by 2028. The company is currently behind its 2028 EBITDA expectation by approximately $20 million due to previous store construction delays.

This drop came even as DePinto\u2019s salary, which Seven & i calls \u201cfixed compensation,\u201d rose by about $200,000 year over year.\n\nOver 90% of DePinto\u2019s annual earnings result from performance-based incentives \u201cin order to encourage the achievement of performance targets,\u201d Seven & i said in its securities reports.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSeven & i did not specify what the performance-based incentives for DePinto are, nor why his performance-based earnings were so much lower than in fiscal 2023. However, when he earned over $50 million in 2023, DePinto received various \u201clong-term incentives\u201d related to 7-Eleven\u2019s acquisition of 3,800 Speedway c-stores in 2021, according to Seven & i\u2019s securities report.\n\nDePinto was one of several c-store CEOs whose annual earnings dropped in 2024 due to increasingly difficult operating conditions. 7-Eleven, which runs more than 9,300 convenience stores across 41 states, endured significant financial setbacks last year as it faced mounting economic challenges brought on by inflation. The retailer\u2019s same-store sales fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to contract by another 1.5% in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn top of that, 7-Eleven faced frequent organizational disruption during the year, including a takeover attempt by Alimentation Couche-Tard initiated last summer.. Couche-Tard\u2019s bid became the biggest storyline in convenience retailing until the megadeal flopped this month.\n\nIn the middle of dealing with that buyout offer, Seven & i named a new CEO and announced its plans to spin off 7-Eleven into its own company through an initial public offering in the second half of 2026. Days later, DePinto resigned from Seven & i\u2019s board of directors for undisclosed reasons. There\u2019s been no indication that DePinto will step back from his leadership role with 7-Eleven as the company prepares for its IPO.\n\nDespite the decrease from 2023, Depinto\u2019s 4.35 billion yen earned last year still outpaced his 2022 earnings of 3.78 billion yen, or about $25.3 million, according to Seven & i\u2019s securities report from that year.",

This reduction occurred despite a $200,000 increase in his fixed salary. Over 90% of his annual earnings are performance-based, though Seven & i did not specify the reasons for the lower performance-based earnings. In 2023, he received long-term incentives related to the Speedway acquisition.\n\n**Why it matters:** The significant drop in the CEO's performance-based pay reflects increasingly difficult operating conditions and significant financial setbacks for 7-Eleven. The company faced mounting economic challenges due to inflation, resulting in same-store sales declines. This performance challenges any potential consensus view of stable or growing profitability within the convenience store industry, highlighting the impact of current economic pressures on a major player.\n\n**The big picture:** Joseph DePinto has served as 7-Eleven's CEO since 2005, overseeing more than 9,300 stores across 41 states. His compensation decline reflects a broader trend among c-store CEOs facing difficult operating conditions in 2024. Amidst these challenges, 7-Eleven also navigated a takeover attempt by Alimentation Couche-Tard and organizational disruption.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that 2024 was a challenging year for convenience retailers. Not only did the tough operating environment result in less revenue for some of the largest players in the industry, but their CEOs earned less as well.\n\nWhile each company\u2019s situation was unique, convenience retailers across the industry faced many of the same challenges \u2014 from rising building costs and construction delays to hiring and retention woes \u2014 that left retailers in a tight financial spot heading into 2025.\n\nTotal compensation packages for c-store CEOs include various stock- and equity-driven awards that fluctuate considerably. This means an executive can make several millions more \u2014 or less \u2014 in one year than they did the previous, even if their base salary is the same.\n\nLast year, executives from some of the largest publicly traded c-store retailers saw sizable changes in their earnings because of the presence or absence of these incentives.\n\nHere\u2019s how the CEOs at some of the top publicly traded c-store retailers got paid in 2024, according to C-Store Dive\u2019s analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission documents.\n\nJoseph DePinto\n\n7-Eleven\n\n$29.6 million\n\nJoseph DePinto, 7-Eleven\u2019s CEO since 2005, earned 4.34 billion yen, or about $29.6 million in fiscal 2024 \u2014 a notable drop from the $52 million he earned in fiscal 2023, according to parent company Seven & i Holdings\u2019 last two annual securities reports. This drop came even as DePinto\u2019s salary, which Seven & i calls \u201cfixed compensation,\u201d was about $2 million \u2014 higher than the $1.8 million he earned in 2023.\n\nOver 90% of DePinto\u2019s annual earnings result from performance-based incentives \u201cin order to encourage the achievement of performance targets,\u201d Seven & i said in its securities reports.\n\nThe company did not specify why DePinto\u2019s performance-based earnings were so much lower than in fiscal 2023. However, 7-Eleven endured significant financial setbacks last year as it faced mounting economic challenges brought on by inflation. The retailer\u2019s same-store sales fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to contract by another 1.5% in fiscal 2025.\n\nDePinto also resigned from Seven & i\u2019s board of directors in March.\n\nEric Slifka\n\nGlobal Partners LP\n\n$14 million\n\nEric Slifka, Global Partners\u2019 president and CEO since 2005, garnered just over $14 million in fiscal 2024, outpacing the $11 million he earned in 2023, according to the company\u2019s annual 10-K filing.\n\nEric Slifka, Global Partners\u2019 president and CEO since 2005, garnered just over $14 million in fiscal 2024. Retrieved from Global Partners\n\nOn top of his $1.1 million salary \u2014 a $100,000 bump from the previous two years \u2014 Slifka\u2019s 2024 compensation increase largely resulted from various awards and non-equity plan compensation, which brought him a combined $12.8 million. His 2024 payday is a significant bump compared to what he made in the several years before 2023, including $11.5 million in 2022, $6.5 million in 2021 and $5.5 million in 2020.\n\nSlifka, who was also named Global Partners\u2019 chairman earlier this year, helped the company reach $1.1 billion in gross profits during fiscal 2024, a bump from the $974 million it garnered in 2023.\n\nAndrew Clyde\n\nMurphy USA\n\n$11 million\n\nAndrew Clyde, president and CEO of Murphy USA since 2013, saw about a $500,000 bump in his total compensation year over year, reaching just over $11 million in 2024 according to Murphy\u2019s latest proxy statement.\n\nClyde\u2019s total compensation has now surpassed $10 million in three straight years after reaching the figure for the first time in fiscal 2022. The main catalyst for the latest increase came from about $1.5 million more in stock- and option-based awards in 2024 compared to 2023. The $500,000 bump came even as Clyde saw his salary drop by about $13,000 compared to 2023, and in a year in which Murphy saw its full-year revenue drop by about 6%.\n\nWael Sawan\n\nShell plc\n\n$11 million\n\nShell CEO Wael Wawan took home $11 million in fiscal 2024, an increase from the $9.9 million he garnered the year before, according to the company\u2019s annual 20-F filing. Not only was Sawan\u2019s base salary of $1.9 million about 4% higher than in 2023, but Sawan also received about $300,000 more in annual bonuses than the prior year. Sawan\u2019s salary increased once again at the start of 2025 \u2014 by about 5.5%, according to the report.\n\nThese increases came during a year in which Shell\u2019s total cash flow from operations remained essentially unchanged from 2023, but were still lower than in 2022, according to the report. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s board of directors was satisfied with his performance.\n\n\u201cWael Sawan has demonstrated clear and decisive leadership, driving growth where we have a competitive advantage, and making tough decisions to pause and address performance challenges where needed,\u201d Shell said in its 20-F report.\n\nDarren Rebelez\n\nCasey\u2019s General Stores\n\n$10.6 million\n\nDarren Rebelez, president and CEO of Casey\u2019s since 2019 and chairman since 2023, took home nearly the same amount in fiscal 2024 as he did in the previous year \u2014 about $10.6M. Only $19,000 separated the two years, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement. Rebelez saw his salary grow by $50,000 and earned slightly more in stock awards and slightly less in non-equity incentive plan compensation compared to 2023.\n\nAlthough Rebelez\u2019s earnings remained relatively unchanged, he led Casey\u2019s through a year of tremendous growth, spearheading its acquisition of CEFCO Convenience Stores \u2014 the largest deal in company history \u2014 which marked Casey\u2019s entrance into three Southern states.\n\n\n\nWill Monteleone\n\nPar Pacific Holdings\n\n$9.8 million\n\nWill Monteleone, who became CEO of Par Pacific Holdings in April 2024, took home $9.8 million in his first full year leading the convenience retailer, according to the company's latest proxy statement. This marked a significant jump from the $2 million he made in 2023 when he was company president.\n\nA notable portion of Monteleon\u2019s earnings was the more than $6.5 million he made in option awards, according to the report. His promotion came during what Par Pacific called a \u201cchallenging financial year\u201d in which adjusted EBITDA dropped by more than 65%, according to its annual report.\n\nMurray Auchincloss\n\nBP plc\n\n$7.2 million\n\nMurray Auchincloss took home 5.4 million pounds, or about $7.2 million in his first full year as BP\u2019s CEO since succeeding former leader Bernard Looney in January 2024. The executive\u2019s earnings were notably less than in fiscal 2023, as BP experienced what it called \u201ca challenging year operationally,\u201d according to the report. The company saw declines across its customers and products business and axed its green investment strategy amid a major reset.\n\nThat reset has included laying off about 5% of its global workforce and shifting its focus from renewable energy back to oil production. The shift has also impacted BP\u2019s convenience store segments, although it\u2019s unclear to what extent.\n\nAlex Miller\n\nAlimentation Couche-Tard\n\n$6.8 million\n\nCouche-Tard President and CEO Alex Miller took home about CA$9.3 million, or $6.8 million, in his first year as head of the Canadian convenience retailer. Miller assumed leadership of Couche-Tard in September 2024 after longtime exec Brian Hannasch moved into an advisory role that he\u2019ll hold through October 2026. Miller\u2019s earnings were a jump from the CA$5.6 million, or about $4 million, he took home in fiscal 2023 while he was still chief operating officer.\n\nMiller\u2019s salary during the 2024 fiscal year was just over $1 million. The bulk of his earnings came from company share units and stock options, which garnered Miller a combined $5.6 million in the fiscal year. Miller\u2019s $6.8 million earned in fiscal 2024 was only half of what Hannasch made in fiscal 2023.\n\nMiller, who has been with Couche-Tard since 2012, led the convenience retailer through a profitable fiscal year during which its revenues increased by $3.6 billion, or 5.2%, compared with fiscal 2024. A major highlight of Miller\u2019s first year as CEO was the company\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of GetGo Caf\u00e9 + Markets, the convenience store arm of supermarket chain Giant Eagle.\n\nJoseph Kim\n\nSunoco\n\n$6.3 million\n\nJoseph Kim, president and CEO of Sunoco since 2018, garnered $6.3 million in fiscal 2024, a jump from the $5.5 million and $4.9 million he earned in 2023 and 2022, respectively, according to the company\u2019s annual 10-K filing. His salary was over $150,000 higher in 2024 compared to 2023 and he earned hundreds of thousands more in stock awards.\n\nKim notably led Sunoco through one of the biggest c-store deals in recent years when the Texas-based company agreed to acquire Parkland\u2019s assets for over $9 billion. Once the deal closes, The combined company will have an enterprise value of about $25.5 billion and become the largest independent fuel distributor in the Americas.\n\nRobert Espey\n\nParkland Corp.\n\n$6 million\n\nParkland Corp. President and CEO Robert Espey took home $6 million in fiscal 2024, a slight decrease from the $6.2 million he garnered in 2023, according to the company\u2019s latest information circular.\n\nParkland President and CEO Robert Espey earned $6 million in fiscal 2024, a slight decrease from the $6.2 million he garnered in 2023. Retrieved from Parkland\n\nEspey, who\u2019s led Parkland since 2011, is set to leave the company by the end of 2025 \u2014 a move announced during Parkland\u2019s strategic review earlier this year. According to the filing, Espey\u2019s employment was technically terminated on a \u201cwithout cause basis\u201d on April 30, and as part of his agreement to step down, he received a severance of about $5.2 million.\n\nAbout three weeks after Espey\u2019s resignation announcement, Parkland revealed that it agreed to sell its assets to Sunoco.\n\nArie Kotler\n\nArko Corp.\n\n$4.8 million\n\nArie Kotler, president, chairman and CEO of Arko Corp., saw his total earnings dip for the second straight year in fiscal 2024, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement.\n\nDespite seeing his salary rise by 3% in 2024, Kotler\u2019s $4.8 million in earnings was a decrease from the $6 million he garnered in 2023. A notable difference between the two years was that Kotler did not receive any option awards in 2024, compared to the $1.3 million in option awards he earned in 2023, according to the report.\n\nKotler\u2019s decreased earnings came after a challenging year for the company, which saw its merchandise revenue fall by $70.7 million, or 3.8%, and its fuel revenue decrease by $605.5 million, or 8.1%. Kotler told analysts earlier this year that the merchandising drop was largely due to underperforming stores that it closed or converted to dealer sites.\n\nCharles Nifong\n\nCrossAmerica Partners\n\n$1 million\n\nCharles Nifon, president and CEO of CrossAmerica Partners, earned just over $1 million in fiscal 2024, a $144,000 drop from his 2023 earnings, according to the company\u2019s latest 10-K filing.\n\nNifong\u2019s 2024 salary of $500,000 was the same as the prior year, and the difference in his earrings was how much of his target bonus he secured. According to the report, Nifong\u2019s target bonus is 125% of his base salary, or $625,000, and he took home $223,500 of that amount in 2024 compared to over $371,000 in 2023. The report notes that Nifong\u2019s bonus payout depends on CrossAmerica \u201cbeing financially efficient\u201d and \"maximizing operational excellence\u201d in its retail and wholesale operations.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Convenience Retail CEOs See Mixed Pay Amid Challenging 2024\n\n**Key details:**\nThe article details 2024 total compensation for CEOs of major publicly traded convenience retailers. Executives like 7-Eleven's Joseph DePinto saw significant pay drops, while others such as Global Partners' Eric Slifka experienced increases. Compensation often fluctuates based on performance-based incentives, stock, and equity awards, rather than just base salary. These changes occurred amid a challenging year for the industry due to various economic pressures.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe variance in CEO compensation highlights the diverse performance across convenience retailers despite a universally challenging operating environment in 2024. Some CEOs received more pay even as their companies faced revenue drops or stable cash flow, while others saw compensation decrease alongside financial setbacks. This directly challenges any simple consensus view that all convenience retailers experienced uniform financial outcomes or that executive pay directly correlates with immediate company-wide revenue declines. It indicates that specific strategic moves like acquisitions or operational shifts, as well as individual company performance metrics, played a significant role in executive incentives and overall outcomes.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe convenience retail sector experienced a tough operating environment in 2024, leading to reduced revenue for some major players. Industry-wide challenges included rising building costs, construction delays, and difficulties with hiring and retention. Executive compensation packages, heavily reliant on stock and equity awards, are highly variable year-to-year. This variability allows for millions more or less in earnings even with a consistent base salary.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Joseph DePinto (7-Eleven): $29.6 million in 2024, a drop from $52 million in 2023.\n*   7-Eleven's same-store sales fell 2.7% in fiscal 2024.\n*   Eric Slifka (Global Partners): $14 million in 2024, up from $11 million in 2023.\n*   Global Partners reached $1.1 billion in gross profits during fiscal 2024.\n*   Sunoco's acquisition of Parkland's assets is for over $9 billion.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Joseph DePinto (7-Eleven):** CEO whose pay significantly dropped due to company's same-store sales decline.\n*   **Eric Slifka (Global Partners LP):** CEO whose compensation increased, reflecting the company's improved gross profits.\n*   **Joseph Kim (Sunoco):** CEO leading the company's major acquisition of Parkland's assets.\n*   **Alex Miller (Alimentation Couche-Tard):** New CEO who led the company through a profitable year and key acquisition.\n*   **Robert Espey (Parkland Corp.):** CEO whose departure coincides with the company's agreement to sell assets.\n*   **Sunoco:** Company agreeing to acquire Parkland's assets for over $9 billion.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Sunoco-Parkland asset acquisition is expected to close, forming a combined enterprise valued at $25.5 billion.\n*   Parkland Corp. President and CEO Robert Espey is set to leave the company by the end of 2025.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nCEO pay reflects varied industry performance, deals, not just challenging environment.",

        "summary_text": "Citi\u2019s commercial bank is jumping on chances to serve as a consolidator of banking services for clients that have incrementally built a global presence.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Tasnim Ghiawadwala, global head of the lender\u2019s commercial bank, who pointed to a client with $1 billion in annual sales, operating in 60 markets, that\u2019s dealing with 72 banks. That\u2019s the type of opportunity Citi aims to capitalize on, leaning on its global reach.\n\nFor mid-size companies, that situation \u201chappens sort of organically,\u201d she said. Early on, commercial clients aren\u2019t thinking from a global perspective. But smaller companies are taking an increasingly global posture, and as they rack up bank partners in multiple markets, it can \u201ccarry a huge amount of cost, to maintain such a large banking group,\u201d she said.\n\nTasnim Ghiawadwala Permission granted by Citi\n\nWith many companies finding themselves in that situation, \u201cI have no doubt about our ability to grow in this space,\u201d Ghiawadwala said. The New York-based lender maintained its global network \u2013 the bank\u2019s \u201cbiggest competitive advantage\u201d \u2013 when others with global ambitions retracted following the 2007-08 financial crisis, she noted.\n\nSimplifying banking could mean assisting in some or all of the countries where clients operate or structuring their liquidity needs more efficiently, she said. \u201cIn some instances, it makes sense for the client to use a local or regional bank for their needs and in other markets it makes more sense to use Citi instead,\u201d she said.\n\nServing in the consolidator role is \u201can opportunity for us to help them with harmonizing their banking relationships and centralizing their financial operations to have better visibility, increased access and ultimately generate efficiencies,\u201d she said.\n\nCiti has brought its commercial bank to several new markets over the last five years, including Western Europe, Canada and Japan. In the U.S., the commercial bank operates in 17 markets to cover top business hubs, although it works with clients across the country.\n\nCiti doesn\u2019t disclose the size of the commercial business, although Ghiawadwala said it\u2019s a \u201cdecent part\u201d of Citi\u2019s banking segment. Citi\u2019s banking revenues rose 18% in the second quarter, to $1.9 billion, although that also includes investment banking and corporate lending.\n\nThe lender is working to draw in new mid-sized corporate clients and do more for its current roster, she said. Growing the commercial client segment is one of Citi\u2019s main priorities this year and next.\n\nWhen asked about the size of the opportunity envisioned, the bank pointed to Ghiawadwala\u2019s comments from 2022, when she told investors the bank is focused on an addressable opportunity of about $150 billion; the bank\u2019s share of that was about 2% in 2022, and she said the bank sought to double that share.\n\n\u201cEven our existing clients are growing, and so, as they grow, their banking needs are changing,\u201d Ghiawadwala noted in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s really a lot for us to do in terms of absolutely realizing our full potential.\u201d\n\nThe lender has bankers on the ground in 90 countries, and a global relationship manager oversees a client\u2019s entire reach across various markets, she said. Commercial clients do between $10 million to $3 billion in sales annually, with the \u201csweet spot\u201d being companies already operating in a few countries that are looking for a global bank, she said.\n\nThe bank counted 14,000 commercial clients in 2022; Citi declined to share a current number. The lender focuses on six \u201csuper sectors\u201d: industrials, digital technology and communications, retail, healthcare, business and professional services, and nonbank financial institutions.\n\nCiti aims to serve clients\u2019 everyday banking needs and as a strategic partner when it comes to investments and guidance. About 90% of clients are privately held businesses, and Citi aims to tap different parts of the bank when needed, such as if clients are looking to go public, Ghiawadwala said.\n\nThese mid-sized corporate customers particularly appreciate consumer-like capabilities in banking, because they\u2019re companies that don\u2019t have as much formal structure or lack big treasury or finance teams, she said.\n\nTreasury management, for example, isn\u2019t something companies tend to consider at the outset. As firms go through growing pains, \u201cthat\u2019s where we can kind of come in and bring our large company experience,\u201d Ghiawadwala said.\n\nCiti has sought to simplify functions for clients \u2013 thinking through the number of clicks it takes to handle a task, or what web menus look like \u2013 while providing robust capabilities that some of the world\u2019s largest companies turn to the bank for.\n\nThe bank unified functions through a new platform, introduced in 2023, that provides a single digital user interface. Last month, the bank added a digital credit application capability for smaller loans and an automated self-service credit management process, which allows Citi to monitor covenance without having to reach out to remind clients for information.\n\nIn the markets that have added those tools, about 20% of commercial clients are using its digital lending capabilities, the bank said.\n\nCiti is also working to digitize banker tasks, with the bank\u2019s artificial intelligence-powered assistant Stylus, to bolster productivity when it comes to generating reports and other duties. A heatmap tool, rolled out earlier this year, helps bankers identify geographic locations clients operate in, as bankers consider products that would be beneficial, Ghiawadwala said.",

The report also urged Congress to draft legislation granting the CFTC authority to regulate spot markets in non-security digital assets, something a bill introduced by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, and Cynthia Lummis, R-WY, in 2022 aimed to do.\n\nThe group also said federal banking regulators \u2013 the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and National Credit Union Administration \u2013 \u201cshould never again pursue the Biden Administration\u2019s policies of Operation Choke Point 2.0 and should instead embrace the opportunities digital assets and blockchain technologies offer to banks nationwide.\u201d That referred to an alleged coordinated regulatory effort by the Biden administration to undercut the crypto industry by blocking it out of the banking system.\n\nBanking regulators should ensure risk management guidance is technology-neutral, and should relaunch efforts to provide clarity on activities banks want to pursue, the report said.\n\n\u201cTo support these efforts, the United States should adopt capital requirements for bank digital asset activities that accurately reflect the risk of the asset or activity,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe relevant federal banking regulators should provide clarity and transparency regarding the process for eligible institutions to obtain a bank charter or a Reserve Bank master account.\u201d\n\nCrypto-focused bank Custodia tried and failed to obtain a Reserve Bank master account.

It called on the SEC and CFTC to legalize federal cryptocurrency trading and asked Congress to grant CFTC authority over non-security digital asset spot markets. The report also advised federal banking regulators to cease \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\" policies. It urged banks to embrace digital assets and provide clarity on activities, along with technology-neutral risk management. The group recommended capital requirements for bank digital asset activities and clearer processes for bank charters.\n\n**Why it matters:** This report aims to move towards \"the new American Golden Age\" for digital assets. It directly challenges the alleged \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\" policies, which supposedly blocked the crypto industry from the banking system. The working group's call for regulators to embrace digital assets signals a potential shift from prior restrictive approaches. This push for clearer rules and banking access could unlock significant opportunities for the industry. It challenges the current consensus of regulatory uncertainty and banking exclusion.\n\n**The big picture:** The digital asset industry has been operating without clear federal rules for registration, custody, and trading. Previous legislative efforts, such as a 2022 bill by Sens. Gillibrand and Lummis, sought to grant the CFTC authority over non-security spot markets.

        "summary_text": "Wells Fargo intends to give CEO Charlie Scharf a $30 million one-time equity award and install him as chair of its board, in addition to serving as chief executive, the bank announced Thursday.\n\nThe move is meant to lock Scharf into leading Wells for the next six years and recognize his role in restoring the bank\u2019s reputation, boosting its risk and control infrastructure, and identifying and investing in \u201ccore\u201d business areas.\n\nRegulators have terminated 13 consent orders against Wells since Scharf became CEO in 2019, including a $1.95 trillion asset cap the Federal Reserve lifted in June \u2013 a remnant of the bank\u2019s 2016 fake-accounts scandal.\n\nWells did not give a timeline for handing the chair role to Scharf \u2013 nor did it detail a future role for the bank\u2019s current chair, Steven Black. The bank did, however, note that it intends to appoint a lead independent director. Scharf and Black have served together before; Black was a director on BNY\u2019s board when Scharf served as chair and CEO of the bank in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to recognize Charlie's significant contributions to Wells Fargo,\u201d Black said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to Charlie\u2019s continued guidance and strategic direction as we navigate the future.\"\n\nDepending on the timing, Wells could become the third U.S.-based systemically important financial institution to combine its chair and CEO roles this year. BNY in June named CEO Robin Vince to concurrently serve as its chair, starting Sept. 1. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick assumed chair responsibilities Jan. 1. That leaves Citi as the only U.S. SIFI (there are eight) to maintain separate chair and CEO roles.\n\nScharf would also become at least the third CEO of a top-10 U.S. bank this year to receive an eight-figure equity award. Goldman Sachs disclosed in January that it would give CEO David Solomon an $80 million retention bonus. The bank gave the same deal to President John Waldron, drawing criticism from proxy advisers this spring. Capital One, meanwhile, granted CEO Richard Fairbank a $30 million one-time award in June after the bank closed its long-running acquisition of Discover.\n\nScharf\u2019s award is not limited to $30 million in restricted share rights. He also is set to receive 1,046,000 stock options. The award will vest on a pro rata basis following the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the grant date. Unvested portions of the award will be forfeited if Scharf resigns or retires earlier, the bank said. Also, Scharf must keep at least 50% of the vested shares throughout his time at Wells and a year after he leaves, according to the bank.\n\nScharf, in a statement Thursday, largely deferred to his team.\n\n\u201cOver the last several years, our Operating Committee and our 213,000 employees have executed a multi-faceted transformation under extremely difficult circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a privilege to lead Wells Fargo and our talented and dedicated team, and I look forward to building on our significant momentum to continue improving our performance and market position in everything we do.\u201d\n\nThe award further stabilizes leadership at Wells and removes any incentive Scharf might have to explore options outside of the bank. Observers have casually speculated that Scharf could have been a dark-horse candidate to succeed mentor Jamie Dimon as CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Dimon has hinted that the clock is ticking on his tenure atop the bank, and a series of personnel moves \u2013 first in 2021, then last year and again this year (twice) \u2013 has alternately raised the profiles of various potential internal successors.\n\nThe value of Scharf\u2019s award will fluctuate along with Wells\u2019 stock price, the bank said. The options, for their part, will only have value insofar as the bank\u2019s stock price appreciates throughout the vesting period.\n\nScharf wasn\u2019t the only Wells executive whose compensation came under the microscope. Wells\u2019 human resources committee decided not to keep a target total compensation structure for its named executive officers, the bank said Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The panel, rather, will \u201cdetermine incentive compensation for each NEO, including the CEO, using a holistic performance assessment that evaluates NEO performance based on individual and Company performance, as well as line of business performance, where applicable, relative to established financial and non-financial performance criteria,\u201d the bank said.\n\nScharf will be Wells\u2019 first CEO-chair hybrid in nearly a decade. The bank changed its bylaws after former Chair and CEO John Stumpf resigned in October 2016, to require an independent chair. Wells amended those bylaws this week to allow Scharf to serve in a dual capacity. Another new amendment requires the bank to maintain an independent lead director.",

This move is designed to lock Scharf into leading the bank for the next six years. His compensation package includes 1,046,000 stock options, which will vest on a pro rata basis over four, five, and six years. The bank also amended its bylaws this week to allow for a combined CEO and chair role, the first in nearly a decade. Wells Fargo intends to appoint a lead independent director.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe bank's decision to combine the CEO and chair roles challenges its prior governance structure, which required an independent chair after the 2016 fake-accounts scandal. This move places Wells among a growing trend, as it could become the third U.S.-based systemically important financial institution this year to adopt a combined leadership model. The substantial equity award is designed to lock Scharf into leading Wells, removing speculation he might seek other top roles, like at JPMorgan Chase. This signals strong board confidence in Scharf's leadership, aiming to stabilize the bank and build on recent regulatory progress.\n\n**The big picture:**\nWells Fargo is recognizing CEO Charlie Scharf for his work in restoring the bank's reputation and improving its risk and control infrastructure since he became CEO in 2019. Under his leadership, regulators have terminated 13 consent orders, including the Federal Reserve's $1.95 trillion asset cap, a lingering issue from the 2016 fake-accounts scandal. This decision aligns Wells Fargo with a trend among other major U.S. banks, as BNY and Morgan Stanley have also recently combined their CEO and chair roles. The award package, including restricted shares and stock options, is similar to other eight-figure CEO equity awards seen this year at top U.S. banks.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$30 million:** One-time equity award for CEO Charlie Scharf.\n*   **6 years:** Intended duration Scharf will lead Wells Fargo.\n*   **1,046,000:** Number of stock options Scharf is set to receive.\n*   **13:** Number of consent orders regulators have terminated against Wells since Scharf became CEO.\n*   **$1.95 trillion:** Asset cap lifted by the Federal Reserve in June.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Bank awarding its CEO a significant equity package and combining his leadership roles.\n*   **Charlie Scharf:** Current CEO of Wells Fargo, set to receive a $30 million award and become chair.\n*   **Steven Black:** Current chair of Wells Fargo's board, who endorsed Scharf's new combined role.\n*   **BNY:** Bank where Scharf and Black previously served; recently combined CEO and chair roles.\n*   **Morgan Stanley:** Another U.S. SIFI that combined its CEO and chair responsibilities this year.\n*   **Goldman Sachs:** Bank that awarded its CEO an $80 million retention bonus earlier this year.\n*   **Capital One:** Bank that granted its CEO a $30 million award after a recent acquisition.\n*   **Jamie Dimon:** CEO of JPMorgan Chase, whom Scharf was casually speculated to succeed.\n*   **John Stumpf:** Former Wells Fargo CEO and Chair, whose resignation led to prior bylaw changes.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The appointment of a lead independent director, as the bank intends to do.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWells Fargo solidifies leadership with major CEO award and dual role.",

The direct relationship with JPMorgan and fintechs could allow the latter to bypass traditional aggregators like Plaid and MX Technologies.\n\nCrypto billionaire Tyler Winklevoss has publicly opposed the policy and later said JPMorgan paused onboarding his crypto exchange Gemini in retaliation for his criticism, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn a recent note to Feldsher, a JPMorgan systems employee wrote in an internal memo that aggregators are accessing customer data several times a day, even when the customer is not actively using the app, thereby \u201cmassively taxing\u201d the lender\u2019s systems, CNBC reported.\n\nThe gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance is narrowing in 2025, driven by relaxed regulatory oversight and a push for comprehensive federal cryptocurrency legislation, as evidenced by the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month.\n\nSeveral significant partnerships between traditional banks and crypto companies have emerged recently, such as BNY\u2019s announcement that it will custody reserves for Ripple's new stablecoin, Ripple USD.

The hyperscaler increased revenue 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion in Q2 and reported nearly $108 billion in 2024 revenue, a 19% increase over the prior year.\n\nMicrosoft, by comparison, saw Azure cloud revenue spike 34% to $75 billion during its most recent fiscal year. The company had not previously reported Azure financials separately from other services bundled in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Google Cloud, which experienced its first profitable quarter more than two years ago, grew its annual revenue 31% to $43.4 billion in 2024.\n\nWhile the rapid rise of large language model technologies didn\u2019t shuffle the standings in Q2, generative AI adoption continued to stoke demand for cloud. Global spend on cloud services increased nearly 25% to $99 billion during the three-month period, driven by triple-digit growth in cloud-based AI, according to a Thursday Synergy Research Group report. AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud split the lion\u2019s share of cloud spend, commanding 30%, 20% and 13% of the market, respectively.\n\n\u201cTake a bow Gen AI, which has lit a fire under cloud service development and helped to propel the market to new highs,\u201d SRG Chief Analyst John Dinsdale said in an email. \u201cWe saw growth of 140-180% in Gen AI-specific cloud services, and AI is also contributing to enhancements and added growth across the broader portfolio of cloud services.\u201d\n\nThe trend triggered an ongoing hyperscale race to add capacity. Amazon led the pack, committing $100 billion to capital investments in cloud infrastructure this year. The company piled $31.4 billion in Q2 investments on top of the nearly $25 billion it spent in the first quarter and expects CapEx to remain at that level through the back half of the year, according to CFO Brian Olsavsky.\n\n\u201cWe have more demand than we have capacity at this point,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cWe will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI.\u201d\n\nAWS is steadily adding to its stockpile of AI capabilities. The company deployed AI agent-building platform AgentCore along with coding assistant agent Kiro last month, and rolled out open-source AI agent developer tool Strands Agents in May.\n\nAWS\u2019 backlog cloud business has grown in step with AI adoption, increasing year-over-year by 25% to $195 billion, according to Jassy, who said he expects capacity constraints to ease gradually over the next several quarters.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest constraint is power,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cYou also see constraints off and on with chips \u2026 I think it will take several quarters, but I do expect it's going to get better each quarter.\u201d",

Jassy also referenced Microsoft's recent cyber issues, emphasizing AWS's different security results. AWS Q2 revenue grew 17.5% to $30.9 billion, with backlog cloud business up 25% to $195 billion. Amazon is committing $100 billion to cloud infrastructure this year, spending $31.4 billion in Q2. Capacity constraints, mainly power and chips, are a current challenge, expected to ease over quarters.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis signals Amazon's aggressive strategy to maintain AWS's leading market share in the booming cloud sector, especially fueled by generative AI. The significant capital investment commitment ($100 billion) underscores the company's intent to capture massive AI-driven demand. Jassy's direct comments on Microsoft's cyber issues challenge a perception of uniform security robustness among top cloud providers.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft received a stern rebuke from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Thursday after a banner year for its cloud division. Azure cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year to more than $75 billion in the 12 months ending June 30, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings release.\n\nCompetition in the UK cloud market is \u201cnot working well,\u201d the CMA said in its final decision, which singled out Microsoft\u2019s software licensing practices for \u201cadversely impacting the competitiveness of AWS and Google in the supply of cloud services.\u201d The market watchdog recommended actions that would \u201cimpose targeted and bespoke interventions\u201d to remedy the situation.\n\nMicrosoft reiterated objections raised in a February response to the investigation. \u201cThe CMA Panel\u2019s most recent publication misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cMicrosoft looks forward to working with the Digital Markets Unit toward an outcome that more accurately reflects the current competition in cloud.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMicrosoft is one of three U.S. cloud superpowers that together dominate nearly two-thirds of the global market for infrastructure services. AWS leads with 29% of the market, followed by Microsoft and Google Cloud, whose shares are 22% and 12% respectively, according to Synergy Research Group May analysis.\n\nIn Europe, the trio's combined footprint is even larger proportionally, swallowing up 70% of the region\u2019s $70 billion in cloud spend last year, Synergy Research Group data show. Europe-based providers saw their collective share contract from 29% in 2017 to its current level of 15% in 2022, the analyst firm said in a July report.\n\nA surge in demand for cloud services, driven by AI adoption and ongoing workload migrations, sparked a hyperscaler building boom that has yet to subside.\n\nMicrosoft alone committed $80 billion to capital investments in its 2025 fiscal year and spent $24.2 billion during the final quarter, which included more than $17 billion on property, plants and equipment, EVP and CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The company expects CapEx to exceed $30 billion in the next quarter to satisfy escalating demand.\n\n\u201cEven as we continue bringing more datacenter capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWe have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud.\u201d\n\nAzure\u2019s growth spurt helped the cloud unit deliver more than one-quarter of Microsoft\u2019s $281 billion in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year. Intelligent Cloud, the larger division encompassing Azure, accounted for $106 billion or over one-third of the company\u2019s revenue for the 12-month period.\n\nLarge customers helped drive Azure\u2019s expansions, Nadella said, pointing to food and beverage behemoth Nestl\u00e9, which shuttered six aging data centers through a massive migration of over 200 SAP instances and 10,000-plus servers.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot, the generative AI chatbot embedded in the company\u2019s cloud-based office productivity suite, also contributed to the cloud usage surge. The company added two sales-focused AI agents to the Copilot family in March and added a pay-as-you-go Copilot plan at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cCustomers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite,\u201d Nadella said, citing Barclays\u2019 plan to equip 100,000 employees with the tool after an initial deployment to 15,000 colleagues.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** UK Regulator Rebukes Microsoft Over Cloud Market Licensing Practices\n\n**Key details:** The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) rebuked Microsoft, citing its software licensing practices for adversely impacting cloud market competition for AWS and Google. The CMA called for targeted interventions, stating the UK cloud market is \"not working well.\" Microsoft objected, arguing the cloud market is dynamic and competitive with AI-driven changes. Despite regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft's Azure cloud services revenue grew 34% year over year to over $75 billion in FY25. The company also announced significant capital expenditures, expecting to remain capacity constrained through early fiscal year 2026.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters because a major regulator is directly challenging Microsoft's software licensing practices in the highly lucrative cloud market. The CMA's finding that competition is \"not working well\" contradicts Microsoft's assertion of a dynamic and competitive market. Potential \"targeted interventions\" could impact Microsoft's revenue streams or market share in the UK and potentially Europe. This regulatory scrutiny poses a significant challenge to the current consensus of unchecked growth and dominance for major cloud providers. It suggests that government bodies may increasingly intervene to reshape the competitive landscape.\n\n**The big picture:** Three U.S. cloud \"superpowers\" \u2014 AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud \u2014 collectively dominate nearly two-thirds of the global market for infrastructure services. Their combined market share is even higher in Europe, consuming 70% of the region's cloud spending. This dominance has come at the expense of Europe-based providers, whose market share has significantly contracted. The broader cloud market is experiencing a surge in demand, fueled by AI adoption and ongoing workload migrations, leading to a sustained hyperscaler building boom.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Azure cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year to over $75 billion.\n*   Microsoft committed $80 billion to capital investments in its 2025 fiscal year.\n*   Microsoft expects capital expenditures to exceed $30 billion in the next quarter.\n*   The company has $368 billion of contracted backlog.\n*   Microsoft holds 22% of the global market for infrastructure services.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Microsoft:** Major cloud provider rebuked by UK regulator for anti-competitive licensing practices despite strong growth.\n*   **U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA):** UK market watchdog that issued a stern rebuke to Microsoft over cloud market competition.\n*   **Satya Nadella:** Microsoft Chairman and CEO, announced cloud revenue figures and customer adoption for Azure.\n*   **Amy Hood:** Microsoft EVP and CFO, discussed capital investments, spending, and future capacity constraints.\n*   **AWS:** Cloud service identified by CMA as negatively impacted by Microsoft's software licensing practices.\n*   **Google:** Cloud provider identified by CMA as adversely impacted by Microsoft's software licensing practices.\n*   **Synergy Research Group:** Analyst firm providing data on global and European cloud market shares and trends.\n*   **Digital Markets Unit:** Entity Microsoft hopes to collaborate with for an outcome reflecting cloud competition.\n*   **Nestl\u00e9:** Large food and beverage company cited as a major customer driving Azure cloud expansions.\n*   **Barclays:** Financial institution planning large-scale deployment of Microsoft 365 Copilot for its employees.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Microsoft plans to work with the Digital Markets Unit on an outcome regarding cloud market competition.\n*   Microsoft expects to remain capacity constrained through the first half of its fiscal year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Regulatory headwinds emerge for Microsoft's booming cloud business in the UK.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSince CIO Dive's inaugural newsletter went live to the world in July 2015, the evolution of IT has thrust the CIO closer to enterprise decision-making.\n\nBuoyed by the star power of digital capabilities, CIOs helped their companies bridge the gap between technological innovation and the favorable business outcomes it enables, gaining C-suite influence along the way.\n\nFor PagerDuty CIO Eric Johnson, who spent the past decade serving as CIO across multiple companies, the broad enterprise move toward the cloud proved integral to the changes.\n\n\"Looking back, I felt like there were a lot of things we wanted to do, but sometimes the tech hadn't quite caught up,\" said Johnson, who in 2015 was serving as CIO for software company DocuSign. \"CIOs were starting to come out of the back office. They were starting to get more exposure and more opportunity to work with go-to-market teams, and starting to have a better voice as executives in the business.\"\n\nAlongside an ongoing push to embrace the cloud, the ecosystem of software providers swelled with SaaS offerings during the 2010s, challenging tech chiefs to navigate a complex environment.\n\n\"As a CIO, you were no longer in control of the infrastructure,\" said Merim Becirovic, CIO at Boston Consulting Group. \"Up until that point, that was the norm in most organizations.\"\n\nThough at times critics called for the demise of the role, CIOs spent the past decade owning digital operations, guiding organizations through waves of technology change and leaping to respond to multiple crises \u2014 including an overnight move to remote work in 2020. Now, they continue to steer their businesses into uncharted waters as AI seeps into more parts of every organization.\n\nCIOs and the C-suite\n\nIT innovations led to a closer relationship between CIOs and their C-suite counterparts. The shift was driven in part by greater boardroom awareness of technology's role.\n\n\"While a CIO still needs to do some education, the acumen of the C-suite has been increasing,\" said Gartner Distinguished VP Analyst Christie Struckman. \"They now have much more savvy partners that they need to talk to, so that becomes a different seat at the table.\"\n\nThe increase in tech savviness has elevated the boardroom view of the CIO. CEOs rank CIOs and chief technology officers among the most effective leaders in the C-suite, according to PwC data published last year.\n\nWith back-of-house tasks like data center management increasingly out of their purview, and more mature tools in the IT toolkit, CIOs spent more time connecting technology to core business areas.\n\n\"By the time 2019 rolled around, I really felt like there was no debate: the CIO is absolutely a key business partner across the organization and, in many times, even proactively leading and driving business initiatives,\" Johnson said.\n\nPartnership across the organization has remained a key theme for CIOs. A Gartner survey of over 2,500 CIOs published in October 2023 found more than half are running technology through an \"operator mindset,\" in which they retain digital delivery responsibility but partner with CxOs on digital initiatives.\n\nIn another sign of the more direct link with core business operations, the top outcome for CIOs is to improve customer or citizen experiences, according to more than 3 in 5 respondents.\n\n\u201cBusiness acumen has become table stakes,\u201d Struckman said of CIOs involved in external-facing aspects of the business.\n\nThe new frontier\n\nWith AI taking over the technology agenda, the clear challenge ahead for CIOs is to remain trusted advisors for their organizations, helping beat back vendor hype while supporting deep transformations in how companies work.\n\n\"As I reflect on conversations with peers and the evolution of this role, it\u2019s clear CIOs are taking on broader responsibility for enterprise capability building, especially in areas like data and AI,\" Principal Financial Group EVP and CIO Kathy Kay said in an email.\n\nEmbedding AI across organizations is a process CIOs are deeply involved in, as CEOs pursue AI-driven revenue gains.\n\n\"The ability to effectively use and manage generative AI models will become the primary measure of value and success for CIOs,\" Sinclair Schuller, EY Americas Responsible AI Leader, told CIO Dive. \"Additionally, the CIO will play a pivotal role in rolling out AI for all employees, guiding human-AI collaboration to ensure success while avoiding introducing significant risk to their organization.\"\n\nThough data woes, skill shortages and other AI-related concerns swell, CIOs \u2014 it seems \u2014 are up for the challenge.\n\n\"This is the most exciting time to be a CIO,\" Johnson said. \"I can't think of a time where we've had that much influence, that much responsibility, and we've been that important to a company's long-term success.\"",

Over half of CIOs operate with an \"operator mindset,\" partnering with CxOs on digital initiatives. Improving customer or citizen experiences is the top outcome for more than 3 in 5 respondents. AI is the new frontier, requiring CIOs to be trusted advisors and take on broader responsibility for enterprise capability building, especially in data and AI.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe elevated boardroom view of the CIO signals a significant shift in enterprise strategy. CEOs now rank CIOs and chief technology officers among the most effective C-suite leaders, challenging any prior consensus viewing them as solely back-office functions. This new strategic prominence means technology leadership is deeply integrated into core business, impacting innovation and growth.

The integration is available to PNC corporate and commercial banking clients via the Oracle B2B marketplace in the technology provider\u2019s cloud-based ERP, PNC said in the announcement.\n\nThe platform, launched by PNC Treasury Management in 2021, is designed to ease payment, reconciliation and balance retrieval functions and automate financial management processes, PNC said. The integration joins embedded offerings from HSBC, JPMorgan and Mastercard in the ERP marketplace, which Oracle rolled out in 2022.\n\n\u201cBy embedding our services within Oracle Cloud ERP, our clients can more effectively manage their cash position and spend more time running their businesses, while spending less time establishing bank connectivity and handling manual financial tasks,\u201d Howard Forman, EVP and head of PNC's Commercial Digital Channels, said in the release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nERP systems sit at the heart of the enterprise, circulating critical financial and operational data across an organization\u2019s core business functions. Cloud adoption helped expand ERP capabilities and efforts to wrest value from generative AI tools have now intensified the focus on enterprise data.\n\nOracle\u2019s growing cloud ambitions are built on integrating data systems and activating AI.

JPMorgan was on board for the launch of B2B three years ago, tying its banking, travel card and expense services into Oracle Fusion ERP. The firm added its trade and working capital finance platforms to the package last year.\n\nOracle further extended its reach into finance earlier this year through a multiyear cloud modernization pact with Lloyds Banking Group. The deal includes Oracle database deployments in Microsoft Azure data centers.\n\n\u201cFew sectors are evolving as rapidly as the financial services industry when it comes to cloud adoption,\u201d Richard Smith, EVP and general manager, EMEA Cloud Infrastructure at Oracle, said in the announcement.\n\nAs AI adoption moved into the agentic automation stage earlier this year, Oracle installed an AI production suite in its cloud ERP. The company brought additional agent customization tools on line in April as a separately priced Oracle Fusion offering.\n\nThe Fusion ERP suite currently has more than 10,000 customers, according to Oracle.",

Pinacle Connect, launched by PNC Treasury Management in 2021, aims to ease payment, reconciliation, and balance retrieval functions while automating financial management processes. This offering joins existing embedded services from HSBC, JPMorgan, and Mastercard in Oracle's ERP marketplace, which was rolled out in 2022.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBy embedding treasury services directly within Oracle Cloud ERP, PNC's clients can more effectively manage their cash position and reduce time spent on manual financial tasks and establishing bank connectivity.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs the finance chief of the Institute of Internal Auditors, Ann Cohen has spent a decade navigating a role and an industry that has grown increasingly complex.\n\nFrom geopolitical risks to ESG expectations and the acceleration of digital transformation, she has watched the role of the CFO evolve alongside the audit function it supports. The IIA, whose members include nearly 200,000 certified internal auditors across 170 countries, sets internal audit standards, provides certifications and offers training and research opportunities for those working in internal audit.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, Cohen reflects on how audit quality has changed, the growing demands on internal audit teams and how members of her organization are thinking about the role of emerging technologies like agentic AI in the audit function.\n\nCohen also discusses what\u2019s kept her around for a decade, why strong internal audit relationships are critical and her perspective on issues shaping the profession \u2014 from the 150-hour CPA requirement to the skills and mindsets that define successful finance chiefs.\n\nAnn Cohen\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Ann Cohen\n\nCFO, Institute of Internal Auditors\n\nFirst CFO position: 2005\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nWoodfield Country Club\n\nBainbridge Companies\n\nTaylor Woodrow Developments\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nADAM ZAKI: Now that you\u2019re in your 10th year in the CFO seat at the IIA, what would you say has changed most about your role since you started?\n\nANN COHEN: Life as a CFO has just become so much more complex. The world has changed. Just look at the difference between the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic environments, for example. For my peers and me, factors like geopolitical risk, ESG expectations, new regulations and digital transformation have all added layers of complexity. And they\u2019re still evolving.\n\nAI is a great example. These emerging risks have made it a much more dynamic and difficult world to operate in. As a result, the audit process itself has become more complicated. We\u2019ve heard directly from our members, concerns such as \u2018Our auditors are struggling\u2019 or \u2018Why is this harder than it used to be?\u2019 The audit process itself is more difficult now.\n\nThe way audit has changed \u2014 how we work with people, how we access information, how we report \u2014 continues to evolve. To be effective, internal auditors now need to understand operations deeply. They need awareness of geopolitical factors, the ability to evaluate evolving risks and a strong grasp of internal controls. That level of insight takes work. It\u2019s a major challenge that makes what I do here really interesting.\n\nWhen you're developing global standards, how do you ensure they stay practical over time?\n\nWe stay close to our stakeholders \u2014 our National Institutes, global network, sponsors and regulators. We\u2019re constantly in listening mode: What\u2019s going on in your environment? What\u2019s shifting geopolitically? What risks are emerging in your region? Through advocacy and direct engagement, we keep a pulse on global developments. That helps us make sure our standards stay current and relevant.\n\nInternally, how does your audit oversight process work?\n\nWe have a chief audit executive who reports to our CEO, which is the standard structure in our profession. It\u2019s important they don\u2019t report to me as CFO because that could create a conflict; after all, they\u2019re auditing areas under my responsibility.\n\nThat said, we work very closely together. I see our internal audit leader as a strategic partner. We regularly collaborate on identifying risks, evaluating controls and improving our processes. She was actually in my office earlier today to talk about some IT-related topics. We\u2019re in constant contact.\n\nWhat do you think makes a healthy relationship between a CFO and their internal audit team?\n\nTransparency and trust are key. You have to be open and honest with one another. When the internal audit function identifies a finding, CFOs must ask questions \u2014 what they saw, how they found it, what their thinking was. But it\u2019s always from a place of curiosity, not defensiveness. That dynamic only works when both parties trust each other as true strategic partners.\n\nWhat is your role in developing the talent around your internal audit function?\n\nOur internal audit function works across the entire organization. So that means not just with me, but with our certification, membership and learning teams too. They provide insights into how operations are running, where control weaknesses might exist, and how risks are shifting. They also work closely with our risk manager to align on strategy. Everyone has their own strategic plan, and internal audit plays a critical role in helping us meet those goals.\n\nCan you provide details on how you and your members are talking about the role of agentic AI in audit?\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, there\u2019s definitely interest in using agentic AI. But right now, things are changing so fast. Everyone is trying to wrap their heads around what it means and how it will evolve. There\u2019s risk involved, like with all digital transformation, and the pace of change is dizzying.\n\nI read about it every day, and even then, it\u2019s hard to keep up. I can tell you that people are asking, \u2018When will this settle enough that we can implement it in a sustainable way? Where does it make sense for our organization? What will it cost?\u2019 Everyone wants to get there, but it\u2019s going to take time.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding the 150-hour CPA licensure requirement changes? Do you think it\u2019s lowering standards or removing an unnecessary boundary?\n\nThere are some valid points on both sides, but the changes' impact will likely not be as noticeable as if public accounting\u2019s other major issue were addressed.\n\nThe one piece we can\u2019t ignore is compensation. Aspiring CPAs need to be fairly compensated. When they graduate from college, they should be earning competitive salaries \u2014 comparable to other industries that may or may not require less schooling.\n\nWhether states keep or drop the 150-hour rule, we have to make accounting a competitive and attractive career path for all, and I think that conversation needs to be geared more towards compensation for those working in entry-level accounting positions.",

        "summary_text": "Microsoft delivered blockbuster, better-than-expected financial results on Wednesday, but a leaked internal memo from the company\u2019s finance chief signals that employees should not exactly rest easy.\n\nIn an internal memo obtained by Business Insider, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said that the company\u2019s next fiscal year will \u201crequire intensity, clarity and bold execution.\u201d\n\n\"We're entering FY26 with clear priorities in security, quality and AI transformation, building on our momentum and grounded in our mission and growth-mindset culture,\" Hood told employees, according to BI. \"Both the pace of change and customer expectations are continuously accelerating.\u201d\n\nHer message comes as the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant on Wednesday reported fourth quarter net income of $27 billion and achieved a market cap value surpassing $4 trillion, joining only Nvidia as the only other publicly traded company to hit that mark.\n\nStill, Microsoft execs maintain that the company\u2019s remarkable financial performance will come with some growing pains. Earlier this month, the company said it plans to reduce about 4% of its workforce, or about 9,000 people, the Seattle Times reported. That came after several other rounds of cuts in 2025.\n\nIn a message to employees last week, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella described the moves as part of the \u201cenigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd yet, at the same time, we\u2019ve undergone layoffs.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the layoffs certainly may raise eyebrows. It also carries reputational risks of its own. Rita McGrath, executive director of executive education at Columbia University, said that such moves are a \u201csymbolic disconnect of a massive degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat definitely could damage the culture,\u201d she said in an interview with CFO.com.\n\nThe wider tech industry\u2019s reported layoffs likely stem from a \u201creal arms race in the AI world,\u201d McGrath said. Tech businesses are also under pressure to show that their enormous investments in artificial intelligence tools are justified. Microsoft, for its part, plans to spend over $30 billion on total capex this quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s incumbent on CFOs, McGrath said, to explain to analysts and the wider business community the clear reasoning behind any strategic shifts. As an example, she pointed back to Adobe\u2019s switch from selling software on physical CDs to selling it through cloud subscriptions. Though the company\u2019s revenue dipped at the time, its market valuation grew, McGrath said. She attributed that to efforts the company\u2019s CFO made to explain the shift.\n\nFor now, though, analysts are still apparently betting high on Microsoft\u2019s \u201cAI transformation,\u201d as CFO Hood put it in her memo. In a research note, Raymond James analysts said that Microsoft had an \u201cunusually strong quarter with hardly anything to complain about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Azure stole the show, the strong performance was pervasive throughout the company\u2019s print,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSegment results, expense trends, and guidance were all excellent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, despite job cuts, Microsoft\u2019s total workforce has been ticking up within the last few fiscal years. According to annual securities filings, Microsoft employed 228,000 people worldwide as of June 30. The tech giant reported the exact same number in the prior year. As of June 2022, Microsoft said it employed 221,000 employees, up from 181,000 employees in the prior year.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAmerican businesses are losing millions in productivity each year, often with most CFOs not realizing it.\n\nThe analysis is from workforce productivity software provider ActivTrak\u2019s Workforce Utilization Benchmarks Report 2H 2025, which analyzed 5,619 organizations and 304,083 workers and found that companies operate at just 87% of expected productivity.\n\nAcross industries, this translates to the equivalent of 130 employees per 1,000 workers producing no output \u2014 or $11.2 million in wasted salary annually per 1,000 employees. For CFOs facing tight margins, talent shortages and pressure to optimize every dollar, the findings highlight how much value can be unlocked by keeping teams motivated and productive.\n\nThe hidden productivity gap and the state of work\n\nActivTrak CFO Jana Wilson told CFO.com the findings underscore a growing challenge not only for businesses operating in all types of work structures, but also for finance leaders trying to do more with smaller teams.\n\nJana Wilson Permission granted by Jana Wilson\n\n\u201cMany finance teams are operating leaner than ever because of talent shortages, and automation can only fill so much of the gap,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWorkforce utilization data shows leaders where they\u2019re getting the most out of their people and where capacity is being left on the table. That insight allows finance leaders to redeploy resources with precision instead of over-hiring or over-relying on technology without clear ROI.\u201d\n\nThe report found that nearly six in 10 (58%) employees fail to meet daily productivity goals. For Wilson, that was the most alarming finding.\n\n\u201cCFOs tend to assume their teams are operating at full capacity because financial results often mask underlying inefficiencies,\u201d she said. \u201cOur analysis shows there\u2019s significant untapped potential, particularly in back-office roles where contributions are harder to measure but critical to operations.\u201d\n\nEven small inefficiencies multiply at scale, according to the report: Organizations with 251 to 1,000 employees lose $1.3 million to $1.7 million annually, and enterprises with more than 1,000 employees see losses of $3.7 million to $3.9 million per year.\n\nIndustry comparisons reveal where the losses are concentrated. Computer hardware teams have nearly 71% of employees below productivity goals, the highest rate in the report. Aerospace organizations face the greatest untapped capacity at 19%, with average productivity losses of $1 million annually per company. On the other end, logistics organizations have the lowest rate of underperformance at 41% and the least untapped capacity at 9%.\n\n\u201cWorkforce utilization data provides a place to start and helps leaders see how time is being spent and whether activity is aligned with company priorities,\u201d Wilson said. Data also indicates that for finance leaders balancing lean teams and automation, the ability to pinpoint underutilization is key to avoiding common challenges in contemporary finance like poor hires or investments in technology that do not deliver ROI.\n\nHow CFOs can measure and respond\n\nWilson said CFOs should start with a simple approach to productivity measurement. \u201cFocus first on the work that directly ties to business outcomes \u2014 how much time is spent there versus low-value tasks? That alone can highlight where capacity might be misaligned,\u201d she said.\n\nShe cautioned that capturing accurate workforce data is difficult for CFOs if they don\u2019t have proper systems designed for it. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to collect this data or calculate productivity metrics consistently without a system built for it,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cWorkforce analytics tools make it easier to capture the right data objectively, but the real value comes from how you use it,\u201d she added. \u201cTreat productivity metrics like financial metrics: Track them consistently, benchmark them and use them to drive action, not just as a reporting exercise.\u201d\n\nWilson added that workforce insights can also support morale and engagement. \u201cHelp people see how their work contributes to the bigger picture, especially in back-office roles that don\u2019t always have a direct line to revenue,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBe transparent about the why behind decisions and use data to show teams how they\u2019re performing against benchmarks,\u201d she said. \u201cThat clarity builds trust and engagement. Finally, create space for feedback and recognition \u2014 when people feel heard and valued, they\u2019re more resilient during change.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nGiulio Rindi, CFO for commercial and new payment flows at Mastercard, has spent more than a decade leading the company\u2019s global growth across Europe, international markets and now its expansion into new payment technologies.\n\nAs CFOs know, as the payments landscape shifts, finance teams are expected to move faster, manage greater complexity and guide their companies through an unpredictable global economy. Rindi\u2019s role encompasses this, as he oversees the financial strategy behind Mastercard\u2019s efforts to modernize consumer and B2B payment flows, strengthen resilience and unlock new opportunities for the business.\n\nIn this conversation with CFO.com, he reflects on the evolution of the CFO role, lessons from leading finance across multiple continents, how emerging payment trends are reshaping the finance function and managing the personal trade-offs that come with having a career path that has spanned the globe.\n\nGiulio Rindi\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Giulio Rindi\n\nCFO, commercial and new payment flows, Mastercard\n\nFirst CFO position: 2015\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nAmerican Express\n\nPirelli\n\nBDO\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nADAM ZAKI: Mastercard processes a huge amount of data. As a CFO, how do you ensure it\u2019s optimized and focus on what matters versus the noise?\n\nGIULIO RINDI: As far as financials and financial KPIs are concerned, we are very well organized and rely on very solid data sources, with consistency across the organization. When you are a global company, consistency is crucial.\n\nThe real opportunity for many organizations now is to combine financial KPIs with operational KPIs. The reality is you have your financials in your ERP, sales-related data in your CRM and operational datasets in different systems. Bringing it all together is complicated. To have it available in real time and in a user-friendly dashboard is even more challenging.\n\nThat\u2019s the next big opportunity for many organizations: Efficiently integrating financial and operational KPIs and connecting the dots across the business at 360 degrees. It\u2019s almost like a superpower to drive outcomes and efficient execution.\n\nWe, like other big corporations, have very good control of the finances. But when you add operational KPIs to the financials, you gain true actionable insights: Why do we see certain trends? Which operational aspects of the business do we need to optimize? What should we invest in? How do we go to the market faster?\n\nFor example, time-to-revenue is something we focus on a lot. You sign a deal with a customer after six, 12 or 18 months of negotiations, but then you might not see volumes or revenue materializing as per the business plan or contract terms.\n\nIn a global organization with thousands of sales and business development people signing deals, I want to know if those deals are being executed. The connection between financial and operational KPIs gives you real-time visibility and the ability to drive execution excellence.\n\nPayment modernization is a huge topic right now. Why do B2B payments still lag behind consumer payments in terms of speed and simplicity, and how can technology help close that gap?\n\nIn the consumer world, payments are now part of our daily lives. We have frictionless experiences, security and user-friendly digital interfaces. And then there is also an element of frequency \u2014 you\u2019re making certain payments often, and that smooths your experience and allows the industry to evolve faster.\n\nIn B2B payments, it\u2019s more complicated. There is more friction, and therefore the modernization you are talking about is needed and points to the significant opportunity in front of us.\n\nWe continue to invest in products and solutions that will make B2B payments and money movement domestically and internationally more efficient and frictionless.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one example: We have a proprietary virtual card solution that businesses can embed in their ERP systems. That is basically a way of managing payments directly through your ERP system. We are collaborating with key players in this space, as well as local ERPs, to make sure our solution is compatible and interoperable.\n\nTechnology like this can help CFOs and treasurers manage accounts payable more efficiently. If you embed a virtual card solution in your ERP, you can manage payments in an automated way, you can drive working capital optimization, you can have more control and you can optimize your credit lines and expense base.\n\nThese are the challenges we see corporations facing today globally, and our solutions are focused on making payments smarter and businesses stronger. I believe this is going to be the future.\n\nHow do you view emerging technologies like stablecoins, embedded finance and blockchain? Are they creating real efficiencies in finance today, or are they more about long-term strategic investment?\n\nI cannot really connect stablecoin to immediate efficiency within the finance function. What I can say is, of course, we are looking at stablecoins as a business. We\u2019re also looking at crypto and blockchain. We work with our tech partners to decide where to invest.\n\nIt goes back to capital allocation and investment prioritization. There are trends CFOs can\u2019t afford to miss. Finance needs to be on board. Stablecoins are one of those. We need to be there, we need to allocate capital and that\u2019s what we are doing. Then we will see how that technology will shape payments going forward.\n\nIt\u2019s about investment prioritization, capital allocation and staying in the race. We can do that as a company, which is both great and exciting.\n\nWhat is collaboration like with the other divisional CFOs at Mastercard? Do you reach out to them for insight, or is it more ad hoc?\n\nFirst and foremost, collaboration is all about personal relationships. For me, it\u2019s about creating genuine connections with other CFOs, whether it's other business unit CFOs, divisional CFOs or regional CFOs, but also with corporate functions such as FP&A, investor relations, real estate, sourcing, tax and controllership.\n\nBuilding those relationships over time is fundamental. You can have all the tools and knowledge you want, but without those relationships, you move slowly and inefficiently.\n\nSo in this case, it\u2019s not really about technology or processes. It\u2019s about the ability to connect at a personal level, to pick up the phone, to help your teams connect the dots. From there, you can develop tools or do ad hoc analysis, whether it\u2019s short-term or medium-to-long-term sustainable solutions.\n\nSometimes in organizations, things are done without that clarity. Maybe there\u2019s a business unit agenda or a personal agenda and you can\u2019t put it in context. For me, it\u2019s simple: Shareholder and stakeholder interests come first. That works across geographies and cultures.\n\nYou\u2019ve held leadership roles across the world, managing people from many different cultures and backgrounds. How has this experience helped you professionally?\n\nEvery time you change a company or a country, you need to adapt. There is an element of flexibility and adaptability.\n\nFirst, I think it\u2019s a privilege to be able to have all these opportunities. You need to be willing to embrace those because there is a price to pay from a personal standpoint. But it\u2019s very enriching \u2014 rewarding personally for your family, but also professionally.\n\nIt also comes with the responsibility of leading larger teams across different geographies with different cultural backgrounds. But I have found it extremely intellectually stimulating. It\u2019s helped me grow significantly because you face different mindsets, cultures and approaches.\n\nIt\u2019s all about super clear and crisp communication, a pragmatic approach, transparency and having the team\u2019s roles and responsibilities well defined. These are the key ingredients to support the delivery of the financial objectives and the execution of the strategy, and ultimately drive long-term sustainable shareholder value.\n\nYou mentioned earlier the personal trade-offs of having a global role. How have you balanced building your global career with being a good partner, parent and friend?\n\nI like to think of this like a stool with three legs. The legs are family, friends and professional career. Without one of those legs, you are unstable.\n\n\"I grew up in Rome, Italy, and didn\u2019t move for the first eighteen years of my life. Friends were everything for me, so I understand the value of stability and strong friendships. For my children, it\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s also enriching. They have a very unique perspective on the world now.\" Giulio Rindi CFO, Commerical and New Payment Flows, Mastercard\n\nLeaders often talk a lot about professional opportunity and growth. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the easy part. But family and social life are critical. Business leaders who embrace these types of professional journeys need to have a partner who supports them, the adventures that come with it, and must be willing to make some sacrifices themselves. It\u2019s not easy to change jobs and countries every three or four years.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed children are amazing at adapting. It\u2019s easier when they are younger, like 12 and under. It becomes more complicated and challenging for them after that. But again, it\u2019s a trade-off between giving them a broad perspective on the world versus more stability, which is also valuable.\n\nI grew up in Rome, Italy, and didn\u2019t move for the first 18 years of my life. Friends were everything for me, so I understand the value of stability and strong friendships. For my children, it\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s also enriching. They have a very unique perspective on the world now.\n\nFriendships are another fundamental aspect. I try to invest quality time in keeping in touch with old friends and building many new friendships throughout the journey, everywhere we live. It\u2019s a different dynamic, but it\u2019s incredible.\n\nWe live in a global world. We\u2019re all connected. It\u2019s easier now than when I left home. Back then, I didn\u2019t have an iPhone, a BlackBerry or even an email. Now it\u2019s easier to travel, easier to connect. So overall, it\u2019s a balancing act \u2014 a dance. You need all three legs of the stool to be very solid.",

UnitedHealth Group named Wayne DeVeydt as CFO, effective September 2, with outgoing CFO John Rex transitioning to a strategic adviser role. Carlyle announced Justin Plouffe will become CFO on January 1, 2026, while current CFO John Redett will lead global private equity. Other companies, including Amtrak, Briggs & Stratton, and Tines, also announced new CFO appointments. Everton Football Club's CFO will leave next month.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese leadership changes signal significant transitions for major public companies. UnitedHealth Group's outgoing CFO stated the appointment comes at a \"pivotal moment,\" highlighting its strategic importance. Diageo's interim CFO appointment follows the recent step down of its CEO and the prior CFO's move to interim CEO, indicating ongoing high-level leadership reconfigurations. Carlyle's planned 2026 CFO transition, with the current CFO taking a new leadership role, suggests a long-term strategic evolution of its executive structure. These shifts, as described, could challenge a current view of stable leadership or immediate financial direction in these companies.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSeveral notable companies are undergoing transitions in their chief financial officer roles. Diageo is bringing back a former finance chief amidst broader top-level executive changes. UnitedHealth Group is installing new financial leadership at a moment deemed \"pivotal\" by its departing CFO. Carlyle is setting up a future financial leadership change linked to a strategic reassignment for its current CFO. These appointments collectively highlight a period of significant executive movement across various sectors.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Deirdre Mahlan returns to Diageo as interim CFO on August 18.\n*   Wayne DeVeydt begins as UnitedHealth Group CFO on September 2.\n*   Justin Plouffe becomes Carlyle CFO on January 1, 2026.\n*   Costin Corneanu became Amtrak CFO on August 4.\n*   Adam Aringer became Briggs & Stratton CFO on August 4.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Diageo:** Alcoholic beverage maker appointing an interim chief financial officer.\n*   **Deirdre Mahlan:** Former finance chief returning to Diageo as interim CFO.\n*   **UnitedHealth Group:** Appointing a new CFO at a stated \"pivotal moment.\"\n*   **Wayne DeVeydt:** Appointed chief financial officer of UnitedHealth Group.\n*   **Carlyle:** Global investment firm announcing a future chief financial officer.\n*   **Justin Plouffe:** Will become Carlyle's chief financial officer in January 2026.\n*   **Nik Jhangiani:** Diageo's former interim CFO who became interim CEO.\n*   **John Rex:** Outgoing UnitedHealth Group CFO transitioning to a strategic adviser.\n*   **John Redett:** Current Carlyle CFO moving to lead global private equity business.\n*   **Amtrak:** National passenger railroad promoting its deputy chief financial officer.\n*   **Everton Football Club:** Premier League team whose chief financial officer will depart next month.\n*   **Briggs & Stratton:** Outdoor power equipment maker appointing a new chief financial officer.\n*   **Tines:** Workflow platform appointing a chief operating and financial officer.\n*   **Tecogen:** Clean energy products manufacturer promoting its chief accounting officer.\n*   **American Staffing Association:** Trade group naming a new chief financial officer.\n*   **Louisiana Tech University Foundation:** Promoting its comptroller to chief financial officer.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Deirdre Mahlan starts as Diageo's interim CFO on August 18.\n*   Wayne DeVeydt starts as UnitedHealth Group's CFO on September 2.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nLeadership shifts signal evolving strategies for major companies.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNvidia\u2019s unprecedented climb past a $4 trillion market cap this summer has not only set global valuation records, but has also made its CFO, Colette Kress, a billionaire.\n\nOn July 29, Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index listed Kress with a net worth exceeding $1 billion thanks largely to her equity holdings in the chipmaker. According to Bloomberg data, Kress owns or has options for more than 5.4 million Nvidia shares, worth roughly $1 billion at current prices.\n\nWhile valuations fluctuate with Nvidia\u2019s share price, the milestone places her in rare company. Fellow 10-figure net worth chief financial officers include former Oracle CFO and current CEO Safra Catz and Ineos CFO John Reece, who are among the few finance chiefs to have reached billionaire status.\n\nKress, who joined Nvidia in 2013 after senior finance roles at Cisco and Microsoft, has been a key figure in the company\u2019s AI-driven expansion beyond gaming processors into powering generative AI. During her 12-year tenure, Nvidia has become the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization and one of the most influential players in global technology markets and smart chip manufacturing.\n\nKress\u2019s wealth reflects how equity compensation has become the central driver of CFO net worth at hyper-growth tech companies. Unlike cash bonuses or short-term incentives, her stock grants vested for more than a decade.\n\nFor Nvidia, this compensation model extends well beyond the C-suite. The company\u2019s stock performance has created thousands of employees who are multi-millionaires, mirroring what happened with the equity awards for employees at Microsoft, Google and Apple during their early growth waves. While this makes for a motivated workforce, it can also complicate recruiting and retention once money is no longer a differentiator, a challenge companies like Meta have recently seen in their AI recruitment tactics.\n\nNvidia\u2019s compensation model highlights a potential long-term issue for finance chiefs at high-growth technology companies: As equity values grow, how do you keep incentivizing employees who already have achieved substantial personal wealth?\n\nCFOs at publicly traded companies are currently the youngest they have been in six years and have the highest turnover rate in the same timeframe. As equity-based compensation at fast-growing technology companies now results in higher-paid leaders, retaining executives who do not see a billion-dollar future at the company may also be difficult if opportunities elsewhere, particularly in technology, grow.\n\nKress\u2019s inclusion in Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index also underscores the central role CFOs now play in shaping company performance and the broader employee experience and corporate culture. For Nvidia, the rise of its now billionaire CFO is a direct reflection of the company\u2019s AI-driven market dominance and a reminder of the complex human capital challenges that accompany such rapid growth.",

In a June survey of 63 CFOs at firms with more than $500 million in revenue, 74% of respondents reported \u201cincreased influence on enterprise-wide decisions.\u201d What\u2019s more, nearly all (93%) said they had \u201csignificant influence\u201d on business strategy, and nearly three quarters (73%) reported the same influence on tech investments.\n\nWhat sorts of investments are finance chiefs making these days? Per the RGP report, more than half of respondents (57%) say they\u2019re allocating capital in tech and \u201cdigital transformation\u201d initiatives, including artificial intelligence capabilities. The same share of respondents said they\u2019re allocating capital for \u201coperational efficiency initiatives\u201d intended to \u201cstreamline processes and protect margins in an uncertain economic climate.\u201d\n\nThe more tech-focused CFO of today is necessarily forming tighter relationships with CIOs and other technology leaders at their organizations, according to RGP.\n\n\u201cThe CFO\u2019s perspective is becoming more essential to the success of digital investment, AI strategy and overall enterprise transformation, and so we\u2019re seeing CFOs and CIOs work more closely together on technology investments and implementations,\u201d RGP CFO Jenn Ryu said in an email to CFO.com. \u201cIn fact, nine in 10 of the CFOs we surveyed said their partnership with their organization\u2019s CIO has become more strategic in the last two years.\"\n\nBy the numbers 74% of CFO respondents who reported \u201cincreased influence on enterprise-wide decisions\u201d 93% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d on business strategy 73% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d over technology investments 63% said they have \u201csignificant influence\u201d over go-to-market strategies\n\nPer the report, 84% of respondents said they\u2019re optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence, though actual investments in such tools remain relatively low. Less than half of respondents said they\u2019re committing more than 10% of their capital budgets to AI, RGP researchers found.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm around AI is certainly continuing to increase, but many businesses are still in the early stages of AI adoption,\u201d Ryu said. \u201cThe key barrier that organizations face is data readiness. Only 27% of CFOs report complete trust in the quality of their data, and only 19% report complete trust in the reliability of their data.\u201d\n\nIn the bigger picture, all these changes point to the fact that \u201ctoday\u2019s finance leader is stepping beyond spreadsheets to shape the future of the enterprise,\u201d RGP officials wrote in the report. \u201cWhat was once a role defined by accuracy and compliance is now centered on agility, influence and transformation.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not to say such changes have always gone smoothly. \u201cNot every finance leader is ready for this evolution,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe path forward demands fluency beyond finance \u2014 deep curiosity about people, processes and platforms. It requires emotional intelligence to lead through change and the humility to listen as much as lead.\u201d\n\nManaging change during mergers and acquisitions was another area of concern. While about half of respondents (49%) expect to engage in M&A activity before the year is over, the same share also acknowledged that \u201cchange management remains a significant weakness.\u201d\n\nAmid quickly shifting U.S. trade policy, the future of M&A, of course, remains an open question. A pair of recent reports showed that, as of mid-year, activity had been on the rise year over year, but prospects are less clear for the rest of 2025.",

Over half (57%) are allocating capital to tech and digital transformation, including AI, and operational efficiency initiatives. Their partnerships with CIOs have also become more strategic, as reported by nine in ten CFOs. Despite 84% optimism for AI, less than half commit over 10% of capital budgets, with data readiness cited as a key barrier. Furthermore, while 49% expect M&A activity, the same share acknowledges change management as a significant weakness.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis data reveals CFOs are transitioning from traditional financial oversight to critical strategic and operational roles within organizations. Their increased influence on tech investments, particularly AI, signals their potential to either accelerate or impede digital transformation based on capital allocation and data confidence. The notable gap between high AI optimism and low investment, coupled with data trust issues (only 27% complete trust in data quality), challenges the notion of widespread, rapid AI deployment in the enterprise.

The settlement comes weeks after announcing it will permanently close following the 2025\u20132026 academic year.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April 2025 in federal court, alleged Andrews was terminated in retaliation for refusing to misrepresent budget details to the university\u2019s board and for encouraging a colleague to file a sexual harassment complaint against university president Douglas Palmer. The settlement terms have not been made public, and neither party has commented on the outcome.\n\nAndrews, who joined the university in February 2024, claimed she uncovered serious financial irregularities, including questionable budget proposals, misuse of fundraising dollars by athletic staff and instances of personal expenses being improperly classified as student-related. According to court documents, her opposition to Palmer\u2019s proposed budget and internal concerns about transparency preceded her being placed on unpaid leave that summer.\n\nThe complaint also accused the school\u2019s then-HR director Fran Johnson of spreading false allegations about Andrews that claimed she was having inappropriate relations with staff in campus facilities, which were later used as the basis for what Andrews described as a retaliatory internal investigation.\n\nSiena Heights declined to comment to MLive on the specifics of the case but previously stated all personnel decisions were made following a \u201cthorough and careful review\u201d and that it remained committed to a respectful and accountable workplace culture.\n\nThe legal battle has unfolded in parallel with the university\u2019s financial unraveling. In June, Siena Heights announced plans to shut down operations after the current academic year, citing enrollment declines, demographic shifts and rising costs. With roughly 1,700 undergraduates and fewer than 200 graduate students, the school will continue to operate through the 2025\u20132026 academic year while preparing for closure.\n\nFounded in 1919 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, Siena Heights has been deeply connected to the Catholic community in southeastern Michigan for over a hundred years. The Sisters, who remain its stewards, have evolved into major philanthropic and impact investment players, financing climate and social justice projects and leading shareholder advocacy campaigns supported by institutions like BlackRock.\n\nThis investing approach is not unique to the Sisters and is a part of a larger challenge the entire religious institution is currently grappling with. The college\u2019s closure also places Siena Heights among at least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges that have closed, merged or begun wind-downs since 2020.\n\nTo support students affected by the shutdown, Ashland University in Ohio has stepped in to offer credit transfer guarantees, financial aid counseling and academic advising as the schools work to formalize a partnership. The case highlights the increasing exposure CFOs face at struggling institutions, particularly in education, where financial transparency and governance breakdowns can become legal headaches.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Troubled university settles whistleblower suit amid financial collapse, planned closure.\n\n**Key details:**\nSiena Heights University quietly settled a whistleblower lawsuit with its former CFO, Debi Andrews, weeks after announcing its permanent closure. The April 2025 lawsuit alleged Andrews was terminated in retaliation for refusing to misrepresent budget details and encouraging a colleague's sexual harassment complaint. Andrews claimed she uncovered serious financial irregularities, including questionable budget proposals and misuse of fundraising dollars. The complaint also accused the HR director of spreading false allegations leading to a retaliatory investigation. Settlement terms have not been made public, and neither party has commented on the outcome.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis settlement coincides with Siena Heights' planned permanent closure, underscoring the severe financial challenges faced by smaller educational institutions. The lawsuit's allegations of financial irregularities and retaliatory termination highlight internal governance risks that can compound external pressures like declining enrollment. This case challenges any prevailing view that financial struggles in higher education are solely due to demographic shifts, revealing how internal breakdowns in transparency and oversight can directly contribute to an institution's demise and legal liabilities. It also underscores the growing legal risks for CFOs at financially struggling entities.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSiena Heights University, a century-old Catholic institution, announced its permanent closure after the 2025\u20132026 academic year. The university cited enrollment declines, demographic shifts, and rising costs as reasons for its shutdown. Founded in 1919 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, Siena Heights has a long history connected to the Catholic community. The Sisters, its stewards, are also major philanthropic and impact investment players. The college's closure reflects a larger challenge for religious institutions and places it among at least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges that have closed, merged, or begun wind-downs since 2020.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Lawsuit filed in April 2025.\n*   University founded in 1919.\n*   Roughly 1,700 undergraduates and fewer than 200 graduate students.\n*   Operating through the 2025\u20132026 academic year before permanent closure.\n*   At least 80 U.S. nonprofit colleges have closed, merged, or begun wind-downs since 2020.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Siena Heights University:** Century-old Catholic institution that settled a whistleblower lawsuit and announced permanent closure.\n*   **Debi Andrews:** Former CFO who filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging retaliatory termination over financial irregularities.\n*   **Douglas Palmer:** University president accused of proposing a questionable budget and being subject to a harassment complaint.\n*   **Fran Johnson:** Then-HR director accused of spreading false allegations against former CFO Debi Andrews.\n*   **Adrian Dominican Sisters:** Founders and stewards of Siena Heights, known for philanthropic and impact investment.\n*   **MLive:** Media outlet Siena Heights declined to comment to regarding the case specifics.\n*   **Ashland University:** Ohio university offering credit transfer guarantees and advising to Siena Heights students.\n*   **BlackRock:** Institution mentioned as supporting shareholder advocacy campaigns led by the Adrian Dominican Sisters.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Siena Heights University will continue operating through the 2025\u20132026 academic year before permanent closure.\n*   Siena Heights and Ashland University are working to formalize a partnership for student credit transfers.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWhistleblower settlement exposes deeper financial and governance issues at closing university.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFor CFOs who operate globally and are looking for ways to keep their people engaged, EY suggests that moving people across borders can be a viable option.\n\nThe 2025 EY Mobility Reimagined Survey, based on responses from more than 1,000 global mobility professionals and employees, explores how organizations are adapting their mobility functions to meet these challenges. The findings point to a growing divide between companies that treat mobility as a strategic asset and those that see it as an administrative task.\n\nThe most advanced organizations, referred to in the survey as having \u201cevolved\u201d mobility functions \u2014 a strong, multifaceted approach to relocating team members to new locations \u2014 are leveraging technology, outsourcing and cross-functional alignment to drive retention and efficiency. As CFOs face continued cost pressures and workforce constraints, mobility, though a bit costly on the front-end, is emerging as a critical lever for employee retention, development and growth.\n\nEffective vs. evolved mobility functions\n\nWorkforce mobility has traditionally been a back-office function focused on compliance and logistics. But that\u2019s changing fast, as EY researchers report that mobility is now being asked to solve some of the most pressing business challenges: filling senior roles, managing cross-border risk and retaining key talent. Yet only a small group of companies are getting it right, largely because their mobility functions are \u201ceffective\u201d but not \u201cevolved.\u201d\n\nNinety percent of employers agree mobility should align with broader talent and organizational goals, but less than a third (30%) have achieved that alignment. The result is a growing divide between companies with evolved mobility functions and those still operating in isolation.\n\nThese evolved programs are still fundamentally about relocating employees across borders, but unlike the processes of effective mobility functions, decisions are made in a way that encompasses strategy and data from across the business. They\u2019re more likely to personalize the relocation experience, track outcomes like ROI and retention and streamline complex tasks like immigration or tax compliance through outsourcing and automation.\n\nResearch indicates evolved programs are 3.7 times more likely to say mobility helps solve medium-term talent shortages and 1.8 times more likely to report that mobility supports business growth. More than half of employers say it now takes over a year to fill senior positions, underscoring the urgency for better talent deployment and employee retention strategies.\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s role in mobility\n\nEY research suggests generative AI is changing what workforce mobility can deliver. The number of mobility professionals using generative AI in their daily work rose from 22% to 35% in the past year, according to EY. Among companies with evolved mobility programs, adoption is even higher, with leaders using the technology to streamline immigration processes, flag compliance risks early and generate faster, more personalized employee support.\n\nThis transformation is changing how mobility functions operate and how they are valued by the business. Companies with more advanced programs are nearly three times more likely to increase investment in technology to help support employee mobility. By doing this and with the help of generative AI tools, these teams are more likely to track outcomes like post-assignment promotions, time to fill open roles and the revenue impact of relocation decisions.\n\nThey are also better at anticipating risk. EY found that evolved programs are 1.8 times more likely to have avoided business disruption, such as canceling or delaying a market expansion, because their mobility systems flagged immigration or regulatory issues before they became costly.\n\nFor CFOs, these capabilities offer more than efficiency. They turn mobility into a strategic function that supports growth, protects margins and helps make the most of every headcount investment.\n\nMobility may offer the growth Gen Z employees are looking for\n\nWhile the survey doesn\u2019t focus specifically on generational trends, the results strongly reflect what younger workers, particularly Gen Z, say they want from employers: personalized growth opportunities, meaningful experiences and flexibility in how and where they work.\n\nEY found that a large portion (85%) of employees describe mobility assignments as life-changing, and nearly half say they\u2019re more likely to stay with a company that offers them. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of employers include mobility in their total rewards framework, but evolved functions are 3.4 times more likely to be updating those rewards to reflect employee expectations. In a tight labor market, that kind of customization could make a measurable difference in retention and engagement.\n\nAt the same time, 96% of mobility professionals say they\u2019re focused on cost reduction. The most effective strategies include vendor consolidation, targeted outsourcing and better use of digital tools. Evolved programs are seeking twice as many cost-saving measures as basic ones, and are twice as likely to have fully automated or outsourced processes.\n\nThe takeaway EY is driving home to finance leaders is clear: Mobility can no longer be a circumstantial, siloed HR function. When aligned with strategy, powered by technology and tailored to today\u2019s workforce, it becomes a lever for retention, resilience and long-term value for the organization\u2019s future human capital.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe sole investor in the $2.5 billion American Heartland theme park and resort that failed to launch in Vinita, Oklahoma, has alleged fraud and psychological abuse from the developers, according to a lawsuit filed July 25 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n\nIn the suit, 91-year-old Gene Bicknell, who once owned a large chain of Pizza Hut franchises, alleges that promoters Richard M. Silanskas Jr., Larry K. Wilhite and Stephen D. Hedrick of Mansion Entertainment Group stole $60 million and caused him severe distress that led to a stroke last year.\n\nThe suit, which asks for the investment back along with other fees, includes texts and emails from Silanskas and Wilhite impersonating messages from God.\n\n\u201cSilanskas and Wilhite executed a predatory conspiracy of psychological manipulation \u2014 convincing Gene, through fraud and impersonation, that God himself was commanding him both to finance the park\u2019s construction and to grant Silanskas and Wilhite two-thirds ownership over the completed venture,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nDeveloper Mansion Entertainment Group announced in July 2023 designs for the 1,000-acre Americana-themed development, including roller coasters, an indoor water park, a 300-room hotel and an RV park. The footprint of the 125-acre theme portion would rival Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, in size.\n\nAt the time, Hedrick commented publicly that Bicknell was the sole financial backer, per the suit.\n\n\u201cThe plan was to use Gene\u2019s money to build the American Heartland Project and then steal it, paying themselves handsomely along the way,\u201d the suit reads. \u201cSilanskas already had a record of involvement in failed theme park projects that left empty-handed investors in their wake.\u201d\n\nThe RV area was originally scheduled to open in spring 2025, followed by the theme park and resort in fall 2026. Indeed, the RV area broke ground in 2023 but nothing more has been built besides a fence and a gravel road, according to the suit. Developers claimed that their design team includes former Disney Parks builders and Walt Disney Imagineers, but that was also a lie, the suit alleges.\n\n\u201cThe groundbreaking was essentially the beginning and the end of the construction work on the entire Project,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cInnocent people lost money by buying up land near Vinita with property values inflated by news of a theme park that would never exist.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the project has been sued. Canadian design firm Forrec and Columbus, Kansas-based Crossland Construction both filed claims in May 2024 alleging that they were not paid for their work. At least five lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed by vendors, according to Bicknell\u2019s suit.\n\nMansion Entertainment Group did not respond to Construction Dive's request for comment on the lawsuit.",

Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are expected to spend over $300 billion this year alone on data centers and compute power.\n\nTechnology adoption remains a critical barrier to the delivery of these projects, according to Revizto research, which found that many construction teams still rely on static, nonintegrated tools even for complex and fast-moving projects. The firm said 27% of global AEC professionals use email, spreadsheets and PDFs as their primary digital tools.\n\nHowever, data center construction demands complex coordination, massive datasets, strict regulatory compliance, high-stakes communication and tight timeframes, with some projects now moving from concept to full design in as little as 10 weeks, according to the white paper.\n\n\"The construction industry can't keep pace with demand using static tools like Excel and PDFs,\u201d said Revizto CEO Arman Gukasyan in a news release. \u201cIf we're serious about meeting the demands of modern data center builds, we need a fundamental shift in how we deliver the physical infrastructure that supports them.\"\n\nBeyond technology adoption, U.S. contractors are finding creative ways to meet the demand for data center development. For instance, contractors are consulting with clients on projects earlier than ever in the process to help evaluate site conditions, entitlement risks, energy procurement and utility interconnection timelines.\n\n\u201cPreconstruction services and capabilities have become a true differentiator,\u201d John Arcello, advanced technology core market co-leader at Redwood City, California-based general contractor DPR, told Construction Dive earlier this year. \u201cEarly engagement is critical to stay on track.\u201d\n\nContractors also are turning to prefabrication more aggressively. On remote sites, Arcello said teams are increasingly building components offsite in labor-rich regions and transporting them to projects. That helps ease skilled trade constraints and minimize rework, he said.\n\nIke Keene, vice president of commercial at Caddell Construction, a Montgomery, Alabama-based general contractor, said that the need for accurate cost forecasting has grown significantly. That\u2019s especially true as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add a fresh layer of volatility to material prices.\n\n\u201cThe newly adopted tariffs have become a new variable in cost control,\u201d said Keene earlier this year. \u201cWe are adapting day by day for accurate current and future pricing structures to aid our clients in forecasting for the future.\u201d",

Many teams still rely on static tools such as email, spreadsheets, and PDFs, even as projects move from concept to design in 10 weeks. This shortfall puts both infrastructure delivery and broader economic ambitions at risk.\n\n**Why it matters:** This issue matters because global capital expenditure on data centers is expected to surpass $1 trillion annually by 2029, with tech giants planning over $300 billion this year alone. The construction industry's inability to keep pace with demand using current methods risks slowing the delivery of critical infrastructure. This challenges the implied consensus that significant capital spending alone guarantees rapid data center expansion, suggesting physical infrastructure build-out is a growing bottleneck for tech giants and broader economic ambitions.\n\n**The big picture:** Global demand for artificial intelligence is intensifying, driving significant need for new data centers to support it. However, the construction industry faces a challenge in delivering these complex projects at the required scale and speed. Historically, the sector has relied on traditional, static tools, which are now insufficient for modern data center builds.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Data center capital expenditure expected to surpass $1 trillion annually by 2029.\n*   Tech giants expected to spend over $300 billion this year alone on data centers and compute power.\n*   27% of global AEC professionals use email, spreadsheets, and PDFs as primary digital tools.\n*   Some data center projects now move from concept to full design in as little as 10 weeks.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Revitzo:** Swiss construction software provider whose white paper highlighted industry delivery shortfalls.\n*   **Dell\u2019Oro Group:** Market research firm providing data center capital expenditure forecasts.\n*   **Microsoft:** Tech giant expected to spend over $300 billion this year on data centers.\n*   **Google:** Tech giant expected to spend over $300 billion this year on data centers.\n*   **Amazon:** Tech giant expected to spend over $300 billion this year on data centers.\n*   **Meta:** Tech giant expected to spend over $300 billion this year on data centers.\n*   **Arman Gukasyan:** Revizto CEO who emphasized the need for a fundamental shift in delivery methods.\n*   **DPR:** General contractor whose co-leader discussed preconstruction services for data centers.\n*   **John Arcello:** DPR advanced technology core market co-leader highlighting early engagement for projects.\n*   **Caddell Construction:** General contractor whose VP discussed increased need for accurate cost forecasting.\n*   **Ike Keene:** Caddell Construction VP discussing tariffs adding volatility to material prices.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President whose tariffs are mentioned as adding a layer of material price volatility.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Construction's tech lag jeopardizes AI-driven data center expansion and economic growth.",

Two dozen states specifically reported an $86.3 billion combined funding gap based on 2022 data. Despite previous federal aid from the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan Act, 33 states may still miss their infrastructure condition or funding goals. Even with inconsistent data, states like New York and Arkansas reported significant percentages of roads in poor or below-target condition. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas are among 29 states anticipating projected maintenance gaps.\n\n**Why it matters:** The anticipated funding shortfalls could significantly impact safety, economic development, and future state budget needs. Inconsistent data makes it difficult for policymakers to fully understand the scale of the challenge and connect funding gaps to unmet condition targets. This challenges a potential consensus view that recent federal initiatives, such as the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorizing $1.2 trillion, and increased state spending (up 21% in FY2024) are sufficient. Despite these funding increases and prioritization of transportation spending, many states still project significant maintenance gaps and may miss condition goals. The continued struggle implies current investment levels might not be adequate to prevent deterioration.\n\n**The big picture:** States historically apportioned an average of 6.8% of total expenditures to transportation in fiscal year 2022. Recent years have seen a significant influx of federal funds, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act further authorized $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure over five years, including approximately $350 billion for federal highway programs. With this federal assistance, states increased their average transportation spending to 8% in fiscal year 2024, representing over 21% growth in total state transportation spending.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRatan Lal is a preconstruction professional for Atlanta-based construction services firm H.J. Russell and Co. with about 10 years of experience in project management. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nIn the land of cranes, concrete and compounding delays, a quiet crisis looms over America\u2019s skylines: We don\u2019t have enough people to build them.\n\nDespite billions in infrastructure spending, a housing crisis demanding millions of new units and booming demand for data centers and clean energy facilities, the U.S. construction industry finds itself paralyzed by a labor shortage that isn\u2019t just cyclical \u2014 it\u2019s structural.\n\nBut where are the workers?\n\nIn the first place, construction depends on a pipeline that no longer exists.\n\nVocational education has been stripped from many public schools. Immigration, once the backbone of America\u2019s building trades, is mired in policy gridlock. Meanwhile, contractors haven\u2019t figured out how to recruit members of the younger generation, who are much different than previous generations when it comes to their attitudes, values and work styles.\n\nRatan Lal Permission granted by Ratan Lal\n\nToday, about 245,000 construction jobs remain unfilled, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nearly one in four workers is over the age of 55, and retirements are accelerating. The industry is bleeding institutional knowledge and struggling to attract replacements. And while robots and prefabrication can help, they are no match for the deep cultural and policy fractures that caused this shortage.\n\nWe must confront the elephant on the jobsite: Immigration reform is not just a border issue, it\u2019s a construction issue. About one-fourth of construction labor in the U.S. is foreign-born, and the share is even higher in trades like concrete, roofing and framing.\n\nSkilled immigrant workers sit in limbo due to outdated visa caps and restrictive pathways. If the U.S. is serious about building back better, it must first build smarter immigration systems: trade-specific visas, cross-border credentialing and partnerships with vocational schools abroad.\n\nDEI: An untapped reservoir\n\nLet\u2019s address another blind spot: diversity.\n\nOnly 11% of construction workers are women, according to the BLS. Black workers make up about 5%. LGBTQ+ representation and support remain almost invisible. Yet, we talk about labor shortages as if it\u2019s a supply problem, not a systemic exclusion problem.\n\nThe myth that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to work in construction\u201d ignores the lived reality of millions who were never welcomed in the first place.\n\nImagine instead an industry designed around working mothers, second-chance citizens, rural talent, neurodivergent problem-solvers and veterans.\n\nTo fix the labor shortage, the industry must first fix itself. That means real investment in community college trade programs, wraparound childcare, inclusive mentorship and pay equity. Not performative DEI, but foundational transformation.\n\nConstruction has long suffered from boom-bust cycles. When markets tighten, training is the first to go. Subcontractors churn. Apprenticeships are delayed. It\u2019s a recipe for fragility. The shift must be from cost-first to capacity-first planning.\n\nPublic owners, from city transit agencies to federal infrastructure programs, should mandate workforce development spending on every capital project. Private equity in real estate must tie return on investment to long-term labor investment.\n\nWe need to treat skilled labor not as a commodity, but a strategic asset.\n\nA blueprint for the future\n\nSolving the labor shortage in construction isn\u2019t about tweaking around the edges. It\u2019s about a new blueprint \u2014 one that recognizes:\n\nImmigration is workforce development.\n\nDEI is not a side initiative, it is labor market expansion.\n\nLabor policy must be proactive, not project based.\n\nCulture change is not optional, it\u2019s existential.\n\nIt\u2019s time to modernize the image of construction\n\nIf we do this right, construction could become the beating heart of inclusive American growth. Not just building buildings but building futures. Because the question isn\u2019t just \u201cWhere are the workers?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cWhat are we doing to bring them back?\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Senate late Saturday confirmed Sean Cairncross, a veteran Republican political operative with close ties to the Trump administration, to become the country\u2019s third national cyber director, setting up a test of how tightly the president\u2019s advisers will try to control cybersecurity policy from the White House.\n\nCairncross, a former chief operating officer and legal adviser at the Republican National Committee, served as the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation during Trump\u2019s first term. He does not have significant technology or cybersecurity expertise, although he told senators during his confirmation hearing that he had helped public and private organizations respond to cyberattacks. As head of the relatively new Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), he will have a significant opportunity to put his stamp on how the Trump administration approaches a wide range of cyber challenges.\n\nSenators voted 59-35 to confirm him.\n\n\u201cAs the cyber strategic environment continues to evolve, we must ensure our policy efforts and capabilities deliver results for our national security and the American people,\u201d Cairncross said in a statement shared by his new office. \u201cThe United States must dominate the cyber domain through strong collaboration across departments and agencies, as well as private industry. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will enter a new era of effective cybersecurity policy.\u201d\n\nCongress created ONCD in 2021 to serve as the president's chief adviser on cyber defense issues. During the Biden administration, the office led projects on growing the cyber workforce, improving open-source software security, protecting vulnerable critical infrastructure communities like K-12 schools, securing new energy technology, and streamlining cyber regulations. It also promoted closer government ties with security researchers, encouraged infrastructure projects to prioritize cybersecurity and championed work to secure space systems, internet routing technology and post-quantum cryptography.\n\nCairncross will have to decide which, if any, of those projects to continue and which new ones to launch. He has said little about where he will focus his office\u2019s attention, although he is likely to prioritize regulatory harmonization, given Republicans\u2019 complaints \u2014 echoed by the business community \u2014 that there are too many overlapping cyber rules. At his confirmation hearing, Cairncross promised to meet regularly with industry executives to understand how the government could help them.\n\nONCD\u2019s workforce grew steadily during the Biden administration as its leaders tried to make it an authoritative voice on cyber matters within the government. But tensions between the office and the National Security Council (NSC) limited ONCD\u2019s influence and even led to the resignation of the first national cyber director. Under Cairncross, the office could staff up again and push for greater authority.\n\nHacking back\n\nCairncross\u2019s most emphatic comments on cybersecurity have involved offensive cyber operations, a topic that is outside of ONCD\u2019s portfolio. At his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly argued that the U.S. could stem a growing tide of cyberattacks by hacking its adversaries to put them on notice. His focus on offensive activities represents a sharp departure from the vision of his Biden-era predecessors. But Cairncross\u2019s views are likely to win him allies on Trump\u2019s NSC cyber team, which is stocked with proponents of hacking back. Those relationships could help Cairncross avoid bureaucratic tensions and raise ONCD\u2019s profile within the administration and in the public eye.\n\nWarm reception\n\nLeading national security experts have praised Cairncross for his management experience, relationship-building acumen and ability to \u201crespond to rapidly evolving political dynamics shaping policy conversations at the highest levels of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSean\u2019s leadership, experience, and commitment to public service will be vital to [ONCD\u2019s] growth into the center of gravity for cyber strategy, planning, coordination, and response,\u201d Frank Cilluffo, director of Auburn University\u2019s McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, said in a statement after Cairncross\u2019s confirmation.\n\nJason Oxman, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a leading tech trade group, encouraged Cairncross to \u201cfocus on a strategic, coordinated approach to U.S. cyber policy\u201d and to push for the reauthorization of the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.",

Although he lacks significant technology or cybersecurity expertise, he will lead the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). Cairncross stated his aim to enter a \"new era of effective cybersecurity policy\" under President Trump, emphasizing strong collaboration across government and private industry.\n\n**Why it matters:** Cairncross's confirmation signals a potential shift in U.S. cybersecurity policy, departing from the previous administration's focus. His stated emphasis on offensive cyber operations, though outside ONCD\u2019s traditional portfolio, marks a sharp departure from Biden-era predecessors. This could challenge the prevailing consensus on U.S. cyber strategy by pushing for a more aggressive, \"hacking back\" approach. This change in leadership and potential strategic shift could impact cybersecurity regulations and industry engagement.\n\n**The big picture:** Congress created the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) in 2021 to serve as the president's chief adviser on cyber defense issues.

Hackers used 4L4MD4R ransomware to encrypt files, leaving a note demanding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The attackers disabled Windows Defender real-time monitoring and bypassed certificate validation. This marks a new dimension to the ongoing SharePoint attack campaign. Palo Alto Networks suggests this ransomware activity is unrelated to nation-state threats.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis ransomware attempt signals a worrisome escalation in the exploitation of SharePoint vulnerabilities, adding a direct financial extortion component. Crucially, Palo Alto Networks' finding that this attack appears unrelated to nation-state activity challenges prior warnings about China-backed hackers. This shift suggests a broader risk from opportunistic actors, expanding the threat landscape for organizations using widely adopted enterprise software like SharePoint. Investors should note the evolving nature of threats impacting prevalent technology.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe attack exploits recently disclosed ToolShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint, specifically CVE-2025-53770, which hackers have been exploiting for weeks. In July, at least 300 known compromises related to these vulnerabilities occurred worldwide, including U.S. government agencies. Shadowserver reported 17,000 exposed SharePoint instances online, with 840 still critically vulnerable. Many of these vulnerable servers contained webshells, indicating hacker presence.

But in April 2025, even before LockBit\u2019s final demise, RansomHub itself shut down. \u201cThe precise circumstances behind its disappearance remain unclear,\u201d Check Point researchers wrote, \u201cbut the impact on the ransomware ecosystem was immediate.\u201d\n\nRansomHub affiliates, which had been posting an average of 75 new victims every month in the six-month period leading up to the group\u2019s shutdown, needed a new partner. Many of them appear to have found that partner in Qilin, whose activity nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2025, from an average of 35 victims per month to almost 70, according to Check Point.\n\nQilin has demonstrated longevity, operating since 2022, and its activities after the demise of RansomHub help illustrate why: It knows when to capitalize on its competitors\u2019 misfortunes. After RansomHub went offline, Qilin began advertising its attack toolkit\u2019s \u201cenhanced features,\u201d Check Point said, including \u201cnew integrated DDoS capabilities and [victim] negotiation consultations.\u201d\n\nDragonForce, another major ransomware-as-a-service group, likewise tried to capitalize on RansomHub\u2019s demise, claiming that the group had migrated to DragonForce\u2019s platform. Check Point\u2019s data shows a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in DragonForce victim reporting in April and June, but the company said it was unclear if this represented a sustained trend or a momentary blip.\n\nDespite the changing threat-actor landscape, some aspects of the ransomware ecosystem remain the same, according to Check Point\u2019s report. The United States accounts for roughly half of all reported victims, with the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada each accounting for 5%. But some groups \u201cexhibit distinct geographic preferences,\u201d Check Point noted, including Safepay, which focused disproportionately on Germany, and Akira, which focused on Italy.",

Many smaller groups, previously affiliated with larger players, are now operating independently or seeking new partnerships. Established players like Qilin and DragonForce are actively competing to recruit these \"orphaned\" affiliates. This shift follows the shutdown of prominent groups such as RansomHub and the decline of LockBit.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis development underscores the \"whack-a-mole\" nature of the cybercrime ecosystem, where new ransomware groups rise quickly after predecessors collapse. It highlights intense competition among ransomware groups for affiliates and market share. The continuous adaptation and dispersal of these groups suggest that law enforcement actions, while impacting specific entities, do not eliminate the overall threat. This challenges any consensus view that the ransomware threat diminishes significantly with the takedown of individual major players.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe ransomware-as-a-service ecosystem is characterized by constant flux and adaptation to law enforcement pressures. Historically, prominent operators like LockBit faced decline and \"death blows,\" but others, such as RansomHub, expanded to fill the void. When these large groups falter, their affiliates become available for recruitment. This dynamic creates a competitive landscape where surviving groups vie for talent and market share from defunct operations.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   RansomHub affiliates posted an average of 75 new victims every month in the six months prior to the group's shutdown.\n*   Qilin's activity nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2025, from an average of 35 victims per month to almost 70.\n*   The United States accounts for roughly half of all reported ransomware victims.\n*   The United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada each account for 5% of reported victims.\n*   Qilin has demonstrated longevity, operating since 2022.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Check Point Software Technologies:** Published a new report indicating the ransomware ecosystem is more dispersed and competitive.\n*   **Qilin:** An established ransomware group that significantly increased its activity by recruiting affiliates from the defunct RansomHub.\n*   **DragonForce:** A major ransomware group that also tried to capitalize on RansomHub's demise by claiming affiliate migration.\n*   **RansomHub:** A ransomware-as-a-service operator that shut down in April 2025, leaving its affiliates without a partner.\n*   **LockBit:** A ransomware-as-a-service operator that had been declining for a year before a \"death blow\" in May 2025.\n*   **Safepay:** A ransomware group noted for disproportionately focusing its attacks on Germany.\n*   **Akira:** A ransomware group noted for focusing its attacks on Italy.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRansomware adapts, shifts, and competes, making the threat persistent.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s marquee program for collaborating with the private sector to thwart hackers has been seriously hobbled by the abrupt end of a major contract.\n\nThe Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) lost a large number of support personnel on Monday after CISA\u2019s contract with the technology firm ICF expired on July 25, according to three people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. \u201cJCDC went from 100-plus ICF contractors to 10\u201d after the Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contract in time, one of the people said.\n\nAnother person confirmed the unit lost more than 100 contractors.\n\nThe JCDC partners with companies, other agencies and foreign governments to plan for future threats, analyze ongoing attack campaigns and publish defensive guidance. Since its creation in 2021, it has coordinated the government\u2019s real-time responses to major incidents, held tabletop exercises with emerging industries, led detailed risk assessments for critical infrastructure sectors and spearheaded advisories on a wide range of topics.\n\nThe JCDC\u2019s loss of its contractors could significantly impede its collaborative work, including undermining its ability to marshal a unified private-sector response to a major cyberattack and reducing its capacity to collect and distribute threat information.\n\nDespite its ambitious remit, the JCDC has only a small federal staff and relies heavily on contractors for its day-to-day work, including unglamorous but vital activities like writing memos and arranging meetings. In particular, contractors \u201chelp to facilitate the relationship between CISA and other federal agencies,\u201d said one person familiar with the matter. There are more than 100 agencies, this person noted, and JCDC\u2019s partnerships team only has a few federal employees to manage all of those relationships.\n\nThe disruption to the JCDC\u2019s activities comes as CISA tries to stay ahead of increasingly aggressive Chinese state-backed attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure organizations. The JCDC has been serving as the tip of the spear for CISA\u2019s efforts to understand the extent of Beijing\u2019s campaigns.\n\nFor now, CISA can use emergency funding to retain the JCDC\u2019s remaining 10 ICF contractors for two weeks, and it can keep renewing that two-week arrangement until the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. But after that, the remaining ICF workers will need to leave.\n\nCISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said in a statement that the agency is \u201claser-focused\u201d on returning to its core authorities and \u201celiminating waste and saving taxpayer dollars.\u201d McCarthy said CISA is reviewing its contracts \u201cto ensure that all resources committed align with our core statutory mission and the priorities of the administration.\u201d She added that CISA is \u201ctaking steps to avoid any operational impact\u201d to its mission, but the agency declined to identify those steps.\n\nJCDC contractor ICF did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMore CISA cyber programs at risk\n\nThe ICF partnership is one of many CISA contracts that either recently expired or could soon expire because of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem\u2019s mandate that her office directly approve virtually all contracts for her $65 billion department. CISA\u2019s contract with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to analyze cyber-threat monitoring sensor data lapsed on July 20, and another contract with the lab expired in March.\n\nOther CISA contracts that could expire soon include Peraton\u2019s Cyber Threat Detection Analysis work, Nightwing\u2019s Engagement Support Services work and an arrangement with Sandia National Laboratories to produce defensive tools and risk assessment resources, according to a person familiar with the matter. CISA and the three organizations declined to discuss the contracts or even confirm their expiration dates. The person familiar with the matter said the Nightwing and Peraton contracts would expire at the end of August if not renewed.\n\nMore contract lapses could leave CISA in serious jeopardy, according to a second person familiar with the matter. \u201cEventually, [the agency] won\u2019t have the people to actually do work,\u201d this person said. \u201c[They\u2019re] losing people and not replacing them or their expertise.\u201d\n\nCISA is waiting for Noem\u2019s office to approve a one-year extension to the ICF contract, said a third person familiar with the matter, \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard that over a thousand similar memos are also waiting approval.\u201d",

The program went from over 100 ICF contractors to just 10, as the Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contract. This loss could severely impede JCDC's collaborative work, including its ability to coordinate private-sector responses to cyberattacks. CISA can use emergency funding to retain the remaining 10 contractors only until the fiscal year ends on September 30.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe disruption to JCDC's operations weakens the U.S. government's ability to counter increasingly aggressive Chinese state-backed cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. This could challenge the current consensus view that government and private sector cyber defenses are robust and seamlessly coordinated. The significant reduction in CISA's capacity to marshal unified responses and distribute threat information suggests increased exposure for companies reliant on such coordination.\n\n**The big picture:**\nCreated in 2021, the JCDC partners with companies, other agencies, and foreign governments to plan for threats and coordinate real-time responses. The program has a small federal staff and relies heavily on contractors for vital daily work. This loss of personnel comes as CISA efforts, spearheaded by JCDC, aim to understand the extent of Beijing's cyber campaigns.

The group consists largely of English-speaking young men, including many teenagers, from the U.S. and the U.K. Authorities estimate that it may have as many as 1,000 members.\n\nThe group is affiliated with an underground collective known as The Com, which experts have linked to a variety of crimes ranging from extortion and money laundering to predatory behavior involving minors, cryptocurrency theft and SIM swapping.\n\nScattered Spider does not operate as a consolidated, centralized unit, according to Palo Alto Networks, but rather in multiple subsets, each of which may have its own set of targets and collection of preferred techniques.\n\nThe hacker gang debuted on the scene in September 2023 with a headline-grabbing ransomware attack against hotel and casino giant MGM Resorts. The hackers disrupted operations at the property for several days, locking guests out of their rooms, shutting down elevators and disabling slot machines and ATMs. The attack cost the company more than $100 million.\n\nResearchers also linked Scattered Spider to the 2023 hack of household-products giant Clorox, which forced the company to shut down many of its systems and led to months of product shortages. In a $380 million lawsuit filed earlier this month, Clorox alleged that its IT vendor, Cognizant, failed to uphold its duties by handing over credentials to the hackers without authenticating them.\n\nAlways on the run\n\nIn November 2024, the the U.S. Department of Justice charged five people with stealing millions of dollars by harvesting employee credentials through phishing texts. Security researchers have described that activity, which involved hacks of 45 companies from September 2021 through April 2023, as Scattered Spider\u2019s initial crime spree.\n\nSpanish authorities arrested one of the defendants, a 23-year-old British man named Tyler Buchanan, and extradited him to the U.S. in April. The indictment and extradition led some security experts to believe the authorities had successfully neutralized Scattered Spider.\n\nBut in April, the group launched a series of social-engineering attacks against three major British retail companies: Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op. Two other major British companies may also have been hacked but have yet to admit it, Marks & Spencer\u2019s chairman told British lawmakers earlier this month.\n\nScattered Spider\u2019s latest attack spree, which began in April, cost an estimated 440 million British pounds, according to the U.K.-based Cyber Monitoring Centre.\n\nEarlier this month, British authorities arrested four people in connection with Scattered Spider\u2019s attacks. Police also seized a large trove of computer equipment and are analyzing it for evidence that could lead to additional arrests.\n\nMeanwhile, in May, Scattered Spider turned its attention to the U.S., launching a round of attacks against major retailers and their vendors, including Victoria\u2019s Secret, North Carolina-based Belk and Whole Foods distributor United Natural Foods.\n\nUNFI warned earlier this month that its breach could cost it up to $400 million in lost sales.\n\nSince June, Scattered Spider has shifted to new industries, targeting major insurance companies, airlines and other transportation companies. Recent victims have included Aflac, Allianz Life and Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance. Scattered Spider may also have been behind recent hacks of Hawaiian Airlines and Qantas.",

The group, known for social engineering, has expanded its targets from hospitality, telecommunications, and retail to major British and U.S. retailers, and more recently, insurance, airlines, and transportation companies. This surge in activity and new targets follows earlier arrests and extraditions that had led some experts to believe the group was neutralized. The group operates in multiple subsets, making its activities harder to contain.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe article explicitly notes that some security experts believed authorities had successfully neutralized Scattered Spider following earlier indictments and extraditions. However, the group's continued and escalating attacks, including their expansion into new sectors like insurance and airlines, directly challenge this view. This ongoing threat, described by CISA as \"serious and ongoing\" with risks to \"national security and economic stability,\" suggests a higher and more persistent cybersecurity risk than previously perceived.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is suing Columbia University for trademark infringement, unfair competition and breach of contract, according to court documents filed last week.\n\nAttorneys for Columbia Sportswear say the university is in breach of a written agreement between the parties over the sale of apparel merchandise. The two groups entered a written agreement in 2023 that the university would not use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name alone.\n\nLast year, Columbia University\u2019s webstore offered for sale shirts, sweatshirts and hats that bare the word \u201cColumbia\u201d on its own, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say violate the contract and its trademark rights.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is seeking a jury trial in the complaint against Columbia University. It also asks that the university be prevented from using the trademark name alone on apparel and accessories, along with recalling any such products currently in the university\u2019s possession. The brand also is seeking monetary damages.\n\nIn 2023, the sportswear company said the two groups entered a written agreement whereby the university could use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name, for which the sportswear company has a trademark, if the name was used with one other distinguishing mark associated with the university, such as its shield, crown or lion mascot logo, or words, such as \u201cuniversity,\u201d \u201cColumbia Law,\u201d or its year of founding.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Columbia Sportswear is headquartered in Portland, Oregon.\n\nSome of the Columbia University apparel mentioned in the lawsuit include the Nike and Champion logos, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say can create customer confusion and a false association between Columbia Sportswear and its competitors.\n\nAn example of Columbia University\u2019s allegedly infringing products. Retrieved from Court Filing\n\n\u201cThough Columbia Sportswear and Nike are headquartered in the same State and are both highly reputable sporting apparel designers and have a generally friendly relationship, the two companies have never collaborated to jointly design, manufacture, market, or sell any product,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA consumer looking at the Infringing Merchandise would never know that, and, in fact, would reasonably be induced into believing the companies had.\u201d\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this case will be settled out of court, and fairly quickly, said Josh Gerben, trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Columbia Sportswear\u2019s version of the story in the complaint is not entirely accurate, and Columbia University decides to defend the case, things could get interesting,\u201d Gerben said in an email. \u201cThis is because Columbia University has been around much longer than Columbia Sportswear. It gives the university some very interesting defenses to the overall claims regarding trademark infringement.\u201d\n\nColumbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday. In Q1, the company reported a net sales increase of 1% to $778.5 million. At the time of the announcement, the company withdrew its full-year financial outlook due to economic uncertainty related to tariffs.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University over trademarked apparel.\n\n**Key details:** Columbia Sportswear is suing Columbia University for trademark infringement and breach of contract. Attorneys for Sportswear allege the university violated a 2023 written agreement by selling apparel with only the \"Columbia\" name. The prior agreement stipulated the university must use \"Columbia\" with a distinguishing mark or word. Sportswear claims this creates customer confusion and a false association with competitors like Nike and Champion. The company is seeking a jury trial, prevention of solitary \"Columbia\" name use, product recall, and monetary damages.\n\n**Why it matters:** This lawsuit highlights the importance of intellectual property and brand protection for companies like Columbia Sportswear. It matters because the alleged breach involves a specific written agreement from 2023, potentially making the legal path clearer for Sportswear. The inclusion of competitor logos on allegedly infringing university apparel could dilute Sportswear's brand identity and create market confusion. For investors, this legal action could impact Columbia Sportswear's brand value or divert operational resources. This challenges a potential consensus view that established entities with similar names can easily coexist under prior agreements, indicating unexpected legal disputes can arise impacting a company's brand clarity and market position.\n\n**The big picture:** Columbia Sportswear holds a trademark for the \"Columbia\" name used on apparel. The two parties, Columbia Sportswear and Columbia University, had a written agreement in 2023 allowing the university to use the name only with other distinguishing marks or words. Last year, the university\u2019s webstore allegedly offered products that violated this specific condition by using \"Columbia\" alone.

Maura Healey has announced plans to propose legislation that would devote $400 million to support research across the state amid federal funding uncertainty .\n\nThe money would be split evenly across two funds: a multiyear research funding pool to support projects at universities, hospitals and research institutions, and an additional funding reserve to support research and jobs at the state\u2019s public college s.\n\n\u201cIn the face of uncertainty from the federal government, this is about protecting one of the things that makes Massachusetts so special \u2014 our global leadership in health care and helping families across the world,\u201d Healey said in the Thursday announcement.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHealey\u2019s proposal comes as the Trump administration freezes and terminates research grants at universities in its crosshairs to pressure them into making policy changes, along with cutting funding more broadly across major scientific agencies.\n\nIn Massachusetts alone, the Trump administration has terminated research grants valued at nearly $583 million, according to a recent analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. When they were canceled, the grants had $252 million left to be paid out.\n\nOverall, the Trump administration has terminated research awards valued at roughly $6.9 billion across the U.S., the analysis found. Of that, $3.3 billion of the canceled funding hadn\u2019t yet been disbursed. The analysis did not account for frozen research grants, suggesting the level of hampered research funding across the nation may rise even higher.\n\nHealey\u2019s announcement pointed to the state\u2019s economic reliance on federal research funding. The state received nearly $8.6 billion in federal research funding in fiscal year 2024, which supported roughly 81,000 jobs and $7.8 billion in household income, recent findings from the University of Massachusetts Amherst found.\n\nMoreover, Massachusetts accounts for 1 in 10 research and development jobs in the U.S., according to the announcement.\n\nHalf of the $400 million would go toward a one-time funding pool to help pay for projects at universities, hospitals and research institutions. This pool would also support a one-year fellowship program for early-career researchers, the announcement said.\n\nThat pot of money would be housed at MassDevelopment, the state\u2019s development finance agency, and Massachusetts would use interest from its state stabilization fund to finance it.\n\nThe other half of the $400 million would be housed in a bridge funding reserve for the state\u2019s public colleges. That funding would support research costs, partnerships and jobs, including positions for graduate and postdoctorate students.\n\nThat fund would be paid for from revenue from Massachusetts\u2019 Fair Share, which adds a 4% tax on those with incomes above $1 million.\n\nSeveral university leaders in the state praised the proposal. They include the president of the University of Massachusetts, the state\u2019s public university system, as well as leaders of private institutions including Boston University, Northeastern University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cAdvances that spring from our universities, hospitals and laboratories benefit all Americans; if we see these institutions diminished or compromised, all Americans stand to lose,\u201d MIT President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth noted that \u201cno other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale.\u201d\n\nMIT has seen over $6 million worth of federal grants terminated, according to Center for American Progress data.\n\nMassachusetts is also home to Harvard University, which the Trump administration has cut off from all future federal research funding. Earlier this month, Harvard officials said the Trump administration\u2019s actions combined with recent congressional moves, such as raising the endowment tax wealthy institutions pay, could cost the university $1 billion a year.",

Maura Healey proposes legislation to devote $400 million to support state research. The funds would be split evenly into two pools, one for universities, hospitals, and research institutions, and another for public colleges. One fund aims to support projects and a one-year fellowship for early-career researchers, housed at MassDevelopment. The second fund, for public colleges, would support research costs, partnerships, and jobs for graduate and postdoctorate students. The first fund would use interest from the state stabilization fund, while the second would be financed by Massachusetts' Fair Share tax revenue.\n\n**Why it matters:** This proposal aims to protect Massachusetts' global leadership in healthcare and its significant economic reliance on federal research funding. The state received nearly $8.6 billion in federal research funding in FY24, supporting 81,000 jobs and $7.8 billion in household income. Massachusetts also accounts for 1 in 10 U.S. research and development jobs. This state-level investment challenges the current consensus that federal funding cuts will inevitably diminish major research institutions, indicating a proactive move to safeguard the state's research ecosystem and economy.\n\n**The big picture:** The Trump administration is freezing and terminating research grants to pressure universities, along with cutting funding across major scientific agencies. In Massachusetts alone, the Trump administration has terminated nearly $583 million in research grants, with $252 million left unpaid.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nInternational enrollment at U.S. colleges could drop by as much as 150,000 students this fall unless the federal government ramps up its issuing of visas this summer, according to recent projections from NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n\nThe financial consequences could be severe. A 30% to 40% decline in new foreign students would lead to a 15% overall drop in international enrollment and, with it, a potential loss of $7 billion in revenue for colleges and 60,000 higher education jobs, NAFSA estimated.\n\nThe organization attributed the projected decline to various Trump administration actions, including travel bans and an earlier suspension of visa interviews. NAFSA called on Congress to direct the State Department to expedite processing for student visas.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPreliminary data from early this year suggested \u201cflat to modest growth\u201d in international student enrollment, but NASFA pointed to policy changes that could alter the landscape ahead.\n\nSince President Donald Trump retook office this year, many in the higher education world have worried international enrollment would decline in response to his policies and the perceptions abroad about America and how welcoming it will be to foreign students.\n\nHis administration has indeed taken an aggressive stance on admitting students from outside the U.S. In June, Trump signed an executive order banning travel from 12 countries and imposing restrictions on seven others. And the president has recently considered bans on 36 more countries.\n\nAlso in June, the State Department announced expanded screening that included surveillance of social media posts for applicants of F, M and J nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThat followed an announcement in May from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the U.S. would move to \u201caggressively revoke\u201d visas for Chinese students. Trump later appeared to walk back that stance on social media, adding more confusion as to the administration\u2019s actual policy.\n\nNAFSA pointed to reports of limited to no visa review appointments for prospective international students in India, China, Nigeria and Japan. The organization noted that India and China send the most international students to the U.S., while Nigeria and Japan are the seventh and 13th leading home countries, respectively.\n\nOn top of those moves, the administration has demonstrated interest in using international student enrollment as leverage against institutions and activists in Trump\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThrough various directives, for example,Trump and his government have tried to bar Harvard from enrolling international students in the administration\u2019s ongoing feud with the university. Each of those efforts have been temporarily blocked in court. Had they not been, the consequences for Harvard would likely be dire. In the 2024-25 academic year, the Ivy League university\u2019s roughly 6,800 foreign students made up 27.2% of its student body.\n\nEarlier this year, the administration also moved to deny visas for pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nA July report from analysts with Moody\u2019s ratings services pointed to the potential financial fallout for colleges from declines in international enrollment. They noted that foreign students tend to pay full tuition and fees, heightening the potential revenue impact.\n\nA stress test by the analysts found that for 130 colleges they rate, a 20% drop in international enrollment would translate into a 0.5 percentage-point hit to their earnings margin before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization. For 18 colleges, EBITDA margin loss would be 2 to 8 points. Those with already low margins could face \u201csignificant financial stress,\u201d the analysts said.",

Although the university at the time hadn\u2019t received official notification of a targeted freeze from the government, it saw around 150 stop-work orders and grant terminations from federal agencies by May 1.\n\nLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported via an anonymous source that the Trump administration was in talks with Northwestern and other universities about possible deals that would involve a hefty fine to resolve the investigations. The news followed Columbia University's controversial settlement with the government requiring a $221 million payment in return for the government restoring most of its research funding.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Daily Northwestern on Tuesday, a group of Northwestern faculty described such fines as a \u201cransom\u201d and called on university leadership to \u201cresist the administration\u2019s attack on fundamental democratic principles by refusing to 'make a deal' with the administration.\u201d",

Senior leaders stated that this \"drastic step\" is necessary to bridge a budgetary gap that remains after prior non-personnel cost reductions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese deep staff cuts signal severe financial strain for a prominent university, indicating that previous austerity measures were insufficient. With employee costs making up 56% of Northwestern\u2019s total annual spending, personnel reductions were deemed unavoidable to address budget deficits.

        "summary_text": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Liz Clark would have lost a bet on the massive Republican tax and spending bill passed and signed into law earlier this month.\n\nClark, the vice president for policy and research at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said she didn\u2019t expect the bill to be finalized until early fall. While only off by a few months, Clark\u2019s missed guess illustrates just one of many unexpected developments for higher education \u2014 and the world \u2014 since President Donald Trump retook office in January.\n\nSpeaking at NACUBO\u2019s annual conference near Washington, D.C., on Sunday, Clark pointed to more than a decade of divided governments, intraparty policy squabbles and political gridlock as Democrats and Republicans have traded thin majorities in Congress.\n\nBased on that history, it might have seemed improbable that Republicans could swiftly move a massive policy package through two houses of Congress where they held razor-thin leads. But Republicans did, and Congress got a bill to Trump\u2019s desk by the date he demanded.\n\n\u201cThis is a quintessential moment in seeing that past performance is no indication of future results,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThe bill has plenty of implications for college finance departments, not to mention students and all other stakeholders in higher education. And it\u2019s just one of many policy sea changes the sector has seen since Trump and a Republican-led Congress came to office six short months ago.\n\nFrom new taxes to new legal liabilities, below is a look at how politics and policy are impacting college finance offices.\n\nA blitz of executive orders\n\nSo far in his roughly six months in office, Trump has already issued more executive orders than Joe Biden did during his entire four-year term. According to data from the American Presidency Project, Trump is on pace to issue more orders per year than any other president in history, except potentially Franklin Roosevelt in his first term at the height of the Great Depression.\n\nAnd several of those orders have cut to the heart of higher ed in the U.S., including orders targeting college diversity initiatives and seeking to revamp accreditation.\n\n\u201cEvery president has tested the limits of executive power. This is not new,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhat is new, at least for us, especially when it comes to issues impacting higher education, is the scope, the number of executive orders, the number of changes in law that are impacting your campuses.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have, this year, been dealing with everything, everywhere, all at once.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order on diversity, equity and inclusion programs has drawn rebukes, including through litigation, for being vague and potentially stifling to free speech and intellectual activity.\n\n\"DEI is not illegal,\" Clark said, pointing specifically to the administration's executive order on the topic.\n\nCollege researchers, meanwhile, are being asked to certify their compliance with executive orders, including those related to DEI, when applying for grants. That can present a dicey situation when directives are vaguely worded.\n\nIn some cases, federal agencies have even asked researchers to certify compliance with all future executive orders that may be issued someday, noted Jen Gartner, deputy general counsel for University of Maryland, College Park, at a NACUBO conference panel Monday.\n\n\u201cObviously, we don't know what we would be certifying compliance with,\u201d Gartner said.\n\nCertification requirements for grants can vary by agency, but Gartner noted the one commonality is that they \u201cnow all mention that our certification is material for the False Claims Act.\u201d\n\nThe False Claims Act bars fraud in government contracting. Trump\u2019s Department of Justice in May launched an initiative that threatens universities with investigations under the law over their DEI programs and policies for transgender students and athletes.\n\nSpeaking from firsthand experience, Gartner said such investigations can take years to settle and cost colleges time, money and reputational damage \u2014 all of which adds financial and legal stakes to what might seem like bureaucratic formalities in certifications.\n\nBig changes to higher ed under the big bill\n\nThe spending law enacted in July contains several policies set to shake up higher ed both directly and indirectly. \u201cI would go so far as to say that the issues we saw in this bill were akin to a Higher Education Act reauthorization,\u201d Clark said, referring to the primary federal law governing higher education and student aid \u2014 which was last reauthorized in 2008.\n\nNew policies include higher taxes on the wealthiest college endowments, with the top rate jumping to 8%, up from 1.4% currently.\n\nIt also opens up Pell Grants to short-term workforce-focused programs at accredited institutions that last eight to 15 weeks, while adding borrowing limits, and making other changes to student aid.\n\nBryan Dickson, NACUBO\u2019s director of student financial services and educational programs, described the short-term Pell Grants as a \u201cgreat win\u201d for community colleges at this week\u2019s conference. He added, however, that there are still questions about how the program will work, including about conflicting statute language on whether students already holding bachelor\u2019s degrees will be eligible for the short-term grants.\n\nThe bill additionally creates a new accountability system for college programs that's meant to ensure most students get an earnings boost from their credentials.\n\nCollege programs that fail the earnings test in two out of three consecutive years can lose their eligibility for the federal student loan program. Dickson emphasized that the policy applies only to direct loans, not other Title IV programs such as Pell Grants.\n\nAside from the specific higher ed policies, colleges could see indirect effects from the law.\n\nOne of the largest could be the massive cuts Republicans made to Medicaid and food stamp programs. Those cuts could put pressure on states to fill in the gaps to reduce the harms to their lower-income residents \u2014 which in turn could mean less money available for public institutions in state budgets.\n\n\u201cIf you thought your current battles with your state legislature were bad, just wait for what's to come in 2026,\u201d Clark said.\n\nDeep cuts to the Education Department\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has made deep staff cuts to the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 in line with a Trump executive order calling for the department\u2019s dismantling to the \u201cmaximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\u201d A full elimination of the department would require congressional approval.\n\nNow with a staff roughly half its former size, the Education Department still has plenty to do, including writing regulations for the new short-term Pell Grants and accountability programs created by the spending bill, among other administration priorities and statutory requirements.\n\nSome effects from the cuts are already evident. Dickson pointed to a National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators survey showing that 47% of institutions confirmed their region\u2019s federal Financial Student Aid office had closed. Another 42% said that their students were \u201cexperiencing issues with federal loan servicing, such as delays, misinformation, or unresolved inquiries.\u201d\n\nMore challenges could be ahead.\n\n\u201cWe haven't seen yet a major stress test on what the staffing level decreases mean,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWe're approaching the fall semester. We're approaching fall drawdowns. We will see what that means.\u201d\n\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s desire to wind down the Education Department, the agency \u2014 and all its regulations \u2014 still exist, for now.\n\n\u201cYou cannot go forward in your work thinking there's going to be no Department of Education and not submit your reports to IPEDS [the federal Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System] or close out certain cases or investigations that may be ongoing,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYour work continues. Your compliance requirement continues.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** New Republican Policies Rapidly Reshaping Higher Education Finance\n\n**Key details:**\nA new Republican tax and spending bill, finalized earlier this month, is significantly impacting higher education. It raises taxes on the wealthiest college endowments to 8% and expands Pell Grants to short-term workforce programs lasting eight to 15 weeks. The bill also introduces a new accountability system for college programs, which could lead to loss of federal student loan eligibility for failing an earnings test in two out of three consecutive years. Separately, President Trump's administration has issued a blitz of executive orders, exceeding Joe Biden's four-year total, impacting college diversity initiatives and accreditation. These orders create new legal liabilities, requiring colleges to certify compliance for grants.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThese swift policy changes challenge the previous consensus of political gridlock, with Liz Clark stating \"past performance is no indication of future results.\" The new tax on endowments and changes to Pell Grants and accountability directly alter college financial models. Furthermore, deep staff cuts at the U.S. Department of Education, now roughly half its former size, are already causing issues like federal loan servicing delays and regional office closures. This rapid, broad-scope policy action and its operational impacts defy the historical pattern of slow legislative progress in a divided government, creating immediate financial and compliance burdens for institutions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPresident Donald Trump took office six months ago with a Republican-led Congress, marking a significant shift from over a decade of divided governments and political gridlock. Historically, it was seen as improbable for a party with razor-thin majorities to swiftly pass massive policy packages through Congress. The new administration's actions, including a major tax and spending bill, represent significant policy changes for higher education. These changes are compared to a Higher Education Act reauthorization, which last occurred in 2008, indicating a major overhaul.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **8%:** New top tax rate for the wealthiest college endowments, up from 1.4% currently.\n*   **8 to 15 weeks:** Length of short-term workforce-focused programs now eligible for Pell Grants.\n*   **2 of 3 years:** College programs can lose federal loan eligibility if they fail an earnings test this many consecutive years.\n*   **Roughly half:** The current size of the U.S. Department of Education staff compared to its former size.\n*   **47%:** Institutions confirming their region\u2019s federal Financial Student Aid office had closed.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Liz Clark:** Vice president for policy and research at NACUBO, highlighting unexpected and rapid policy changes.\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Issued a high volume of executive orders and signed the new tax and spending bill.\n*   **Joe Biden:** Former president, used as a comparison for the number of executive orders issued.\n*   **Franklin Roosevelt:** Historical president, mentioned for the pace of executive orders in his first term.\n*   **Jen Gartner:** Deputy general counsel for University of Maryland, College Park, discussed grant certification and legal risks.\n*   **Bryan Dickson:** NACUBO director, described short-term Pell Grants and new accountability system impacts.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The upcoming fall semester and fall drawdowns will serve as a stress test for the reduced staffing levels at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRapid policy shifts challenge higher education finance and operations, demanding new compliance.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice alleged Tuesday that the University of California, Los Angeles violated civil rights law by failing to do enough to protect Jewish and Israeli students from harassment.\n\nThe findings stem from UCLA\u2019s approach to a pro-Palestinian encampment that students erected on the university\u2019s campus in the spring 2024 term. UCLA officials declined to disband the encampment for nearly a week, citing the need to balance free speech protections with student and employee safety.\n\nIn a letter to Michael Drake, president of the University of California system, Justice Department officials said they would seek to enter a voluntary resolution with UCLA to \u201censure that the hostile environment is eliminated.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Justice Department is also investigating the entire University of California system over similar allegations. That systemwide probe found \u201cconcerning evidence of systemic anti-Semitism at UCLA that demands severe accountability,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a Tuesday statement.\n\n\u201cDOJ will force UCLA to pay a heavy price for putting Jewish Americans at risk and continue our ongoing investigations into other campuses in the UC system,\u201d Bondi said.\n\nJustice Department officials gave UCLA leaders until Aug. 5 to reach out about entering a voluntary resolution. They threatened the university with a lawsuit by Sept. 2 if they don\u2019t believe they can strike an agreement with the institution.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation focused on the pro-Palestinian encampment erected on UCLA\u2019s campus on April 25, 2024. Encampment demonstrators demanded that the university divest from companies with ties to Israel\u2019s military.\n\nOn the same day it was erected, a university spokesperson told the campus community that officials were monitoring the situation to balance the \u201cright to free expression while minimizing disruption\u201d to the institution\u2019s teaching and learning mission.\n\nHowever, several days into the protest, some demonstrators formed human blockades to prevent some people on campus from moving freely throughout Royce Quad, including students wearing a Star of David or those who refused to denounce Zionism, according to an internal report from a university task force released last October.\n\nThe task force also found the encampment violated university rules and that the blockades disparately impacted Jewish people.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s letter to UCLA heavily cited the university\u2019s own task force report, as well as 11 complaints the university received alleging that encampment protesters discriminated against them based on their race, religion or national origin.\n\n\u201cUCLA\u2019s documentation established that it did not outright ignore these complaints; however, the University took no meaningful action to eliminate the hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students caused by the encampment until it was disbanded,\u201d the letter states.\n\nViolence broke out at the site on the night of April 30, 2024, when counterprotesters attempted to dismantle the encampment\u2019s barricade, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe counterprotesters attacked those within the encampment, including by launching fireworks into the encampment and hitting the pro-Palestinian protesters with sticks, according to the publication. Some of the pro-Palestinian protesters also fought back.\n\nPolice arrived hours later, though they did not immediately break up the violence. The next day, UCLA officials made the call to have police break up the encampment, resulting in over 200 arrests.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the encampment on Royce Quad was both unlawful and a breach of policy,\u201d then-UC Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement. \u201cIt led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission. It needed to come to an end.\u201d\n\nIn their letter, Justice Department officials criticized university leaders, alleging they knew that protesters were \u201cengaging in non-expressive conduct unprotected by the First Amendment\u201d and were denying \u201cJewish and Israeli students access to campus resources\u201d days before they moved to disband the encampment.\n\nUCLA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department findings come the same day the university settled a lawsuit from Jewish students and a Jewish professor, who alleged their civil rights were violated because UCLA allowed protesters to block their campus access.\n\nThe agency\u2019s letter mentioned the lawsuit\u2019s filings, though it did not refer to the settlement.\n\nAs part of that agreement, UCLA agreed to pay about $6 million, with the funds going directly toward the plaintiffs and their legal fees, as well as to Jewish groups and a campus initiative to combat antisemitism.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice released guidance Wednesday that threatens to strip grant funding from colleges and other federally funded institutions over what the agency deems unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nThe agency\u2019s memo targets a sweeping set of practices, including offering race-based scholarship programs, allowing transgender women to access bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity and having identity-based lounges or study spaces on campus \u2014 even if they are open to all.\n\nBut the nine-page memo goes a step further, saying even neutral criteria \u2014 such as recruitment strategies targeting certain regions \u2014 could be deemed unlawful if the Justice Department determines they are chosen because of their demographic composition.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s memo comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked similar guidance from the U.S. Department of Education that broadly targeted diversity, equity and inclusion programs at federally funded colleges and K-12 schools. The order came in response to a lawsuit that alleged the guidance \u201cradically upends\u201d federal antidiscrimination laws.\n\nThe guidance from the Justice Department illustrates the major shift in how the agency under President Donald Trump approaches enforcement of civil rights laws, with officials now targeting programs that were often actually launched to fight systemic discrimination.\n\nEarlier this month, the National Urban League declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for antidiscrimination policies, calling the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement priorities \u201can existential threat\u201d to civil rights laws, according to The Associated Press.\n\nLike the Education Department\u2019s blocked guidance, the Justice Department\u2019s new memo warns that government officials could pull federal funding from institutions that don\u2019t comply. That threat comes at the same time the agency has ramped up investigations into colleges over their diversity initiatives and their responses to antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe DOJ memo contains examples of practices it lists as \u201cunlawful\u201d and says could lead to federal funding being revoked, as well as a list of recommendations, which it says are not mandatory, to avoid \"legal pitfalls.\"\n\n\u201cThis Department of Justice will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in illegal discrimination,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cThis guidance will ensure we are serving the American people and not ideological agendas.\u201d\n\nAs examples of unlawful practices, the agency highlighted race-based scholarships or programs, including mentorship programs or leadership initiatives reserved for members of certain racial groups.\n\nThe memo could upend admissions. It recommends colleges end programs \"designed to achieve discriminatory outcomes\" even if they have \u201cfacially neutral\u201d criteria, such as targeting scholarships to certain regions to increase enrollment or participation among certain racial groups.\n\n\u201cInstead, use universally applicable criteria, such as academic merit or financial hardship, applied without regard to protected characteristics or demographic goals,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo also takes aim at what it describes as \u201cunlawful proxies\u201d for race and sex. As an example, the memo calls out universities that ask job applicants \u201cto demonstrate \u2018cultural competence,\u2019 \u2018lived experience,\u2019 or \u2018cross-cultural skills\u2019 in ways that effectively evaluate candidates\u2019 racial or ethnic backgrounds rather than objective qualifications.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department also flagged diversity statements \u2014 which typically ask job or graduate student candidates to explain their experience and commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives \u2014 as potentially unlawful if they advantage \u201cthose who discuss experiences intrinsically tied to protected characteristics.\u201d The memo said the same of asking for statements from applicants about \u201cobstacles they have overcome,\u201d a common essay prompt for college applications.\n\nState lawmakers have likewise targeted diversity statements, with many outlawing public colleges from requiring them in job or admission applications.\n\nThe memo also said failing to \u201cmaintain sex-separated athletic competitions and intimate spaces\u201d could violate federal law. The Justice Department\u2019s examples of those violations include allowing transgender women to use bathrooms, showers, locker rooms and dormitories designated for women, as well as allowing them to compete in women\u2019s athletic events.\n\nAnd it mentions college lounges or other spaces designated for specific groups, such as a \u201cBIPOC-only study lounge.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment,\u201d the memo stated. \u201cThis extends to any resource allocation \u2014 such as study spaces, computer labs, or event venues \u2014 that segregates access based on protected characteristics, even if intended to create \u2018safe spaces.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt also takes aim at diversity training, giving the example of requiring teachers at K-12 schools to complete a DEI training that includes statements such as \u201call white people are inherently privileged\" or touching on \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d\n\nThe memo says such trainings could violate civil rights laws \u201cif they create a hostile environment or impose penalties for dissent in ways that result in discriminatory treatment.\u201d",

It comes one month after The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, alleged that Duke Law Journal potentially gave students applying to be editors an edge if they held leadership positions in affinity groups or if they explained how their \u201cmembership in an underrepresented group\u201d would help them promote diverse voices.\n\nDuke Law Journal shared this information only with the law school\u2019s affinity groups, according to the Beacon.\n\nThe letter from HHS and the Education Department doesn\u2019t provide the source of the allegations of racial discrimination against Duke\u2019s medical school and Duke Health. However, it says Duke Health would be \u201cunfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government\u201d if the federal government determines they are true.\n\nIn their letter, officials suggested they want to cut a deal with the university.\n\n\u201cOur Departments have historically recognized Duke\u2019s commitment to medical excellence and would prefer to partner with Duke to uncover and repair these problems, rather than terminate this relationship,\u201d McMahon and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote.\n\nThe two Cabinet secretaries demanded that the university review and reform policies at Duke Health to ensure they don\u2019t include illegal racial preferences, including by making \u201cnecessary organizational, leadership, and personnel changes.\u201d\n\nThey also asked Duke to establish a Merit and Civil Rights Committee, which would be delegated authority from the university\u2019s board, to conduct the review.\n\n\u201cThe Committee must be made up of those members of Duke\u2019s leadership and medical faculty most distinguished in and devoted to genuine excellence in the field of medicine, and the members chosen must satisfy the federal government as to their competence and good faith,\u201d McMahon and Kennedy said in their letter.\n\nMcMahon and Kennedy threatened Duke with enforcement actions if the federal government and the Merit and Civil Rights Committee reach an impasse \u2014 or if they don\u2019t change the \u201calleged offending policies\u201d within six months.\n\nFollowing Columbia\u2019s controversial agreement with the federal government \u2014 which also included vast policy changes \u2014 law and free speech scholars warned that the Trump administration may attempt to increase their pressure campaigns against other universities to cut deals.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has made clear that while Columbia is first in line, it intends to reach comparable agreements with other schools \u2014 to scale the Columbia shakedown into a broader model of managing universities deemed too woke,\u201d David Pozen, a Columbia law professor, wrote in a blog post. \u201cAs has already occurred with law firms, tariffs, and trade policy, regulation by deal is coming to higher education.",

        "summary": "**Federal agencies launch civil rights probes into Duke University's practices.**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. Department of Education has opened a civil rights investigation into Duke University and its law journal, based on allegations of racial discrimination in selecting publication editors. Separately, the Education Department and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are reviewing allegations that Duke\u2019s medical school and Duke Health racially discriminate in their hiring, admissions, financial aid, and recruitment practices. The law journal probe stems from reporting that it potentially gave an edge to students in affinity groups or those from underrepresented groups applying to be editors. The letter from HHS and Education Dept. states Duke Health would be \u201cunfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government\u201d if allegations are true.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe investigations pose a significant financial threat to Duke University, specifically mentioning the potential termination of Duke Health's financial relationship with the federal government. Federal officials are demanding Duke review and reform policies at Duke Health, including making \"necessary organizational, leadership, and personnel changes.\" This direct federal intervention and demand for internal restructuring challenges the typical consensus of autonomy for major universities. The situation is presented as a template for broader federal pressure campaigns against other universities.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThese probes follow U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon's statement that Columbia University\u2019s $221 million settlement with the federal government would serve as a \"template for other universities.\" The Education Department's investigations aim to determine if Duke violated Title VI, which prohibits federally funded institutions from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. The allegations against Duke Law Journal were initially reported by The Washington Free Beacon. Law and free speech scholars have warned that the Trump administration may increase pressure campaigns against universities to cut similar deals.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   $221 million: Columbia University's settlement with the federal government.\n*   6 months: Deadline for Duke to change \"alleged offending policies\" before enforcement actions.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Department of Education:** Opened civil rights investigation into Duke University and its law journal.\n*   **Duke University:** Subject of federal civil rights investigations regarding alleged racial discrimination.\n*   **Duke Law Journal:** Under investigation for allegedly racially discriminating in its editor selection process.\n*   **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:** Sent a letter with Education Dept. reviewing Duke Health allegations.\n*   **U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon:** Announced the probes, seeing Columbia's settlement as a template.\n*   **Columbia University:** Reached a $221 million settlement, serving as a template for other universities.\n*   **U.S. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.:** Co-signed letter with McMahon regarding Duke Health allegations.\n*   **The Washington Free Beacon:** Conservative publication that reported allegations against Duke Law Journal.\n*   **David Pozen:** Columbia law professor who warned of broader federal pressure campaigns on universities.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Duke is expected to establish a Merit and Civil Rights Committee to review and reform policies.\n*   Duke must change \"alleged offending policies\" at Duke Health within six months to avoid enforcement actions.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFederal government pressures Duke on discrimination, threatening funding and demanding reforms.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn early June, the governing board of Florida\u2019s university system surprised the higher education sector when it rejected Santa Ono as the sole finalist for the presidency of the University of Florida. Ono had faced backlash \u2014 led by conservative activist Christopher Rufo \u2014 over his past embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while head of the University of Michigan.\n\nLater that month, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan abruptly stepped down after the U.S. Department of Justice pressured him to resign over the institution\u2019s diversity efforts. Ryan said he wouldn't fight to keep his job when staying would have cost the institution research funding and student aid and hurt international students.\n\nThe duties of the modern college president extend far beyond keeping their institutions viable. For decades, how the head of a college is selected and who fills the position has been steadily shifting. Now, whoever assumes the role will likely take vitriol from both the public and policymakers.\n\nJames Finkelstein, professor emeritus at George Mason University's public policy school, researches leadership in higher education. We spoke with him about the changing role of the college president, the increased influence a presidency faces from both the political and private sectors and what that means for higher ed in the long run.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHIGHER ED DIVE: How does one become a college president? And has that changed in recent decades?\n\nJames Finkelstein, professor emeritus at George Mason University Permission granted by Judith Wilde\n\nJAMES FINKELSTEIN: The traditional route would start with becoming an assistant professor. You get tenure next, and then you may start to move up the administrative ranks. The most common path was to go from provost to president. For now, that's still the most common path, but it's on the decline.\n\nThe problem is, provosts don't fundraise. Deans do. And the No. 1 qualification that a board now looks for in a university president is their ability to raise money.\n\nGiven that shift in priorities, how do college boards pick their institution's next presidents?\n\nMy colleague, Judith Wilde, and I have studied this process extensively, and boards are increasingly relying on executive search firms.\n\nWe found that only 2% or 3% of presidential classified ads mentioned a search firm in 1975. Today, it's almost 100%. And based on the data, that change has also correlated with the beginning of the decline in the length of university presidents' tenure.\n\nSearch firms do the initial screening and determine for the board which candidates are really viable. But very few of the search firm senior executives have any real experience in higher education and their No. 1 responsibility as fiduciaries is to return profit to investors.\n\nFrom there, the board picks from the candidates highlighted by the search firm? What do they look for?\n\nYes. People tend to look for candidates who look like them. And boards are not primarily made up of academics \u2014 the only thing most board members know about a university is that they got a degree from one. You're seeing a lot more political types on the boards, as is the case in Virginia, or corporate types.\n\nIt's interesting, corporations don't turn to universities for their leadership. They don't select a college president to run them. The former president of TIAA [Clifton Wharton Jr.] was the only university president to become a CEO of a Fortune 500 company \u2014 and he led a company designed to serve universities.\n\nBut many universities, at least 10% or so, will select a corporate executive to lead them.\n\nIf boards expect university presidents to behave more like corporate executives than leaders of an educational, social and cultural institution \u2014 someone who serves the public \u2014 then the next generation of university leadership is going to look very different. You're going to see a different kind of person be not only sought after but interested in these jobs because they think they can take their private sector skill set directly into higher ed.\n\nIn recent years, the presidential compensation packages at some colleges have mirrored those of Fortune 500 CEOs. In 2022, Ben Sasse received a notably lucrative package when he was hired to lead the University of Florida, as you and Judith have discussed . What effect does that shift have on colleges?\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate, the university president probably wore a tweed sport coat with leather patches on the elbows. And the patches weren't there to make a style statement; it's because the elbows were worn out. If he had a car \u2014 and it was far and away \"he\" when I was in school \u2014 it was a car from the university's car pool that was several years old.\n\nAnd in the past, presidents maintained some academic interests. They taught. They were visible on campus.\n\nNow, university presidents drive expensive cars and are more likely to associate with people outside the university than faculty inside the university.\n\nOur sector does not enjoy the reputation with the public that it used to. There are all sorts of questions now about the value of a college degree. People generally think faculty get paid a lot of money and don't do very much.\n\nMore than anything, presidents today are facing the question of if there is a way to win back that trust.\n\nWhile college presidents are grappling with that question, though, they are also watching their positions become increasingly precarious. One recent example is Santa Ono, who had been set up as Sasse's replacement. Traditionally, the vote from the Florida universities' governing board would have been pro forma. What shifted the tides and left Ono out of a job?\n\nOno was targeted by the Chris Rufo machine. You can go back and read Rufo's interview with Politico and listen to his interview with The New York Times \u2014 he's very public about his strategy to delegitimize leaders in higher ed. His team made a decision early on that they wanted one of their own in Florida. And Ono wasn't it.\n\nHaving watched the entire governing board meeting in Florida, my professional assessment is that I've never seen a president or someone of Ono's stature so ill-prepared and give so poor a performance on every level.\n\nWhoever prepared him, didn't. And if they did, they weren't preparing him for the right thing. It was much like what happened to the college presidents who testified at congressional committee hearings. Ono wasn't completely prepared that he was going to be essentially cross-examined by a former state legislator.\n\nBy that point, Ono had already announced his departure from the University of Michigan, leaving a highly debated track record on diversity efforts and the handling of student protests in his wake. Does he stand a chance of getting another job heading a university?\n\nAbout 75% of presidents are what we call one-and-done \u2014 they report they'll hold one presidency, and that's more than enough. The Gordon Gees of the world are the exception, not the rule.\n\nOno was, in my view, the modern-day equivalent of [former West Virginia University President] Gordon Gee. He's the professional president who developed a public persona. He developed it at the University of Cincinnati, refined it at the University of British Columbia, and then brought it to Michigan.\n\nBut I've talked to people at Cincinnati and Michigan. The truth of the matter is, he wasn't well-thought of by the faculty. And he burned out very quickly in Michigan.\n\nOno shouldn't be the model for the modern university president. Personally, I don't think that he's going to get another presidency after the Florida situation, at least not for a while.\n\nIs the role of president still a consequential one? Do the heads of colleges wield influence in the same way they have in the past?\n\nWho the president is makes a difference. They set the tone of the institution in many ways. But presidents today can exercise less independent leadership than they did in the past \u2014 they're being put on a shorter and shorter leash.\n\nThere are so many different constituencies that they're having to serve, and a lot of those constituencies are in conflict with each other.\n\nSome presidents are engaging in what people call anticipatory compliance.\n\n\"In order to avoid these conflicts,\" the thinking goes, \"I'm going to get one step ahead.\" Sadly, what that means is that when the board intervenes, they want even more.\n\nIs there a world where that kind of interference becomes so unpleasant that it renders the job unpalatable?\n\nI think for many serious potential candidates, the answer is yes. It doesn't matter whether you're being paid $1 million. Or if you have two country club memberships, a big car, a big house and staff, and all of that. These jobs have always been 24/7, 365. And the scrutiny is exponentially worse now.\n\nThe real question is: Who's going to want these jobs? That's part of the plan of critics of higher education. They want to drive people out so they can replicate what they're doing in Florida and appoint political loyalists who have no experience in higher education.\n\nEven though conservatives are critical of what they see as judicial activism, they have been extraordinarily active on college boards, working to influence curriculum and promotions and tenure.\n\nThe current climate changes things for all trustees, even those who don't align with this thinking. Regardless of their backgrounds, no board will want to appoint a president who is going to put at risk all of their research funding. And the Trump administration has shown that it is willing to use any lever it has to bring these institutions under its thumb. Look how quickly Jim Ryan was gone from UVA.\n\nAs you mentioned, presidents are serving increasingly shorter tenures, instead of holding the position for life, or at least until retirement. Beyond a loss of leadership consistency, does this turnover hurt colleges?\n\nTake Jim Ryan as an example. He's 58 years old.\n\nI assume the terms of his contract were renegotiated when he left, but based on my analysis of his 2022 contract, the university has a future liability of almost $17 million to him. He would actuarially retire from teaching in 15 years, and in 2038, his base salary would be over $1 million a year for teaching at most two courses a semester.\n\nThe people who are actually doing most of the teaching at UVA in 2038 won\u2019t be tenured or tenure track. They will be contingent faculty who are barely able to scrape together a living.\n\nIf you put $10 million in a scholarship fund at UVA, would that be a better investment than keeping Ryan on the faculty? The answer is a no-brainer.",

Boards prioritize fundraising ability and increasingly rely on executive search firms, which now handle almost 100% of searches, up from 2-3% in 1975. This shift correlates with a decline in presidential tenure length and a rise in compensation packages mirroring Fortune 500 CEOs. Many universities, at least 10%, now select corporate executives to lead them.\n\n**Why it matters:** The increasing politicization and corporatization of college presidencies create significant financial and operational instability for universities. Shorter tenures, costly executive search firm reliance, and large compensation packages drain institutional resources, exemplified by Jim Ryan's $17 million future liability. This challenges the consensus view of universities as stable, academically-driven institutions, suggesting they may increasingly function under short-term, externally imposed agendas that prioritize political alignment or fundraising over academic continuity and public trust.

The global leasing decline was attributed to tariff-driven uncertainties, especially in the industrial sector.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nColliers' significant engineering segment growth suggests strong performance in a key area, bolstered by a confident revenue pipeline. However, the modest global leasing decline, particularly in industrial due to tariffs, highlights a challenge for the real estate services division. This performance, especially regarding industrial leasing, might challenge any consensus view expecting smoother or stronger industrial activity, signaling potential macroeconomic headwinds impacting specific real estate sectors. The company is anticipating an uptick in leasing activity later in the year to meet full-year targets.\n\n**The big picture:**\nColliers operates as a diversified real estate services and engineering company with three distinct segments. Its engineering division is experiencing robust growth fueled by increasing demand in infrastructure development and energy projects. The company is actively pursuing strategic growth through acquisitions, including a 60% stake in European credit platform Roundshield Partners to expand in student housing and hospitality. Additionally, Colliers has rebranded its investment management division as Harrison Street Asset Management and completed six tuck-in acquisitions across its engineering and real estate services segments.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **18%**: Colliers' total year-over-year revenue growth.\n*   **$1.35 billion**: Colliers' total revenue for Q2 2025.\n*   **67%**: Engineering segment's year-over-year revenue increase.\n*   **$436 million**: Engineering segment's revenue in Q2 2025.\n*   **12 months**: Value of the engineering work backlog in terms of revenue.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Colliers**: Real estate services and engineering company reporting strong Q2 2025 earnings driven by segment momentum.\n*   **Christian Mayer**: Colliers' Chief Financial Officer, expressing confidence in the engineering pipeline and discussing leasing challenges.\n*   **Roundshield Partners**: European credit platform, 60% stake acquired by Colliers to boost specific capabilities.\n*   **Harrison Street Asset Management**: New brand name for Colliers' rebranded investment management division.\n*   **Terra Consulting Group**: Telecommunications infrastructure consulting firm in Chicago, acquired by Colliers' engineering segment.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Colliers expects a healthy uptick in leasing activity in Q3 and Q4.\n*   This anticipated uptick is crucial to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year in real estate services.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nColliers' engineering strength propels growth, balancing real estate leasing headwinds.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nNorth American data centers and networks helped drive growth \u201caligned with expectations\u201d in the first half of 2025, Schneider Electric said Thursday in an earnings update .\n\nThe energy management giant expects growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as it adjusts to U.S. tariffs. It sees double-digit annual growth for its data centers and networks segment and mid- to high- single-digit growth for its infrastructure and industry segments through 2027.\n\nTwo recent moves will bolster Schneider\u2019s competitive advantage in the data center business, executives told investors and analysts on an early-Thursday call: its acquisition of a majority stake in cooling solutions provider Motivair earlier this year and a partnership with NVIDIA to develop optimized data center reference designs.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSchneider\u2019s revenues grew 8% and net income increased 6% in H1 2025, the company reported. North America was its strongest geography, with 13.8% organic revenue growth propelled by a 15.9% jump in revenue from its energy management group, which includes its data centers and networks business.\n\nContinued strong performance in Schneider\u2019s data center and networks vertical appeared to validate executives\u2019 comments earlier this year that the emergence of more efficient AI models like DeepSeek would not meaningfully impact technology companies\u2019 investment plans.\n\nCEO Olivier Blum said the Motivair acquisition would help Schneider maintain its \u201cleading position\u201d in the space with a full data center efficiency solution \u201cfrom grid to chip and chip to chiller.\u201d In its partnership with NVIDIA, the company expects to work on \u201cwhat will be their next chips [and] what are the designs we need to provide [to] make sure data centers are more efficient\u201d using those new chips, Blum said.\n\nSchneider announced a separate collaboration with ETAP earlier this year to produce digital twins that simulate data center operations, helping developers and future occupants optimize efficiency and performance before facilities are built.\n\nIn its buildings vertical, Schneider\u2019s EcoStruxure for Buildings platform and majority ownership of building management software provider Planon helped it slash key customers\u2019 building energy consumption to around 30% of the global average for comparable facilities, the company said. In case studies it shared, an upgrade to an uninterrupted power unit at a cancer hospital in India helped it improve energy efficiency by 30% and an occupancy-based room conditioning system at a London corporate headquarters helped it achieve 22% savings in operational energy use and carbon intensity.\n\nThe EcoStruxure solutions span a range of onsite power management, efficiency and decarbonization solutions for commercial and industrial facilities, the company says.\n\nLast year, for example, Schneider unveiled a battery energy storage system to support self-contained microgrids that can reduce heavy power users\u2019 peak energy demand \u2014 a costly operational expense. Data center developers and operators are likewise turning to flexible onsite power solutions that \u201cisland\u201d from the main grid to bypass grid connection queues that can stretch for years.\n\nBusiness environment\n\nSchneider said unfavorable foreign exchange dynamics reduced Schneider\u2019s global group revenues by 2.1%, mainly due to weakening of the U.S. dollar, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and Mexican peso relative to the euro, the home currency of the France-based company. Schneider has substantial manufacturing operations in the United States, India, Turkiye and Mexico.\n\nEconomists blame the decline in the U.S. dollar this year on a \u201crisk premium\u201d caused by mounting federal debt and the Trump administration\u2019s unpredictable trade policy.\n\nU.S. tariffs and inflation for raw materials were further headwinds for Schneider in the first half, offsetting productivity gains in a trend that Chief Financial Officer Hilary Maxson said could continue through the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cDepending on [the] timing of various tariff actions in the U.S., we\u2019d now expect our gross margin progression for the full year could be somewhat negative,\u201d Maxson said Thursday.\n\nBut Schneider\u2019s \"demonstrated pricing power\u201d ought to help the company \u201cfully offset the impacts of tariffs and inflation over the next quarters,\u201d she said.\n\nSchneider mounted a quick response to tariffs during the first months of the Trump administration, but the benefits may not be apparent until the company reports its second-half performance early next year, Blum said.\n\nSchneider\u2019s actions so far include \u201cmost of the price increase\u201d that customers will see as a result of the tariffs imposed so far, though \u201cif there are further actions to be implemented depending on the latest news, of course we will continue to do more,\u201d he said.",

The energy management giant expects growth to accelerate in H2 2025, forecasting double-digit annual growth for its data centers segment through 2027. This outlook follows the acquisition of cooling solutions provider Motivair and a partnership with NVIDIA to develop optimized data center designs. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced global revenues by 2.1%, and U.S. tariffs are expected to impact full-year gross margin.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nSchneider's strong data center performance validates executive comments that efficient AI models like DeepSeek will not meaningfully impact technology companies\u2019 investment plans. This suggests continued robust demand for data center infrastructure despite AI advancements. The company's \"demonstrated pricing power\" is crucial as it aims to offset the negative impacts from U.S. tariffs and raw material inflation. Success in passing these costs to customers will be key for its financial performance in the coming quarters.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSchneider Electric is an energy management giant with substantial manufacturing operations in various countries, including the United States, India, Turkiye, and Mexico. The company focuses on efficiency solutions across diverse verticals, including data centers, infrastructure, industry, and buildings. Its EcoStruxure platform offers onsite power management and decarbonization solutions for commercial and industrial facilities.

Gen Z is the least focused age group on skilled trades, largely due to misinformation. They doubt job opportunities, pay, and career paths, unlike older generations who see significant potential. Employers, facing disruptions from skilled labor shortages, are now putting less emphasis on candidates having four-year degrees.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis matters because \"skilled labor shortages are no longer hypothetical\" and are \"disrupting industries right now.\" Employers' increasing need for tradespeople, coupled with Gen Z's misperceptions, challenges a potential consensus that traditional academic paths are universally preferred.

For example, although more than half of respondents in another survey said they believe plants significantly improve indoor air quality, the effects of plants on air quality is minimal, a Drexel University paper says.\n\nIn the GPS Air survey, 41% of respondents said that odors would keep them from returning to a facility compared to 34% who said the same about a virus outbreak. \u201cThese findings illustrate how perception, particularly driven by smell and visible cues, continues to shape public understanding and expectations around indoor air quality,\u201d GPS Air says.\n\nPeople also want proof of air quality, with 61% saying they would trust a space more if they knew it monitored indoor air quality and 65% saying businesses should be required to display indoor air scores, like health ratings.\n\nGrowth in healthy building certifications, like the International WELL Building Institute\u2019s WELL rating system, launched in 2014, suggest the facility industry is responding to the growing awareness of IAQ. The rating system covers more than 6 billion square feet of real estate, representing nearly 100,000 locations and a twelve-fold increase since early 2020, IWBI said in July.\n\n\u201cThis milestone reflects a new paradigm: prioritizing health isn\u2019t a cost, it\u2019s a catalyst,\u201d IWBI President and CEO Rachel Hodgdon said in a statement. \u201cSix billion square feet is not only 13 times more than the office space in Los Angeles, it\u2019s just shy of the total commercial space of the United Kingdom. \u2026 The current scale of WELL \u2026 is staggering, and the pace of adoption is equally extraordinary.\u201d\n\nIndoor air quality affects business\n\nAbout two-thirds of respondents in GPS Air\u2019s survey said they\u2019d switch gyms for better filtration, even if it costs more, and over half said they would choose a hotel with cleaner air if they had a choice.\n\nThe preference for clean-air buildings is reflected in market trends. Buildings with healthy building certifications can earn rent premiums between 4.4% and 7.7% more per square foot than other buildings, as well as longer lease terms. \u201cBuildings that support tenant health and well-being generate greater demand and rent premiums,\u201d IWBI says.\n\n\u201cWhile consumers may not be willing to pay significantly more, they are ready to walk away from options that feel unsafe or neglected,\u201d GPS Air says. The report notes that businesses visibly prioritizing indoor air quality may gain a competitive edge, especially in industries where customers have choices.\n\n\u201cTo close this perception gap, the next frontier isn\u2019t just cleaner air, but confidence in it,\u201d GPS Air says. \u201cThat means making air quality something people can see, not just assume.\u201d\n\nAir monitoring will continue to move front and center, according to Tony Abate, vice president and chief technology at AtmosAir Solutions. Abate is a member of the ASHRAE Standards Committee and started an ASHRAE Technical Committee, TG2.IAQMP, or Indoor Air Quality Monitoring Devices.\n\n\u201cWithin about five years, I believe smart thermostats will have air quality displays on them, so there will be air monitoring in just about any space that will tell you what\u2019s going on with your indoor air quality,\u201d Abate told Facilities Dive. \u201cI think smartphones will start to incorporate indoor air quality in some very basic way. So it\u2019s important that people get ahead of that curve and start to understand what\u2019s going on in your space and what you can do about it before it becomes an emergency.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Stanley Black & Decker hikes prices again amid tariff burden, cost cuts.\n\n**Key details:** Stanley Black & Decker plans another round of price increases, described as \"more modest,\" starting in the fourth quarter after April's high single-digit hikes. The company is adjusting its supply chain to reduce China production to under 5% by end of 2026. It is also on track to achieve $2 billion in total cost savings by 2025, generating $150 million in Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:** The company aims for 35% adjusted gross margins or higher, despite Q2 being 27%. CEO Donald Allan indicated Q2 was the low point for gross margins, barring policy changes. Importantly, prior price hikes saw no noticeable demand shift, suggesting healthy customer resilience. This strategy could challenge views on the company's ability to mitigate tariffs and maintain profitability.\n\n**The big picture:** Stanley Black & Decker, the world's largest toolmaker, continues to face pressure from tariff costs, though initial impact estimates have eased. The company's core tools and outdoor division accounts for about 90% of its total revenue. Ongoing tariff volatility significantly disrupts global trade and commerce for the company. It also operates an engineered fastening division.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   $2 billion: Total cost savings target by end of 2025.\n*   27%: Gross margin in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year.\n*   $3.9 billion: Q2 revenue, a 2% decline from last year.\n*   $101.9 million: Q2 net earnings, compared to a $19.2 million loss in Q2 2024.\n*   65 cents: Expected negative EPS impact for 2025 from tariffs, after mitigation.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Stanley Black & Decker: World\u2019s largest toolmaker, implementing price hikes and supply chain adjustments.\n*   Christopher Nelson: COO, becoming CEO, discussed new price increases and supply chain strategies.\n*   Donald Allan: CEO, transitioning to executive chairman, stated Q2 was the low point for gross margins.\n*   Patrick Hallinan: CFO, updated investors on the forecasted 2025 tariff cost impact.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Company is in early talks to implement \"more modest\" price increases starting in Q4.\n*   Donald Allan is scheduled to become executive chairman, effective October.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Stanley Black & Decker tackles tariffs with price hikes and strategic cost cuts.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRelationship building is the most important skill Robert Alemany says he brings to his role as director of facilities at The Buckley School, a private K-9 school in New York City.\n\nRobert Alemany Permission granted by The Buckley School, NYC\n\nWith a background in teaching and business management, he had to learn the technical side of facility management from scratch when he shifted to that line of work about five years ago. Yet it\u2019s people management that he relies on most to succeed in his role overseeing a four-building campus of close to 400 students, he says.\n\nAmong his big challenges this year is meeting the energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One of the school\u2019s older buildings needs upgrades if it\u2019s to meet the city\u2019s tough building performance standards. To learn about his career path and how he\u2019s tackling the challenges that come with the job, Facilities Dive sat down with Alemany for a short conversation.\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nFACILITIES DIVE: How did you become involved in facilities management?\n\nROBERT ALEMANY: It was accidental. I started out teaching at public schools in different roles. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher forever and got an MBA. I thought I'd go work in finance, but I kept getting these managerial roles at educational places, then got a job at a church in New York City. The church bought a parking garage, gutted it and turned it into this really contemporary facility. They decided that Monday through Saturday they would rent it out as space and just use it for church on Sundays. They used the income from the event space to pay off the mortgage.\n\nI ran operations there for a while. They had somebody taking care of the building [who departed, then they] said, \u201cWhy don't you step into this role?\u201d I was like, \u201cI really appreciate it, but I don\u2019t know which way to hold a screwdriver, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m your guy.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe appreciate your management skills and the kind of person you are. You can get the skills to excel in this role,\u201d and they gave me a shot. I started cold calling facilities managers in similar roles, getting books and doing online courses and just loved it.\n\nA few years down the line, a position opened up at the school I\u2019m at now and I thought it was a perfect fit; I had these newly acquired facility skills and I\u2019d been a teacher. I know what they experience every day. That led me to where I am now.\n\nTalk about your training.\n\nI continue to build off what I learned and got my real estate license. I still talk to people in the field, invest in books and do online courses whenever I can. You just never stop talking to people. Even when we have vendors come in, I ask, \u201cWhy? What kind of stuff are you doing here?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important skill the job requires?\n\nPeople management, which is not something that [typically] comes to mind. When people think of facilities, they think of pipes and HVAC systems and all that. But there are people that are involved in maintaining and repairing that equipment. So it\u2019s about building relationships, especially in a city as busy as New York City. To get emergency service here, for example, relationships make a difference. We might not be on the top of the list of a company. We\u2019re just a small fish in the pond. But by building relationships, we become a priority for others. And when you have to negotiate contracts and work through different things, people skills are at the top.\n\nAre there laws or regulations that cause you the most challenge? How do you manage compliance?\n\nHere in New York City, it's Local Law 97 which is the law that's governing carbon emissions. One of the buildings was last renovated in 1974. We're fine for this year, but by 2030 we're not going to meet the threshold that they've set. We're going to be fined about $35,000 or something like that. So we're undergoing a renovation project and engaging architects and some engineers to help us with that to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nAs it relates to school buildings, some of it is health department stuff because we\u2019ve got a nurse here. So, it\u2019s making sure that chemical cleaners are away and out of reach of kids. We also face a lot of the regulations that other buildings do, but when they come in and do their inspections, they\u2019re a lot stricter with us because we\u2019re a school.\n\nWhat keeps you up at night?\n\nJust the idea that every facilities manager has: that something weird is going to go wrong, where you forgot if you did something or forgot to talk to someone. The unexpected. But that comes with the role. There\u2019s a level of unpredictability, but it drives you to be as well organized as you can and think through things. Even if something doesn\u2019t happen, you think through multiple steps and say, \u201cOkay, if it did, what would I do? How would I respond?\u201d\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone who\u2019s interested in becoming a facility manager?\n\nBe humble, ask questions and learn from those around you. There are a lot of people that have done this before, and it's not just facility managers, but those that have worked in the trades that love to share their passion for what they do. Don\u2019t try to re-create the wheel. Absorb knowledge and create friendships and relationships. If anybody would want to pursue the career, I would encourage them to do it, because it really is a great career.\n\nDid you have a unique journey into facilities management? Are you managing through challenges others could benefit from learning about? If you\u2019re interested in sharing your story with others in your field, Facilities Dive would appreciate hearing from you. Send an email to [email protected].",

A similar initiative on the operations side could halve equipment lead times for chillers in North America while normalizing inventory levels and boosting factory output, without corresponding capital investments, he said.\n\nJCI sees those efforts as key to its advantage in the high-demand data center market, where customers value shorter lead times, Weidemanis said. They could eventually extend to its slower-growing fire and security business line, he added.\n\n\u201cBeing able to deliver faster than others is an important part of our competitive advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new CEO\u2019s vision for a more efficient company apparently extends beyond sales and operations to core internal functions like accounting. The company is improving what Weidemanis called its \u201cfirst-pass yield on customers paying invoices\u201d in an effort to reduce billing error rates and improve the customer experience.\n\n\u201cIf you have a couple of percent of invoicing errors that you need to redo versus less than 1%, that not only impacts customer satisfaction, but of course, also your cash flow,\u201d he said.\n\nThese process improvements should strengthen JCI\u2019s financial position over time as the effects of the sale of its residential and light commercial business last year roll off its balance sheet and tariff impacts lessen, said Chief Financial Officer Marc Vandiepenbeeck.\n\nVandienpenbeeck described the hit from the Trump administration\u2019s on-again, off-again import tariffs as mixed but manageable. Johnson Controls has passed more of the pricing impact from tariffs to customers in markets where it had strong pricing power and less of the impact in more competitive markets, but the environment remains \u201cdynamic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s [still] a bit of uncertainty on what tariffs will do on the bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we've executed very well, but we've taken [a] conservative view into the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIn its second quarter earning report for fiscal year 2025, published about a month after Trump\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement, JCI said it would mitigate the levies\u2019 expected 2% to 3% bottom-line impact through a combination of pass-through pricing, change orders, regionalized manufacturing and investments in more resilient supply chains.\n\nDespite uncertainty around global trade flows, JCI\u2019s Americas order backlog grew 10% in the third quarter \u201cat record levels,\u201d Weidemanis said. A growth in orders for systems \u2014 such as HVAC equipment and controls \u2014 outpaced growth in orders for services, which Weidemanis flagged as a possible growth area in the coming quarters.\n\nThe CEO also noted an intent to enhance investment in research and development to accelerate innovation.\n\n\u201cIn some businesses, we can add more differentiated service products to our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we talk about investments in innovation, we are talking not only about systems but service products as well \u2026 to deliver more outcome-oriented services.\u201d\n\nBut Weidemanis also suggested JCI services and its fire and security business line could face scrutiny from the company\u2019s strategic review. JCI\u2019s focus on \u201cthe premium or more sophisticated side of the market\u201d for fire detection puts it at a disadvantage to competitors like Honeywell and Allegion, he said.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we're working away at the strategic review of the portfolio diligently [and] thoughtfully,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we have a conclusion, we will certainly let you know.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCBRE\u2019s revenue jumped 16% year over year in the second quarter, with occupiers largely proceeding to execute growth and other plans despite uncertainty in the overall economy, CEO Bob Sulentic said in the company\u2019s earnings release.\n\nThe real estate service firm\u2019s resilient businesses, including facilities management, project management, property management and other portfolio services, grew 17% year over year to $8.1 billion.\n\n\u201cResilient revenue growing faster than transactional revenue during a market recovery attests to the progress we\u2019ve made with our resilient businesses,\u201d Sulentic said in a statement. \u201cWe are especially focused on our two new segments \u2014 building operations and experience and project management \u2014 and are pleased with the progress they're making.\u201d\n\nCBRE established its Building Operations & Experience segment in January after acquiring full ownership of co-working company Industrious and integrating the project management capabilities of Turner & Townsend, which CBRE has held a majority stake in since 2021.\n\nWithin the segment, facilities management revenue increased 17% year over year, driven by strong growth across the firm\u2019s enterprise and local businesses. Enterprise growth was led by data center hyperscalers and the technology, healthcare and industrial sectors and \u201csupported by a balanced mix of new client wins and expansions, CBRE said in its earnings presentation.\n\nProperty management revenue rose 30% year over year, with contributions from Industrious enhancing the growth rate, according to CBRE. In March, the company appointed company veterans to lead the segment\u2019s Americas property management business, including Kristi Rankin \u2014 former managing director for the firm\u2019s property management business in Chicago \u2014 who was promoted to head of the U.S. property management operations.\n\nCBRE\u2019s U.S. leasing revenue grew 14% year over year, led by office and industrial sectors, according to the company\u2019s earnings report.\n\n\u201cThe leasing business is going quite well now for office buildings,\u201d Sulentic said. \u201dThe momentum is expanding from Park Avenue type locations in the gateway cities to a broader swath of the gateway cities, and now in a very big way, in the second tier markets and smaller markets below that.\u201d\n\nThis momentum is being driven by an element of a \u201creturn to the mean\u201d due to COVID being so far in the rear view mirror, and U.S. corporate clients being \u201cserious about using office space to get their employees connected, more produced, [and] more excited about the companies they work for,\u201d Sulentic said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a big plus for us in that business. You have all those things going on, [so] we expect office building leasing to continue to be strong. One of the things that\u2019s going to create is some challenges with the lack of supply in certain areas.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s new project management segment grew revenue 13% year over year, with the integration of Turner & Townsend \u201cprogressing well,\u201d Sulentic said on an earnings call. The CBRE legacy project management business saw low-double-digit growth led by the financial and energy sectors, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is notable given a slowdown in capital projects from some clients who are most impacted by the uncertain economic environment in the real estate investments segment,\u201d CBRE Chief Financial Officer Emma Giamartino said on the call. The project management segment now includes about 15,000 professionals, which CBRE \u201ccan now move \u2026 into areas in a way that we couldn\u2019t move them before,\u201d Sulentic noted.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** CBRE Sees Strong Q2 Growth, Resilient Services and Office Leasing Boost Revenue.\n\n**Key details:** CBRE reported a 16% year-over-year revenue jump in the second quarter. Resilient businesses, including facilities, project, and property management, grew 17% to $8.1 billion. The company's U.S. leasing revenue increased 14%, driven by office and industrial sectors. New segments like Building Operations & Experience and project management are progressing well, with the latter's revenue up 13%.\n\n**Why it matters:** CBRE's strong results suggest occupiers are largely proceeding with growth plans despite overall economic uncertainty. The faster growth of resilient revenue over transactional revenue during a market recovery highlights the firm's strategic progress. This performance, especially the expanding momentum in office building leasing, could challenge prevailing negative views on the commercial real estate sector's resilience and the future of office space. It indicates a \"return to the mean\" for office utilization, driven by corporate desire for connected and productive employees.\n\n**The big picture:** CBRE has been strategically expanding its service offerings, notably establishing new segments like Building Operations & Experience in January following the full acquisition of co-working company Industrious and integrating Turner & Townsend's project management capabilities. The company has also held a majority stake in Turner & Townsend since 2021. The CEO notes a \"return to the mean\" post-COVID is driving strong office leasing, as U.S. corporate clients focus on using office space for employee connection and productivity. This performance occurs despite economic uncertainty impacting capital projects for some clients.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   CBRE\u2019s revenue jumped 16% year over year in the second quarter.\n*   Resilient businesses grew 17% year over year to $8.1 billion.\n*   Property management revenue rose 30% year over year.\n*   U.S. leasing revenue grew 14% year over year.\n*   The new project management segment grew revenue 13% year over year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CBRE:** Real estate service firm reporting strong Q2 revenue jump and business segment growth.\n*   **Bob Sulentic:** CEO of CBRE, commented on strong revenue, resilient businesses, and office leasing momentum.\n*   **Industrious:** Co-working company fully acquired by CBRE, enhancing property management revenue growth.\n*   **Turner & Townsend:** Project management capabilities integrated into CBRE's new project management segment.\n*   **Kristi Rankin:** Promoted to head of CBRE's U.S. property management operations in the Americas.\n*   **Emma Giamartino:** CBRE Chief Financial Officer, noted project management growth despite capital project slowdown.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** CBRE\u2019s strong Q2 signals resilience in real estate, even surprising office demand.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nOklo announced two partnerships last week to bring its vision of efficient, nuclear-powered data centers closer to fruition.\n\nIt plans to co-develop advanced power and thermal management solutions with Vertiv, a provider of data center cooling systems and other digital infrastructure, and deploy Liberty Energy\u2019s natural gas generators and electric load management platform to power Oklo\u2019s future data center customers as federal regulators consider its advanced reactor design.\n\nIn press statements last week, executives from the three companies said the partnerships would future-proof the next generation of high-powered computing facilities, allowing them to run more efficiently and flexibly with less impact on local grids.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nData center developers are facing fierce local opposition in many parts of the United States. Data center proposals worth at least $64 billion have been blocked or delayed by community opposition, according to the activist group Data Center Watch.\n\nOpponents direct much of their ire to the impacts of onsite power generation and cooling systems on local environments and infrastructure.\n\nOnsite gas or diesel generators \u2014 which run around the clock to provide \u201cprime power\u201d at some facilities as their owners await a grid connection \u2014 are noisy and contribute to air pollution. Power demand from grid-connected data centers may fluctuate wildly in a matter of minutes, causing potentially costly power quality issues for nearby customers and the facilities themselves. Larger data centers\u2019 cooling systems can consume millions of gallons of water per day, which is one reason why the latest AI data center designs lean on closed water or non-water refrigerant loops for cooling.\n\nVertiv offers power management solutions to make \u201cdata centers good citizens on the grid,\u201d said Martin Olsen, the company\u2019s senior vice president of products and solutions. These solutions include uninterruptible power supply systems and larger batteries that help smooth out voltage fluctuations.\n\nVertiv\u2019s partnership with Oklo could boost the efficiency of high-density computing facilities more broadly, Olsen said.\n\nThe companies say they will work together to \u201cproduce end-to-end reference designs\u201d for heat recovery and cooling systems in data centers powered by Oklo\u2019s small nuclear reactors, each of which generates 5% to 10% as much energy as one of the larger reactors connected to the U.S. grid today.\n\nThose designs will closely integrate Vertiv\u2019s thermal management technology with onsite power generation, allowing facilities to recover and use heat that would otherwise go to waste, Olsen said.\n\n\u201cIn a nuclear power plant, about a third of the energy produces electricity and the rest is heat \u2026 normally, you dissipate that,\u201d he said.\n\nVertiv\u2019s thermal management system would recapture much of that heat and use it to run absorption chillers tied to facilities\u2019 liquid and air cooling systems. That could significantly reduce those systems\u2019 power consumption and cut \u201cstranded capacity\u201d \u2014 the power and mechanical capacity that would otherwise be needed to cool facilities at periods of peak demand \u2014 by 10% to 20%, Olsen said.\n\nData centers could simply bank the energy savings and use less power overall, but it\u2019s more likely they\u2019d run more GPUs instead, Olsen added.\n\nIt may be several years before a data center customer has the opportunity. The companies plan to demonstrate the co-designed power and thermal management solution with Oklo\u2019s first reactor deployment at Idaho National Laboratory.\n\nOklo executives say that reactor could power up in late 2027 or early 2028. They have not said whether it would be colocated with a data center or other power offtaker, though the Trump administration last week identified Idaho National Laboratory as one of four U.S. Department of Energy sites it wants to host \u201ccutting edge data center and power generation projects.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Oklo\u2019s collaboration with Liberty Energy and a previously announced partnership with RPower would deliver \u201cbridge power\u201d to future data center customers eager to power up before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves its reactor design. Both companies make small, flexible gas-fired generators that can run continuously to provide primary power to off-grid facilities or back up a grid connection and other onsite power sources as needed.\n\nThe Oklo-Liberty announcement suggested Oklo\u2019s reactors would relegate the gas generators to a backup role over time. But, as part of the partnership, Liberty said it would provide load management solutions that enable \u201cflexible energy services\u201d in the short term and \u201cfuture grid management services focused on optimization and resiliency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis collaboration gives large-scale power users a turnkey alternative that integrates generation, backup, grid interaction, and optimization, all through a single provider,\u201d Oklo cofounder and CEO Jacob DeWitte said in a statement.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Oklo Forges Key Partnerships for Nuclear-Powered Data Center Future\n\n**Key details:**\nOklo has announced two new partnerships aimed at developing efficient, nuclear-powered data centers. One partnership is with Vertiv, focusing on co-developing advanced power and thermal management solutions for Oklo\u2019s nuclear-powered facilities. The second collaboration is with Liberty Energy, which will deploy natural gas generators and an electric load management platform to provide \"bridge power\" for Oklo\u2019s data center customers while federal regulators review its reactor design. These initiatives seek to create more efficient and flexible high-powered computing facilities.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe news is significant because it directly addresses the fierce local opposition currently faced by data center developers, who encounter challenges with onsite power generation and cooling systems. Current data centers often use noisy, polluting generators and consume vast amounts of water, leading to delays and blockages of projects. Oklo's partnerships offer solutions by proposing nuclear power, advanced heat recovery systems that significantly reduce power consumption, and flexible gas generators for optimization. This could challenge the current consensus that data centers are inherently high-impact and difficult to integrate into local grids, potentially easing community resistance and improving grid stability.\n\n**The big picture:**\nData center developers are experiencing strong local opposition across the United States, with proposals worth at least $64 billion stalled or blocked due to community concerns. These concerns largely stem from the environmental and infrastructural impacts of onsite power generation and cooling. Gas or diesel generators used for prime power are often noisy and contribute to air pollution. Additionally, large data centers' cooling systems can consume millions of gallons of water daily and cause costly power quality issues due to fluctuating demand.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   At least $64 billion: Value of data center proposals blocked or delayed by community opposition.\n*   5% to 10%: Energy generated by Oklo's small nuclear reactors compared to larger U.S. grid reactors.\n*   10% to 20%: Potential reduction in \"stranded capacity\" for cooling systems through heat recovery.\n*   Late 2027 or early 2028: When Oklo's first reactor deployment at Idaho National Laboratory could power up.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Oklo:** Announced partnerships to advance its vision of efficient, nuclear-powered data centers.\n*   **Vertiv:** Provider of digital infrastructure, partnering to co-develop thermal management for data centers.\n*   **Liberty Energy:** Will deploy natural gas generators and load management for Oklo\u2019s future data center customers.\n*   **RPower:** Previously announced partner, makes small gas-fired generators to deliver \"bridge power.\"\n*   **Data Center Watch:** Activist group tracking data center proposals blocked or delayed by community opposition.\n*   **Martin Olsen:** Vertiv's senior vice president of products and solutions, commented on the partnership's efficiency boost.\n*   **Jacob DeWitte:** Oklo cofounder and CEO, stated the collaboration offers a turnkey alternative for power users.\n*   **U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission:** Federal body considering approval of Oklo's advanced reactor design.\n*   **Trump administration:** Identified Idaho National Laboratory as a site for cutting-edge data center and power generation projects.\n*   **Idaho National Laboratory:** Site where Oklo plans its first reactor deployment and demonstration of co-designed solutions.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Oklo's first reactor deployment at Idaho National Laboratory could power up in late 2027 or early 2028.\n*   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of Oklo's advanced reactor design is pending.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nOklo's partnerships tackle data center power issues with nuclear and flexible energy solutions.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nHerm\u00e8s reported consolidated revenue of 8 billion euros , or about $9.2 billion, up 7% year over year for the first half of fiscal 2025, according to a Wednesday release.\n\nSecond quarter revenue rose 5.6% to 3.9 billion euros, representing a slowdown from a 9% year-over-year increase in the first quarter and from the nearly 18% revenue uptick seen in the last quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nAll geographies reported overall first half revenue increases, although regional growth was more moderate in Q2 than in recent quarters. Leather Goods and Saddlery posted an 11.3% increase for the half, but watches were down nearly 9% for the period.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile luxury firms, such as Kering and LVMH, have reported revenue declines amid sector difficulties, Herm\u00e8s continues to post year-over-year increases.\n\n\u201cHerm\u00e8s has consistently focused on scarcity, craftsmanship, and brand equity, rather than chasing aggressive volume growth,\u201d Yanmei Tang, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge, said in emailed comments. \u201cIts approach appears well-suited to a market where high-end consumers are becoming more selective and emotionally connected to brands.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, revenue was up 10.7% to 1.8 billion euros for the first half, although second quarter revenue in France grew only 4.1%, down from 14.2% growth in the country in the first quarter. In the Middle East, revenue rose 16.3% to 362 million euros.\n\nThe Americas were up 9.5% to 1.5 billion euros, with a 6.3% increase in the second quarter that came despite the company\u2019s price increases in the U.S., which Herm\u00e8s instituted to offset tariffs. On a call with analysts, Axel Dumas, executive chairman of Herm\u00e8s, said that the company was waiting for more clarification on the new U.S./EU tariff structure, but for the moment the company did not plan any additional price increases.\n\nAsia was up 4.2% to 4.4 billion euros in H1, mainly due to a 17.6% year-over-year uptick in Japan. The Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan was up only 1.5% for the first half, and nearly flat in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe solid first-half results across all regions reflect the strength of the Herm\u00e8s model,\u201d Dumas said in the release. \u201cI would like to thank all our customers for their trust and all our employees for their commitment. We will continue to invest and recruit to ensure the group\u2019s sustained success.\u201d\n\nTang said that while the overall luxury market in China is cooling, Herm\u00e8s has avoided heavy promotional campaigns and has not overextended itself in terms of product range or store expansion.\n\n\u201cThe brand\u2019s disciplined retail strategy and selective investment in China are also paying off,\u201d Tang said. \u201cRather than flooding the market, Herm\u00e8s has maintained a focused footprint and high store productivity. Our experts say this has helped the brand avoid the fatigue now visible in some of its competitors.\u201d\n\nTang said that looking ahead, Herm\u00e8s may be better positioned to weather market volatility than some of its peers, which are undergoing leadership changes or restructuring.\n\n\u201cHerm\u00e8s is expected to maintain internal stability over the next three to five years,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThis continuity, combined with its ability to execute targeted product launches and deepen relationships with existing clients, may allow the brand to continue gaining market share even in a flat or slow-growth environment.\u201d",

Second quarter revenue rose 5.6% to 3.9 billion euros, representing a slowdown from a 9% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. While all geographies reported overall first half revenue increases, regional growth was more moderate in Q2, and watches were down nearly 9% for the period.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information might challenge the current consensus view on the luxury sector. While other luxury firms, such as Kering and LVMH, have reported revenue declines amid sector difficulties, Herm\u00e8s continues to post year-over-year increases. Its approach, focusing on scarcity, craftsmanship, and brand equity rather than aggressive volume growth, appears well-suited to a market where high-end consumers are becoming more selective. The brand\u2019s disciplined retail strategy and selective investment in markets like China are also described as paying off, helping avoid fatigue seen in some competitors.\n\n**The big picture:** The overall luxury market is experiencing difficulties, with high-end consumers becoming more selective and the market in China cooling. In this environment, Herm\u00e8s has maintained its performance by avoiding heavy promotional campaigns and not overextending its product range or store expansion. This strategy contrasts with some of its peers, which are undergoing leadership changes or restructuring.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Consolidated revenue H1 FY2025: 8 billion euros (up 7% YOY)\n*   Second quarter revenue growth: 5.6% (slowdown from 9% in Q1)\n*   Leather Goods and Saddlery H1 increase: 11.3%\n*   Watches H1 decrease: 9%\n*   Asia H1 revenue: 4.4 billion euros (up 4.2%)\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Herm\u00e8s:** Luxury firm continuing to post year-over-year revenue increases despite sector difficulties.\n*   **Kering:** Luxury firm that has reported revenue declines amid current sector difficulties.\n*   **LVMH:** Luxury firm that has reported revenue declines amid current sector difficulties.\n*   **Yanmei Tang:** Analyst at Third Bridge, providing commentary on Herm\u00e8s' strategic market success.\n*   **Third Bridge:** Research firm employing analyst Yanmei Tang, offering insights on the luxury market.\n*   **Axel Dumas:** Executive chairman of Herm\u00e8s, commented on the company\u2019s solid first-half results and future investments.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Herm\u00e8s is expected to maintain internal stability over the next three to five years.\n*   The company plans to continue targeted product launches and deepen relationships with existing clients.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Herm\u00e8s' disciplined strategy drives growth, outperforming a challenging luxury market.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe topic of tariffs loomed over Steve Madden\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, with company executives citing second quarter challenges including canceled wholesale orders, reduced open-to-buys and shipment delays.\n\nSteven Madden is still focused on diversifying its sourcing base, an initiative it started after President Donald Trump was reelected last November. In its first quarter, the company said it planned to only source a mid-teens percentage of goods from China.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, Chairman and CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company moved some of its production back to China for the fall because \u201cwe felt it would be difficult to ensure on-time delivery, appropriate product quality and/or reasonable pricing\u201d if it sourced from another country.\n\nFor fall 2025, Steve Madden expects to source about 30% of its imports from China, down from 71% a year ago, per the call. Rosenfeld said Steve Madden\u2019s China sourcing percentage is currently in the low 60s. He attributed the change to shifting tariff rates between the U.S. and China, which at one point were as high as 145%.\n\nSteve Madden previously planned to move some of its China sourcing to Brazil, but following Trump\u2019s announcement of a 40% tariff on the South American country, the company plans to \u201cwait and see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just for Brazil, but for a lot of countries that we work with,\u201d Rosenfeld said.\n\nTo make up for some of the tariff impact, Steve Madden has selectively raised prices for wholesale customers and individual consumers, with price increases averaging about 10%.\n\nSo far, customers have been receptive to price increases, but Rosenfeld cautioned it was still early, and the company would continue to monitor consumer demand.\n\nTariffs have always been a particular challenge for Steve Madden. Unlike some other apparel and footwear companies, it used to source about 80% of its products from China. Mexico, another target for Trump tariffs, also was a large portion of Steve Madden\u2019s sourcing base, Fashion Dive previously reported.\n\nDespite these challenges, Steve Madden still logged a revenue increase for Q2 with $559 million, a 6.8% year-over-year increase. This was mainly due to the newly acquired Kurt Geiger brand. Without Kurt Geiger, revenue would have fallen 10%, according to Jefferies analysts led by Corey Tarlowe.\n\nSteve Madden reported a Q2 loss from operations of $40.3 million or a 7.2% decrease of revenue, compared to income from operations of $46.9 million last year.\n\n\u201cOur financial performance in the second quarter was not up to our usual standards as we grappled with the impact of tariffs, and we know the path forward will continue to be bumpy in the near term,\u201d Rosenfeld said.\n\nThe largest tariff-related impact was seen in mass and off-price channels. Rosenfeld said that about 95% of the wholesale revenue shortfall of the business came from these segments.\n\nRosenfeld declined to give guidance for the company\u2019s performance expectations for the next quarter or the full year, but said the tariff situation would make a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Q3 and would hopefully improve by Q4.\n\nSteve Madden\u2019s overall wholesale business fell 6.4% year over year. Without Kurt Geiger, it would have fallen 12.8%. DTC revenue rose 43.3%, or fell 3% excluding Kurt Geiger.\n\n\u201cWhile the systems migration is fully behind them, the tariff-related demand impact is likely to remain at least through the end of the year,\u201d Tom Nikic, managing director of Needham & Company, said in a client note.\n\nIn addition to Kurt Geiger and its namesake brand, Steve Madden also owns Almost Famous, Dolce Vita and Betsey Johnson.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Tariffs force Steve Madden to shift sourcing, face Q2 loss.\n\n**Key details:** Steve Madden's second quarter faced challenges including canceled wholesale orders and shipment delays due to tariffs. The company moved some fall production back to China, citing difficulties ensuring timely delivery and quality elsewhere. Steve Madden reported a $40.3 million Q2 loss from operations, despite overall revenue rising 6.8% to $559 million, driven solely by the Kurt Geiger acquisition. To counter tariffs, Steve Madden selectively raised prices for customers by about 10%. The company expects continued \"bumpy\" performance in the near term.\n\n**Why it matters:** This news highlights tariffs' significant financial impact, leading to Steve Madden's Q2 loss from operations. The decision to revert some production to China challenges prior diversification plans, showing the difficulty of finding viable alternative sourcing. This move, alongside new tariffs on Brazil, signals that reducing reliance on China is harder and more costly than anticipated. The company's refusal to provide future guidance further underscores the ongoing uncertainty for investors.\n\n**The big picture:** Tariffs have consistently challenged Steve Madden, which historically sourced about 80% of its products from China. The company began diversifying its sourcing base after President Donald Trump's re-election. Shifting tariff rates between the U.S. and China, at one point reaching 145%, have heavily influenced sourcing decisions. Mexico, another target for Trump tariffs, also previously formed a large portion of Steve Madden's sourcing.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $559 million, up 6.8% year-over-year.\n*   Q2 loss from operations: $40.3 million, a 7.2% decrease of revenue.\n*   China sourcing: Expected 30% for fall 2025, down from 71% a year ago.\n*   Price increases: Averaged about 10% for wholesale and individual customers.\n*   Wholesale business: Fell 6.4% year-over-year; would have fallen 12.8% without Kurt Geiger.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Steve Madden:** Footwear and accessories company grappling with significant tariff impacts on its sourcing and financials.\n*   **Edward Rosenfeld:** Chairman and CEO of Steve Madden, discussed the company's Q2 challenges and strategic responses.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President whose re-election and tariff policies significantly influenced Steve Madden\u2019s sourcing decisions.\n*   **Kurt Geiger:** Newly acquired brand critical for Steve Madden\u2019s Q2 revenue growth, offsetting declines elsewhere.\n*   **Jefferies:** Financial firm whose analysts, led by Corey Tarlowe, provided specific revenue analysis for Steve Madden.\n*   **Corey Tarlowe:** Jefferies analyst who provided insights on Steve Madden's Q2 revenue performance.\n*   **Needham & Company:** Financial firm whose managing director commented on the ongoing tariff-related demand impact.\n*   **Tom Nikic:** Needham & Company managing director, noted tariff impacts are likely to remain through year-end.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for the \"significant impact\" of tariffs on Steve Madden's Q3 performance.\n*   Monitor if the tariff situation \"hopefully improve[s] by Q4\" as suggested, and ongoing consumer demand.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Tariffs severely impact Steve Madden, forcing sourcing shifts and financial losses.",

The change means low-cost imports will be subject to all applicable duties, including the various tariffs that have been installed by the Trump administration.\n\nAn exception is provided for imported goods sent through the international postal network. Postal packages will instead be assessed duties based on one of two methodologies:\n\nAn ad valorem duty assessed on the value of each package equal to tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The applied tariff is based on the product's country of origin. A duty ranging from $80 to $200 per item, depending on the effective IEEPA tariff rate for the product's country of origin. This methodology will be available for six months, after which applicable shipments must comply with the ad valorem duty.\n\n\"The postal channel has always been difficult, namely because of the lack of traceability and the amount of consumer to consumer volume that is shipped there,\" said Hugo Pakula, CEO of supply chain compliance solutions provider Tru Identity, in a LinkedIn post Wednesday.\n\nThe end of the exemption will help the U.S. prevent importers from avoiding tariffs and combat the entry of drugs and \"other unsafe or below-market products\" that cause harm, per the fact sheet. Ninety percent of all cargo seizures in fiscal year 2024 originated as de minimis shipments, according to the White House.\n\n\"Packages entering the United States using the duty-free de minimis exemption are typically subject to less scrutiny than traditional imports; however, the packages can pose health, safety, national and economic security risks,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nThe de minimis exemption will remain in place for U.S. residents bringing back up to $200 in items bought during travel, as well as \"bona fide gifts\" of $100 or less, per the White House.\n\nThe Trump administration said earlier this year it planned to end the exemption for trading partners once systems were in place to collect duty revenue. The U.S. already removed the exemption for imports from China \u2014 a popular origin country for de minimis shipments \u2014 and Hong Kong in May.\n\nPrior to Wednesday's announcement, the exemption had been slated to end in 2027 as part of a sweeping policy bill signed by Trump earlier this month.",

The two groups entered a written agreement in 2023 that the university would not use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name alone.\n\nLast year, Columbia University\u2019s webstore offered for sale shirts, sweatshirts and hats that bare the word \u201cColumbia\u201d on its own, which attorneys for Columbia Sportswear say violate the contract and its trademark rights.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nColumbia Sportswear is seeking a jury trial in the complaint against Columbia University. It also asks that the university be prevented from using the trademark name alone on apparel and accessories, along with recalling any such products currently in the university\u2019s possession. The brand also is seeking monetary damages.\n\nIn 2023, the sportswear company said the two groups entered a written agreement whereby the university could use the \u201cColumbia\u201d name, for which the sportswear company has a trademark, if the name was used with one other distinguishing mark associated with the university, such as its shield, crown or lion mascot logo, or words, such as \u201cuniversity,\u201d \u201cColumbia Law,\u201d or its year of founding.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.

Retrieved from Court Filing\n\n\u201cThough Columbia Sportswear and Nike are headquartered in the same State and are both highly reputable sporting apparel designers and have a generally friendly relationship, the two companies have never collaborated to jointly design, manufacture, market, or sell any product,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA consumer looking at the Infringing Merchandise would never know that, and, in fact, would reasonably be induced into believing the companies had.\u201d\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this case will be settled out of court, and fairly quickly, said Josh Gerben, trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Columbia Sportswear\u2019s version of the story in the complaint is not entirely accurate, and Columbia University decides to defend the case, things could get interesting,\u201d Gerben said in an email. \u201cThis is because Columbia University has been around much longer than Columbia Sportswear. It gives the university some very interesting defenses to the overall claims regarding trademark infringement.\u201d\n\nColumbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday. In Q1, the company reported a net sales increase of 1% to $778.5 million.

The university's webstore offered shirts, sweatshirts, and hats last year bearing \"Columbia\" alone, allegedly violating the contract.

This agreement stipulated that the name must be used with a distinguishing mark, such as its shield, crown, lion mascot, or words like \"university\" or \"Law.\" Columbia Sportswear alleges the university violated this agreement by selling products with the name \"Columbia\" alone.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   1%: Columbia Sportswear's Q1 net sales increase.\n*   $778.5 million: Columbia Sportswear's Q1 net sales.\n*   2023: Year the written agreement was entered between the two parties.\n*   Last week: When the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Columbia Sportswear:** Filed a lawsuit against the university for trademark infringement and breach of contract.\n*   **Columbia University:** Sued for allegedly violating a 2023 agreement by using \"Columbia\" name alone.\n*   **Nike:** Its logo appeared on some Columbia University apparel mentioned in the trademark infringement lawsuit.\n*   **Champion:** Its logo was on university apparel, contributing to claims of customer confusion by Sportswear.\n*   **Josh Gerben:** Trademark attorney who commented on the likely out-of-court settlement of the lawsuit.\n*   **Columbia University spokesperson:** Declined to comment on the pending litigation mentioned in the article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Columbia Sportswear is set to announce its second quarter earnings Thursday.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nColumbia Sportswear's lawsuit challenges brand control and customer perception.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThom Browne CEO Rodrigo Bazan is stepping down from his role effective Aug. 31, according to a Wednesday press release from parent company Ermenegildo Zegna Group.\n\nBazan has led the Thom Browne brand since 2016. Sam Lobban, who is currently executive vice president and general merchandising manager for apparel and designer at Nordstrom, will succeed Bazan on Sept. 2, per the release.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day Zegna Group reported a 3% year-over-year revenue decline to 927.7 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, for the first half of fiscal 2025. Revenue for Thom Browne was down 22.4% for the period to 129.5 million euros, per a separate release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nZegna Group acquired a majority stake in Thom Browne Inc. in 2018. At the time, the brand was valued at about $500 million, and Bazan, who was the brand\u2019s CEO, continued in the role.\n\n\u201cOver the past nine years, I have been working side by side with Rodrigo, and together we have developed Thom Browne from a niche brand into today\u2019s luxury icon of modern tailoring,\u201d Thom Browne, chief creative officer and founder of his namesake brand, said in the release. \u201cI am profoundly grateful for his unwavering support and dedication throughout this extraordinary journey.\u201d\n\nSince its acquisition, Thom Browne\u2019s revenue has nearly tripled, according to Zegna Group\u2019s Chairman and CEO Ermenegildo \u201cGildo\u201d Zegna.\n\n\u201cRodrigo\u2019s entrepreneurial vision, along with his pivotal role in Thom Browne\u2019s defense of its intellectual property rights against Adidas, has been instrumental in protecting and reinforcing the brand\u2019s authentic and unique identity,\u201d Zegna said in the release announcing Bazan\u2019s departure.\n\nHowever, the brand has been struggling for a while. Thom Browne revenue dropped 16.8% year over year to 315 million euros in fiscal 2024, and revenue declined 19% in the first quarter of 2025. The company attributed declines at the Thom Browne brand to a decision to reduce exposure in the wholesale channel, and in Q1, the brand posted a 48% year-over-year wholesale drop.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Zegna Group said in its release that revenue declines at Thom Browne continued to be \u201csignificantly affected by the performance of the wholesale channel, which more than offset the growth recorded in the DTC channel.\u201d\n\nThe company added that the brand has been streamlining its wholesale channel presence to focus on direct distribution.\n\n\u201cLeading Thom Browne over the past 9 years has been an extraordinary journey,\u201d said Bazan in the release, adding that while he had decided to \u201cstep down to focus on new opportunities,\u201d he would \u201calways remain connected and supportive of the brand\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lobban, prior to his time at Nordstrom, worked at Selfridges in London, and was part of Mr Porter\u2019s founding team, per the release. While at Nordstrom, he curated brand collaborations, which included work with Thom Browne.\n\nBrowne said in the release that Lobban\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of [the] brand\u2019s distinctive DNA and his visionary approach make him the ideal partner to help shape the future of our brand.\u201d\n\nZegna Group sold 14.1 million treasury shares to Temasek Holdings on Tuesday. The Singapore-based firm now holds 10% of Zegna Group.",

Sam Lobban, previously executive vice president at Nordstrom, will succeed him on September 2. This leadership change occurs as parent Ermenegildo Zegna Group reported a 3% year-over-year revenue decline for the first half of fiscal 2025. Thom Browne specifically saw its revenue drop 22.4% for the same period to 129.5 million euros. The brand's struggles are attributed to a decision to reduce exposure in the wholesale channel.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe CEO transition at Thom Browne comes amidst a significant period of declining revenue, challenging any perception of continuous strong growth. The brand's revenue has dropped for multiple periods, including 16.8% in fiscal 2024 and 19% in the first quarter of 2025. This downturn is explicitly linked to a strategic decision to streamline the wholesale channel. The new leadership faces the immediate task of navigating these continued performance challenges, which could impact investor expectations for the brand's near-term growth.\n\n**The big picture:**\nErmenegildo Zegna Group acquired a majority stake in Thom Browne Inc. in 2018, valuing the brand at approximately $500 million.

Bazan was praised for developing the brand into a \"luxury icon of modern tailoring\" and for defending its intellectual property rights against Adidas.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nPrada Group revenue rose 8% to 2.7 billion euros , or about $3.1 billion, for the first half of fiscal 2025, according to a Wednesday release.\n\nGroup retail sales rose 8% to 2.5 billion euros for the period, while wholesale sales fell 2% to 220 million euros, and royalties rose 10% to 67 million euros. Every region reported sales growth.\n\nMiu Miu also reported growth, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in the previous quarter . The brand posted a 40% year-over-year retail sales increase in Q2 and 49% overall growth for H1. Meanwhile, retail sales at the Prada brand fell 3.6% in Q2 and 1.9% in H1. Brand retail sales were posted in constant currency.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDeclining retail sales at Prada underpinned the announcement that the brand's CEO Gianfranco D\u2019Attis was exiting the company by mutual agreement, effective June 30. D\u2019Attis spent just over two years in the role, and Prada Group CEO Andrea Guerra will succeed him in an interim capacity until a permanent appointment is made.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s release, Guerra in part attributed Prada Group\u2019s solid second quarter performance and strong first half to the cultural relevance of the company\u2019s brands. He added that the Prada brand \u201cshowed resilience against increasingly subdued demand dynamics and high comps,\u201d while Miu Miu showed \u201csustainable growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain headwinds are likely to be more cyclical than structural, but it is essential to execute with focus,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cLooking ahead, while being vigilant and nimble, we remain committed to our strategy and to our ambition to deliver solid, sustainable and above-market growth.\u201d\n\nBy region, retail sales in Asia Pacific were solid throughout Q2 and increased 8% to 838 million euros for the first half of the year. In Europe, the company said second quarter sales were impacted by lower tourist spending and tough comps, offset by stable local demand, which led to an overall 7% sales increase to 728 million euros in H1.\n\nSales in the Americas rose 10% in the first half. Japan experienced a deceleration in the second quarter after posting an 18% year-over-year uptick in Q1, leading to a 6% increase in the first half to 326 million euros.\n\nSales in the Middle East grew 24% to 137 million euros in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cIn the first half of the year we delivered a sound set of results, testament to the strength of our brands and disciplined execution,\u201d Patrizio Bertelli, Prada Group\u2019s chairman and executive director, said in the release. \u201cThis healthy performance was achieved against a challenging backdrop, somewhat unprecedented in our industry. We believe the structural growth opportunities remain unchanged, but we are conscious that in the short term we may continue to face a turbulent economic environment.\u201d",

Group retail sales increased 8%, while wholesale sales fell 2%, and royalties were up 10%. Miu Miu reported significant growth, with retail sales up 40% in Q2 and 49% overall in H1. Conversely, retail sales for the Prada brand fell 3.6% in Q2 and 1.9% in H1. This decline led to the mutual agreement exit of Prada brand CEO Gianfranco D\u2019Attis, effective June 30.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe strong overall group performance and Miu Miu's exceptional growth contrast sharply with the declining sales of the flagship Prada brand. This specific brand underperformance, highlighted by the CEO's departure, suggests that even within a successful luxury conglomerate, individual brand health can vary significantly. It challenges a potential consensus that all luxury segments or brands within a strong group are equally robust, indicating specific vulnerability for Prada brand amidst \"subdued demand dynamics.\" The company acknowledges a \"challenging backdrop\" for the industry.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPrada Group delivered a \"sound set of results\" for the first half, attributed by CEO Andrea Guerra to the cultural relevance of its brands and disciplined execution.

The sale amount was undisclosed. B&G intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including paying debt and purchasing assets. This deal marks the latest vegetable brand divestiture for B&G.\n\n**Why it matters:** The sale represents B&G's continued progress in reshaping its portfolio, sharpening focus on core brands, and reducing long-term debt. B&G is prioritizing divesting brands with lower margins, high working capital needs, or those not fitting core capabilities. This strategic shift challenges any previous consensus that B&G would continue its pattern as a \"serial acquirer\" across all food categories, especially mature, high working capital ones like canned vegetables.\n\n**The big picture:** B&G Foods, once a serial acquirer, has been actively divesting vegetable brands in recent years. This includes two tomato lines and its Green Giant U.S. canned vegetable business. The company previously stated canned vegetables are a mature category with high working capital needs, requiring increased debt for seasonal inventory. B&G CEO Casey Keller mentioned that the company had been evaluating divestitures in the frozen and canned vegetable space for two years.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Le Sueur brand sold for an undisclosed amount.\n*   Green Giant U.S. canned vegetable business was divested in late 2023.\n*   B&G Foods was evaluating divestiture of vegetable brands two years ago.\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   B&G Foods: Sold Le Sueur, aiming to reshape its portfolio and reduce long-term debt.\n*   McCall Farms: Acquired B&G Foods' Le Sueur brand of premium sweet peas, green beans, and carrots.\n*   Casey Keller: B&G Foods President and CEO, stated the sale continues portfolio reshaping efforts.\n*   Seneca Foods: Acquired B&G Foods' Green Giant U.S. canned vegetable business in late 2023.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** B&G sheds mature brands to sharpen focus and reduce debt.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nKering revenue declined 16% year over year to 7.6 billion euros for the first half of fiscal 2025, or about $8.8 billion, according to a Tuesday press release.\n\nSecond quarter revenue sank 18% year over year to 3.7 billion euros, following a first quarter year-over-year decline of 14% . Net income plummeted 46% to 474 million euros for the half.\n\nAt Gucci, first half revenue sank 26% to 3 billion euros, and first half recurring operating income nosedived 51% year over year to 486 million euros. Gucci also posted a 25% sales decrease in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIt\u2019s been a turbulent year for Kering, both fiscally and in terms of its leadership and creative teams.\n\nThe company named a new CEO, who will succeed Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault following a board vote in September. In addition, the company named Pierpaolo Piccioli as the new creative director at Balenciaga in May, following the departure of Demna Gvasalia, who became the new artistic director of Gucci in March. Those changes followed the December 2024 hire of Louise Trotter as creative director at Bottega Veneta.\n\nIn 2024, Kering also appointed new CEOs at Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Gucci.\n\nThe company has also made changes on its operational and financial fronts, Pinault said in Tuesday\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cIn a particularly tough market environment, we continued to streamline our distribution and cost base, and, executing on our roadmap, we took decisive steps to strengthen our financial structure,\u201d Pinault said. \u201cThough the numbers we are reporting remain well below our potential, we are certain that our comprehensive efforts of the past two years have set healthy foundations for the next stages in Kering\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nKering quarterly revenue since Q1 2023 Chart represents year-over-year % changes and total revenue in dollars.\n\nHowever, the luxury company\u2019s leadership instability was concerning, said Yanmei Tang, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge.\n\n\u201cKering has changed designers across its three main brands simultaneously, a risky move given the group\u2019s reliance on figures like [Deputy CEO] Francesca Bellettini, who holds significant sway over appointments and brand direction,\u201d Tang said in emailed comments. \u201cThis top-heavy approach often leads to reactive, short-term decisions aimed at plugging immediate gaps, in contrast to LVMH\u2019s longer-term, structured leadership model.\u201d\n\nKering is also facing a tough reality in its two main luxury markets, China and the United States, Tang said.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s consumers have become cautious, preferring to save rather than spend on luxury, while the US market is wobbling under political unpredictability that is clouding consumer confidence,\u201d Tang said, adding that product desirability is now a bigger problem for Kering than any tariff threat.\n\n\u201cDesirable brands like Herm\u00e8s can nudge prices higher without hurting demand, but brands such as Saint Laurent and Gucci do not currently enjoy that level of pricing power,\u201d Tang said. \u201cOur experts point out that creative stagnation is not helping, with designers spending much of their time mining archives rather than bringing fresh ideas to the market.\u201d\n\nKering\u2019s second quarter retail sales were down 16% year over year, and down double digits in every region. In North America, retail sales fell 10%, while in Asia-Pacific they were down 19%. Meanwhile, in Western Europe sales sank 17%, and Japan retail sales fell an eyewatering 29%, which Kering attributed to a sharp decline in tourism.\n\nAt Yves Saint Laurent, first half revenue was down 11% to 1.3 billion euros. Revenue from the Kering\u2019s other houses, including jewelry brands and fashion houses Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, declined 15% to 1.5 billion euros for the same period. Bottega Veneta revenue rose 1% to 846 million euros for the period.\n\nBut the biggest problem for Kering is at Gucci, where losses continue to deepen following last year\u2019s steep revenue declines.\n\n\u201cTurning Gucci around will take time,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThe brand needs at least two to three collections to stabilise under new creative leadership, especially as any change in designer inevitably risks alienating existing clients while trying to cultivate a new audience.\u201d",

Second quarter revenue sank 18% and net income plummeted 46% for the half. Its flagship brand, Gucci, saw first half revenue decline 26% to 3 billion euros, with recurring operating income falling 51%. Gucci's sales also decreased 25% in Q2, contributing significantly to Kering's financial downturn.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nKering's significant financial declines, particularly at Gucci, highlight deep-seated issues beyond a tough market environment. Analyst Yanmei Tang points to concerning leadership instability and a \"top-heavy\" approach to appointments, which contrasts with LVMH\u2019s structured model. This challenges a potential view that market conditions are the sole problem, suggesting Kering's internal strategy and \"creative stagnation\" are major hurdles. Tang also notes that Kering's product desirability and pricing power are weaker than competitors like Herm\u00e8s, indicating a struggle to maintain brand appeal. Turning around Gucci, the biggest problem, will \"take time\" and risks alienating existing clients.\n\n**The big picture:**\nKering has faced a turbulent year marked by significant leadership and creative team changes across its major brands. New CEOs were appointed at Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and Gucci in 2024, alongside new creative directors at Balenciaga, Gucci, and Bottega Veneta. CEO Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault stated the company has been streamlining distribution and costs, and strengthening its financial structure over the past two years. However, the luxury company is also contending with a tough market environment, as consumers in China are cautious and the U.S. market is wobbling due to political unpredictability. Retail sales declined double digits in all regions, including a 29% drop in Japan attributed to tourism.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Kering H1 FY25 revenue: 7.6 billion euros, down 16% year over year.\n*   Kering H1 net income: 474 million euros, a 46% decline.\n*   Gucci H1 revenue: 3 billion euros, down 26%, with recurring operating income down 51%.\n*   Kering Q2 retail sales: down 16% overall, with Japan down an \"eyewatering\" 29%.\n*   Bottega Veneta H1 revenue: 846 million euros, up 1%.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Kering:** Luxury group reporting significant revenue and net income declines across its brands.\n*   **Gucci:** Kering's largest brand, facing steep revenue declines and a challenging turnaround.\n*   **Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault:** Kering's current CEO, stating efforts have set healthy foundations amidst tough numbers.\n*   **Pierpaolo Piccioli:** Appointed as the new creative director at Kering's Balenciaga brand in May.\n*   **Balenciaga:** Kering brand that appointed a new creative director and also a new CEO.\n*   **Demna Gvasalia:** Became the new artistic director of Gucci in March, formerly Balenciaga's creative director.\n*   **Bottega Veneta:** Kering brand showing a 1% revenue rise, hired a new creative director.\n*   **Louise Trotter:** Hired as creative director at Kering's Bottega Veneta brand in December 2024.\n*   **Saint Laurent:** Kering brand that appointed a new CEO and experienced an 11% H1 revenue drop.\n*   **Third Bridge:** Research firm whose analyst provided critical insights on Kering's leadership instability.\n*   **Yanmei Tang:** Analyst from Third Bridge, concerned about Kering's \"top-heavy\" leadership approach.\n*   **Francesca Bellettini:** Kering Deputy CEO, noted for significant sway over appointments and brand direction.\n*   **LVMH:** Competitor mentioned for its structured, longer-term leadership model, contrasting with Kering's.\n*   **Herm\u00e8s:** Competitor able to raise prices without hurting demand, unlike some Kering brands.\n*   **Alexander McQueen:** Kering fashion house mentioned among \"other houses\" with revenue declines.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The board vote in September to confirm the successor to Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as Kering CEO.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nKering's steep declines signal deeper brand and leadership challenges.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nA brewing storm of climate change and tariffs has sent coffee prices soaring and accelerated interest in bean-free alternatives.\n\nDroughts in Vietnam and Brazil have decimated coffee crops, sending prices up to an all-time high earlier this year. Producers are now bracing for the prospect of even higher costs if new tariffs from the Trump administration go into effect next month on top coffee producing countries.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper and J.M. Smucker, which owns Folgers and Cafe Bustelo, have both raised prices as costs continue to escalate. Since last October, Smucker has raised coffee prices at least three times, with plans to hike them a fourth time this August, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nFor food tech companies and startups working on coffee alternatives, escalating prices could position bean-free substitutes as a cheaper, more sustainable option.\n\n\u201cThis can only happen now; 10, 20 years ago \u2026 there weren't those supply chain shocks,\u201d said Jake Berber, cofounder of Prefer, a Singapore-based startup that turns food waste into bean-free, ground coffee. \u201cToday, for the first time, we can create this product that is more affordable and more sustainable than coffee using modern, cutting edge fermentation technologies.\u201d\n\nPrefer, founded in 2022, makes its bean-free coffee from food byproducts, including soy pulp and broken rice. Berber said it uses ingredients that are \"not pretty enough to go in packaging,\" but contain the qualities and starches needed to create its coffee alternative through the company's fermentation process.\n\nLast February, Prefer raised $2 million in a seed round led by Forge Ventures to fund a manufacturing facility. The company's bean-free coffee is now available at several dozen outlets in Singapore, and is on track to reach 100 locations by the end of the year.\n\nStill, the bean-free alternative isn't a complete replacement and is meant to be used in addition to typical coffee. In order to achieve the same beloved flavor of a morning pour, only up to 40% of Prefer's substitute can be mixed in.\n\nBut those looking for a caffeine fix shouldn\u2019t worry. Prefer is able to make a wide range of caffeinated products, from decaffeinated to double caffeinated.\n\n\u201cCaffeine is just an ingredient for us to be easily sourced from things like green tea, for example,\u201d Berber said, adding that he plans to expand Prefer\u2019s products into other flavors threatened by climate change such as cacao, vanilla, and citrus.\n\nWith more than 2 billion cups consumed daily, coffee is already the world\u2019s most traded agricultural commodity and climate change is expected to push up prices in the long term. Half of the world's coffee farmland could be erased by 2050, and at least 60% of wild coffee species \u2014 including the beloved arabica \u2014 are at risk of going extinct in the wild due to deforestation and disease.\n\nWhile dwindling supply is spurring momentum for coffee alternatives, researchers in the industry say they believe the beloved beverage can be here to stay for a long time, with the right innovation and investment.\n\nWorld Coffee Research is working with coffee growers around the world to breed high quality varieties of coffee that are disease-resistant and productive \u2014 even in the face of often dire climate predictions. In 2024, the group secured a $10 million investment from its global member companies for agricultural R&D to enhance productivity, reduce environmental footprint, and sustain choice for consumers.\n\nHanna Neuschwander, senior advisor of communications at World Coffee Research, said researchers \u201care very optimistic that coffee that comes from a tree will continue to be a viable and important livelihood for many millions of people.\"\n\n\u201cYou have these alternatives arising to solve a problem, but there are many ways to solve a problem,\u201d she added.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStarry is offering its lemon-lime soda on the house when the weather turns scorching this summer as part of its efforts to shore up a positioning around refreshment, according to a press release from the PepsiCo-owned brand.\n\nU.S. consumers can visit a website to add a digital pass to their mobile wallets as part of the \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\" campaign. Once temperatures surpass 100 degrees in their region, the pass triggers automatically, and they can upload a receipt for a 20-ounce Starry purchase to receive 100% cash back via PayPal or Venmo.\n\nThrough July 31, Starry is also deploying out-of-home (OOH) ads and vending machines that dispense Starry around the same temperature threshold in three markets: Miami, Charlotte and Atlanta. The campaign\u2019s concept echoes one from Starry\u2019s chief rival as more beverage brands factor extreme weather into their marketing.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nStarry is promoting itself as a free way to cool down once temperatures tip into the triple digits in the dog days of summer. That could occur more frequently as the effects of climate change produce a greater quantity of longer-lasting heat waves. Many U.S. consumers have already faced a punishing season so far in 2025, and Starry sees its product as a way to deliver \u201cintense refreshment\u201d to soft drink fans who are sweating it out. \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d runs through Sept. 2, while supplies last, and the deal is limited to one offer per customer.\n\nThe brand, which PepsiCo launched two years ago to replace Sierra Mist, joins others in the beverage category in recognizing that intense weather, while alarming, provides opportunities to experiment with contextual and regionally targeted marketing. The OOH component and vending machine activations included in \u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d are largely oriented around the South, including Atlanta, where Starry\u2019s biggest competitor, Sprite, is based.\n\n\u201c100 Degrees, 100% Off\u201d bears similarities to a global campaign that Coca-Cola-owned Sprite debuted in May. \u201cTurn Up Refreshment\u201d features dynamic OOH ad placements that assess factors like location and ambient temperature to serve messages to consumers when temperatures climb to intolerable levels. That effort is focused on international markets, such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Brazil.\n\nFor PepsiCo, the promise of a free Starry could be a way to build awareness and affinity for the two-year-old brand. In addition, Starry is enlisting both national and local influencers to spread the word about the promotion on social channels.\n\nThe campaign arrives as market share for PepsiCo\u2019s flagship soda continues to decline. Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soft drink in the U.S. by volume earlier this year, according to Beverage Digest data. Pepsi last year lost its long-held spot as No. 2 to Dr Pepper.\n\nPepsiCo marketing leadership has seen a shakeup in recent months as well. Mark Kirkham was named CMO of U.S. beverages in April following the departure of Greg Lyons, who held the role since 2018. The beverages division in June also expanded its work with agency VaynerMedia, with the aim of becoming more \u201cculturally fluent\u201d and activating around fast-moving social conversations. Starry is among the five brands in focus for the integrated team.",

This initiative aims to build awareness and affinity for Starry by positioning it around refreshment. The campaign concept echoes a similar effort from Starry's chief rival, Sprite.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis aggressive campaign highlights PepsiCo's urgent efforts to shore up its beverage market position. It comes as PepsiCo's flagship soda has seen significant market share decline, with Sprite surpassing Pepsi to become the No. 3 soft drink by volume. Furthermore, Dr Pepper previously moved past Pepsi to take the No. 2 spot in the U.S. market. The strategic focus on a two-year-old brand with a free product offer suggests PepsiCo is investing heavily to combat competitive pressures.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nKraft Mac & Cheese serves up a slice\n\nCan\u2019t decide between pizza or macaroni and cheese? Now you can have both.\n\nKraft Heinz is serving up a slice of its newest mac and cheese flavor: Pizza. The limited-edition offering, sold at retailers nationwide throughout the back-to-school season, reportedly has savory notes of garlic and classic Italian spices.\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Kraft Heinz is giving consumers in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit \u2014 three of the most iconic pizza places in the U.S. \u2014 the opportunity to get the macaroni and cheese flavor delivered to their doorstep in as little as 15 minutes in a custom Kraft Mac & Cheese pizza delivery box.\n\n\u201cPizza is such an iconic food, and we wanted to create something totally out of the (blue) box to introduce the world to our newest limited-edition flavor,\u201d Cheryl Barbee, communications director for Kraft Mac & Cheese at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement. \u201cFrom the scented delivery box to the rapid delivery timing, red pepper flakes, and even our note to the fans which we designed to look like a \u2018guest check,\u2019 we really lean into the sensorial elements of the pizza delivery experience.\u201d\n\nThe $2.9 billion shelf-stable macaroni and cheese market is ripe for meaningful growth, with a near-term opportunity topping $100 million, Nestl\u00e9 said in 2024. Consumers eat the venerable side dish an average of 22 times a year, the world\u2019s largest food company noted.\n\nFor its part, Kraft Heinz has been launching new limited-time flavors of its popular pasta brand, often to coincide with the season. Earlier this year, it rolled out a smoky barbecue flavor for the summer.\n\nKraft Heinz said previously that nearly half of Americans customize their macaroni and cheese by adding extra seasonings and ingredients, affectionately known as \u201cmac hacks.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Christopher Doering\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of Celestial Seasonings\n\nHain Celestial goes beyond bedtime with new functional teas\n\nHain Celestial is launching a new range of wellness teas designed to support consumers throughout the day \u2013 not just at bedtime.\n\nThe Sleepytime tea owner is expanding its wellness tea portfolio to include a variety of functional beverages that help boost mood, immunity and digestive health, among other attributes.\n\n\"More than ever, health-conscious consumers are looking to their daily cup of tea as part of their overall wellness ritual,\" Lee Nelson, marketing director of Celestial Seasonings, said in a statement. \"We're proud that our Sleepytime teas are part of the nightly routine for so many tea drinkers, and we're eager for these fans to discover the benefits and flavors we've blended in these new offerings that support wellbeing all day long.\"\n\nThe launch features three new teas: Good Vibes Lemon Mint, which is blended with adaptogen ginseng and lemongrass to boost mood; Detox Blend Dandelion, which improves the body's natural detoxification process with green rooibos and aloe vera; and She-Well Raspberry Leaf, containing nettle and chamomile to support women during their monthly cycles.\n\nCelestial is also releasing an Everyday Wellness variety pack featuring four of its functional Sleepytime teas.\n\nAll of the new teas are available at Walmart, with Good Vibes Lemon Mint to remain an exclusive at the retailer. The other teas will arrive at nationwide retailers later this summer.\n\nMore consumers are relying on beverages to support their health, using a variety of drinks to support hydration, energy or mood. Demand for functional drinks has underpinned growth in the beverage industry, with non-alcoholic sales surging 6.2% compared to just 2.4% growth in alcohol, according to Numerator.\n\n\u2014 Sarah Zimmerman\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of General Mills\n\nProgresso kicks off soup season early with new BBQ flavors\n\nIt's the summer of soup at General Mills.\n\nThe company's Progresso brand is firing up the grill for its latest innovation, which is meant to evoke the classic backyard cookout. Progresso Pitmaster is a line of BBQ-inspired soups that include meat, roasted vegetables and high-protein content.\n\n\"We've been focused for some time now on shaking up the soup aisle to deliver new and different choices to appeal to more people,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Carolina Comings, business unit director at General Mills. \u201cWith Progresso Pitmaster, we've packed all the bold, smoky, familiar flavors of a backyard cookout into one easy bowl.\"\n\nEach can contains between 14 and 20 grams of protein. The five flavors are BBQ-Style: Grilled Chicken and Fire Roasted Corn; Hearty Smokehouse-Style: Steak and Potatoes with Roasted Vegetables; Sausage and Beer Cheese with Potatoes; Smokehouse-Style: Grilled Chicken and Potato with Roasted Vegetables; and Steakhouse-Style: Steak & Bean.\n\nSales for soup and other convenient meal options have risen as consumers tighten their budgets and eat more at home. Soup giant Campbell's said consumers are preparing meals at home at the highest level since early 2020 when COVID-19 forced many people to forgo visiting restaurants and other establishments.\n\n\u2014 Sarah Zimmerman",

Hain Celestial expanded its Celestial Seasonings wellness tea line with new functional options for mood, immunity, and digestive health. General Mills' Progresso brand introduced a Pitmaster line of BBQ-inspired, high-protein soups. These launches target convenience, health, and new flavor profiles.\n\n**Why it matters:** These product launches aim to tap into shifting consumer behaviors. The shelf-stable macaroni and cheese market is noted as ripe for meaningful growth, challenging views of it as a stagnant category. Consumers are increasingly seeking beverages for health support, as non-alcoholic functional drink sales outpace alcohol. Additionally, rising sales of convenient meal options like soup indicate consumers are eating more at home due to tightened budgets. This collective shift towards value, health, and at-home consumption could challenge perceptions of declining demand for traditional packaged foods.\n\n**The big picture:** Kraft Heinz has a strategy of introducing new limited-time flavors for its pasta brand, often seasonally, recognizing consumers frequently customize mac and cheese. Hain Celestial is leveraging the trend of health-conscious consumers integrating tea into their daily wellness rituals, expanding its focus beyond traditional bedtime use. General Mills aims to innovate its soup offerings, capitalizing on the broader trend of increased at-home meal preparation driven by consumer budget tightening.

While wellness beverages and mixers often cost more than popular sugary soda brands, consumers seem willing to pay for them.\n\nAccording to Numerator's latest Beverage Behaviors report, spending on drinks is up 4.4%, with non-alcoholic sales surging 6.2%, compared to just 2.4% growth in alcohol.\n\nHydration is the main goal. According to Numerator, 34% of beverage shoppers plan to drink more tap water and 26% more bottled or canned water in the coming year. While wellness mix-ins like probiotic and protein powders are growing, brands like Sonic and Jolly Rancher offer low- or zero-sugar powders simply to make hydration more interesting. Despite economic concerns, retail sales data shows steady growth in the beverage sector, highlighting priority consumer spending.\n\nGen Z is driving demand for flavorful, convenient non-alcoholic drinks that can be consumed on the go or socially, no mix-ins needed. Though drinking less alcohol, their per-drink spending is on par with older generations. The fastest-growing category features a wide flavor range \u2014 from sweet to savory \u2014 and includes energy drinks, soft drinks, bottled water, sports drinks, kombucha, and CBD-infused options. According to Numerator, 85% of the top 20 growing brands fall into these active lifestyle categories.\n\nWithin soft drinks, the low or no sugar flavored soda category in particular has seen significant growth and expansive choices, with brands like Poppi and Health-Ade's SunSip leading the charge. The success of naturally-flavored, low sugar non-alcoholic beverages is pushing brands to align with daily rituals and deliver what the report calls a \u201ccomforting yet exciting hydration experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost consumers just want to drink soda without compromising their health,\u201d says Bridget Firtle, founder of Rockaway Soda, a line of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages sweetened with real juice \u2014 only 7 grams of sugar per serving \u2014 and sea salt, said to boost electrolytes. \u201cTime, research and consumer behavior have shown just how detrimental overly sugary drinks can be for you which is the foundation driving the category.\u201d\n\nWhile celebrities still back alcohol brands, there\u2019s a clear shift toward low-sugar sodas\u2014like Guy Fieri\u2019s collaboration with Waterloo on culinary flavors such as Sparkling Lemon Italian Ice and Spiced Mango Sorbet (yes, the mayor of \u201cFlavor Town\u201d now rules over sparkling water), and Gillian Anderson\u2019s G Spot, a \u201cfunctional\u201d soft drink line made with adaptogens and nootropic cognitive enhancers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created something that celebrates feeling good in your own skin,\u201d says Anderson.

Jolly Rancher sales alone totaled $400 million in 2024, up 25% from the prior year.\n\n\u201cWithin the non-chocolate or sweets business, Jolly Rancher stands apart,\u201d Allen Dark, director of Hershey\u2019s sweets portfolio, said in an interview.\n\nThe 76-year-old Jolly Rancher brand is best known for its bold fruit flavors, such as watermelon and blue raspberry, Hershey said. That's provided more opportunities for the Pennsylvania company to bring the popular flavors into other textures.\n\nHershey devoted more attention to innovating Jolly Rancher starting in 2020 when it relaunched Gummies with new shapes, flavors and packs.\n\nLast year, Hershey launched Jolly Rancher Ropes, which included a chewy outer layer and a soft, fruit-flavored filling. Each rope featured two flavors: green apple and watermelon, or blue raspberry and cherry. And in 2025, Hershey launched Jolly Rancher Freeze Dried, providing consumers with a more poppable offering with a unique, airy texture.\n\nThe wave of innovation has reduced Jolly Rancher\u2019s dependence on its iconic hard candy. While the segment is still growing \u2014 with sales up more than $50 million since the end of 2020 \u2014 less than half of the brand's sales today come from hard candy, down from about 80% a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of permission [from the consumer] with Jolly Rancher to do things in different forms, but maintain our flavors,\u201d Dark said.\n\nDark said Jolly Rancher\u2019s ability to play across multiple sweets categories is \u201cboth freeing and challenging,\" allowing the brand to quickly enter a hot new trend or roll out a seasonal offering. At the same time, it forces executives to \u201cexercise a little bit of restraint because every possible form is available to you,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, Jolly Rancher\u2019s innovation strategy is paying off. Ranked No. 11 among non-chocolate sweets just three years ago, the brand has climbed to the No. 5 spot today, according to Hershey.\n\nAs demand surges, Hershey is holding off on expanding the Jolly Rancher brand into new categories to focus on growing its existing offerings. Ropes have \u201ca long runway ahead of them,\u201d Dark said, while Hershey can \u201cbarely keep up with the demand\u201d for Freeze-Dried.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough to keep us busy,\u201d Dark confessed.",

This strategy has elevated Jolly Rancher to the No. 5 spot in non-chocolate sweets, up from No. 11 three years ago.\n\n**Why it matters:** Jolly Rancher's successful innovation strategy highlights how a legacy brand can achieve significant growth and market share gains by diversifying its product portfolio. This approach has reduced its reliance on a traditional core product, demonstrating effective adaptation to changing consumer preferences. The brand's climb to No. 5 in non-chocolate sweets suggests its focused expansion is creating substantial new revenue streams for Hershey.

The company still expects to deliver 5% to 6% organic revenue growth this year.\n\nMarketing campaigns were cited by executives as contributing to the growth of different brands, including original Coca-Cola, Coca\u2011Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke.\n\nThe beverage maker is navigating a volatile global economy and recently announced plans to use U.S. cane sugar in its signature beverage, a change first announced by President Donald Trump.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Q2 earnings, which beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, demonstrate how the CPG giant is driving growth despite facing different challenges around the globe. The company\u2019s organic growth rate is in line with its guidance for the full year even as volumes soften.\n\n\u201c[While] the external environment continues to be dynamic, and there is no doubt that much uncertainty remains in the downhill, we remain growth-orientated,\u201d said CEO James Quincey on a call discussing the results with investors. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to pivot our plans as needed, and we are harnessing our all-weather strategy to deliver on our growth ambitions.\u201d\n\nPart of that \u201call-weather strategy\u201d rests on marketing, which executives cited as bolstering a number of brands during the quarter. The company used contextually relevant advertising to push messages of value and affordability in Q2, and saw volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke, Fanta, Fairlife, Bodyarmor and Powerade.\n\nA relaunch of the \u201cShare a Coke\u201d campaign was activated on more than 10 billion bottles and cans in more than 120 countries and included over 30,000 names tailored to local markets. The effort contributed to single-serve transaction growth in the category and helped Coca-Cola Zero Sugar see double-digit volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, Diet Coke\u2019s \u201cThis is My Taste\u201d campaign, which was inspired by social media insights, contributed to the product\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth in North America.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s marketing was also a source of productivity-related savings that improved the company\u2019s margins. The marketing transformation that the company has undertaken for the last few years is finding not just effectiveness via digital and segmented advertising, but also efficiencies in advertising production and media buying, Quincey explained.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to need to make investments in different areas of the company to drive future sales, but they also like to get productivity enhancements to offset some of those investments so\u2026 they can grow the top line and improve margins,\u201d said Dave Novosel, senior bond analyst Gimme Credit. \u201cThe fact that they've been able to do both is encouraging\u2026 The advertising productivity is a big part of that.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s marketing transformation has also helped the company quickly test ideas, share learnings and scale campaigns across its portfolio. To that point, the company saw consumer perception improve significantly in Mexico as it launched initiatives like its \u201cJuntos Posen\u201d campaign and an activation around the World Cup. The use of targeted, contextual advertising also helped Coca-Cola push back on claims about how its product is made that have dogged the company in several markets and demographics.\n\nThe company also made official plans to expand its flagship product with an offering made with U.S. cane sugar as a way to offer consumers more choices. The plan was first announced last week by President Trump.\n\n\u201cAs you may have seen last week, we appreciate the President\u2019s enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand,\u201d Quincey said on the earnings call.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nDanone sued competitor Chobani for allegedly copying the slogan and packaging of its cold brew coffee line, calling it the latest \"the latest in a long line of efforts on the part of Chobani to unfairly compete\" with the Paris-based company.\n\nThe suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, claims Chobani's La Colombe cold brew uses \"strikingly similar\" black-and-yellow packaging to Danone's St\u014dk coffee. Chobani's product also allegedly copied Danone's \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan, the suit said.\n\nDanone is requesting a judge to issue an injunction against Chobani to prevent the company from using the slogan. It's also asking for monetary damages, including all of Chobani's profits from selling the products that used the similar packaging.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThis isn't the first time two of the biggest food companies in the U.S. have duked it out in court. Danone has sued Chobani at least two other times in the last 10 years over its advertising claims.\n\nIn 2016, it convinced a U.S. court that Chobani's \"Simply 100\" yogurt falsely implied Danone's Light and Fit contained chlorine. Danone unsuccessfully sued three years later over Chobani's claims that its kids' drinkable yogurt had 33% less sugar.\n\nIn the latest lawsuit, Danone said Chobani's improper use of its intellectual property was \"knowing, calculated, and systematic.\" Danone chose the \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan in January 2021 as a way to distinguish itself from Starbucks and La Colombe, which was an independent company at the time.\n\nAfter Chobani bought La Colombe for $900 million in 2023, Danone claimed it started using a \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan on its coffee packaging. It also changed the product from \"medium roast\" to \"light roast,\" matching Danone's offering, the suit claims.\n\nDanone said Chobani has taken other steps to copy its packaging. Chobani's high-protein Greek yogurt, for example, allegedly uses similar colors, fonts and graphics to Danone's Oikos brand.\n\n\"Chobani's actions enable and have already enabled Chobani to free ride on Danone's reputation,\" Danone said in the suit.\n\nChobani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs food giants combat declining sales, more companies have taken steps to preserve profits by protecting their brand equity. In May, snack maker Mondel\u0113z International sued Aldi to force the grocer to stop using lookalike packaging for a number of private-label snacks such as Oreo and Chips Ahoy!",

Danone claims Chobani's alleged actions allow it to \"free ride on Danone's reputation,\" which could impact brand value and market share. The article suggests this trend of protecting brand equity is increasing as food giants combat declining sales.

Danone specifically adopted the \"Bright & Mellow\" slogan in January 2021 to differentiate its St\u014dk coffee.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUnderstaffing a store isn\u2019t headline-worthy. Yet, at many retailers, such inefficiencies forfeit more inventory than the smash-and-grab robberies that go viral or make the news.\n\nOrganized retail crime continues to hold the attention of policymakers and retail industry groups. But some loss prevention experts say the impact of external theft on inventory loss or shrink is overstated, while the causes of nearly two-thirds of shrink are going largely unappreciated and, therefore, unaddressed.\n\nInventory loss is out of the spotlight to a great extent, in part because many, if not most, retailers that had been complaining about shrink levels have reported improvements. After about 30 years, the National Retail Federation last year said it would no longer report on shrink trends in the industry.\n\nStill, laxity related to labor, pricing, promotions, stock management and other store operations leads to shrink and costs retailers billions, according to a recent study from Coresight Research. The percentage of gross sales lost to in-store inefficiencies stands at 5.5% on average, up from 4.5% last year. Overcoming those inefficiencies could save U.S. retailers in the home improvement, drugstore, grocery, mass merchant and warehouse club sectors as much as $162.7 billion, up 27% since last year, per Coresight.\n\nTackling this requires a hard look at store operations and, for most retailers, a more holistic approach to loss prevention, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I was a bad-guy catcher. I wanted to catch bad guys, I was good at catching bad guys. I loved the adrenaline, I loved the cat and mouse. That\u2019s all I wanted to do,\u201d Johnny Custer, senior director of retail risk solutions at ThinkLP, told sister-publication Retail Dive. \u201cI\u2019ve evolved from that. There are some very progressive retailers where the relationship between operations and LP is seamless, where loss prevention is a specialized extension of the operations team. That\u2019s ultimately where we all need to be. But they are few and far between.\u201d\n\nMargin protection\n\nThat evolution requires retailers to view their loss prevention teams as not just crime fighters but as protectors of profits and margin more broadly.\n\n\u201cLoss prevention is perceived as a cost center. A necessary cost center, a part of doing business,\u201d Custer said by video conference. \u201cMy goal is to change that perspective so that people understand that we're not a cost center, we can actually be a profit driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I was a bad-guy catcher. I wanted to catch bad guys, I was good at catching bad guys. ... I\u2019ve evolved from that.\" Johnny Custer Senior director of retail risk solutions, ThinkLP\n\nErrors in merchandising, pricing and other functions add up quickly, according to Brad Bogolea, CEO and co-founder at Simbe Robotics, which sponsored Coresight\u2019s research.\n\nMore than 80% of the 394 retail business decision-makers that Coresight surveyed said they\u2019re losing at least 5% of their operating margin to in-store inefficiencies; last year just 70% reported that. This year, mistakes related to promotions have been the biggest challenge, with nearly 40% ranking it in their top five, while nearly that many cited pricing errors. Losses from out-of-stocks also stood out, with 57% reporting the issue.\n\n\u201cEven small lapses \u2014 a product on the wrong shelf, an incorrect label \u2014 can cascade into major losses,\u201d Bogolea said. \u201cThese issues erode margins and create friction for shoppers. In contrast, retailers that solve for visibility are seeing a step-change in performance across supply chain, e-commerce fulfillment and store operations.\u201d\n\nUnpacking where margins are being squeezed by operational failures requires data, something Custer learned when he was working in loss prevention for someone who was a data analyst.\n\n\u201cHe expanded my mind and asked me to look into point-of-sale. And then, not only point-of-sale, but center of store, all of the sales-floor data, then the back of the store \u2014 all the inbound, outbound flow data,\u201d he said. \u201cTo look for similar patterns of behavior that occur within each, because loss can happen anywhere in the building. I did it reluctantly, but I became a believer the moment the financial results came out.\u201d\n\nTech to the rescue\n\nGetting that data \u2014 and the visibility into store operations that it provides \u2014 is enabled by technologies that find mistakes, flag needs and detect patterns.\n\nRetailers are increasingly turning to them. In the U.S., retailers\u2019 plans for investment in store intelligence technologies for the next year have skyrocketed over 150%, Coresight found. More than a third of retailers say they\u2019ll be investing at least $500,000 in that time; on average, each company is dedicating more than $415,000.\n\nSome 60% of retailers have turned to AI to assist in loss prevention, with another 30% planning to do so in the next year, according to a February study from vision AI firm Everseen.\n\n\u201cEven small lapses \u2014 a product on the wrong shelf, an incorrect label \u2014 can cascade into major losses.\" Brad Bogolea CEO and co-founder, Simbe Robotics\n\nTech is helping break down the divisions between the loss prevention and operating teams, according to loss prevention consultant Brand Elverston, who works with major retailers and brands.\n\n\u201cThe silos of risk mitigation, store operations and supply chain are all but going, and that's been fueled largely by countless use cases of technologies that are out in the space today,\u201d he said. \u201cI can do your in-stock. I can tell you if it came in off the truck. I can tell you how many people are in the store. I can tell you, if somebody stole something, what door they went out of.\u201d\n\nSome tech designed to detect crime or criminal intent has gained broader uses, as at Verensics, an employee questionnaire-based platform. Some retailer clients are now sharing information gleaned from employee questionnaires so that teams in store ops, human resources, loss prevention and elsewhere can connect various dots, according to Verensics CEO-founder Russ Law. Similarly, ThinkLP platforms leverage point-of-sales data, human resources data, inventory data and more.\n\n\u201cThe data is geared towards crime, obviously, but it's being used more and more for operational integrity issues,\u201d Verensics\u2019 Law said by video conference. \u201cMaybe the inventory isn't being done right because nobody knows exactly what they're supposed to be doing. Or maybe there's a manager who's not getting the point across the way they're supposed to. It\u2019s identifying places where there are training opportunities, or where there are opportunities to tighten up processes, as well as identifying bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe human touch\n\nAs much as technology has revolutionized store operations, though, retailers risk undermining their systems if stores are inadequately staffed.\n\nStore-level thefts, always a problem in retail, got a boost around the time of the Great Recession. ThinkLP\u2019s Custer attributes that to job cuts, especially around 2008 or so, that went too far and haven\u2019t been restored in the years since.\n\n\u201cThe worse the backroom looks, the higher the shrink. It's just the way it is. If you're not managing inventory, you've increased your risk of shrink.\u201d Brand Elverston Loss prevention specialist, Elverston Consulting\n\n\u201cRetailers cut a lot of non-essential personnel, and one of the first groups of people they cut were the perpetual inventory, day-to-day count keepers, the folks that scan the store and keep count,\u201d Custer said. \u201cThat has had a ripple effect across so many profitability areas \u2014 from clearance markdowns to in-stock position to day-to-day customer service. I can point to that one mistake and say that if that wouldn\u2019t have happened, we\u2019d be in a much different situation right now.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, retailers eliminated many of the non-essential employees who weren\u2019t coming into work, and shrink ballooned, according to Elverston.\n\n\u201cThe worse the backroom looks, the higher the shrink. It's just the way it is,\u201d he said by video conference. \u201cIf you\u2019re not managing inventory, you\u2019ve increased your risk of shrink.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Retailers Losing Billions from Inefficiencies, Not Just External Theft\n\n**Key details:** A new Coresight Research study reveals that in-store operational inefficiencies are a larger driver of retail inventory loss than external theft. The percentage of gross sales lost to these internal inefficiencies now stands at 5.5% on average, an increase from 4.5% last year. These issues include errors in merchandising, pricing, promotions, and out-of-stocks. Overcoming these operational failures could save U.S. retailers in specific sectors as much as $162.7 billion. More than 80% of retail business decision-makers surveyed reported losing at least 5% of their operating margin to these issues.\n\n**Why it matters:** This information challenges the prevailing industry consensus that organized retail crime is the primary cause of retail \"shrink.\" Loss prevention experts suggest that the impact of external theft is overstated, with internal inefficiencies causing nearly two-thirds of shrink. By addressing these unappreciated operational causes, retailers can view loss prevention teams not just as cost centers but as significant profit drivers. This shift in focus could lead to substantial margin improvements across the retail sector.\n\n**The big picture:** Inventory loss has largely been out of the spotlight, with many retailers previously reporting improvements in shrink levels. The National Retail Federation even stopped reporting on industry shrink trends last year. However, laxity related to labor, pricing, promotions, and stock management continues to lead to significant losses. Experts note that historical job cuts, particularly affecting inventory management roles around the Great Recession and COVID-19 pandemic, have contributed to increased shrink.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **5.5%:** Average percentage of gross sales lost to in-store inefficiencies, up from 4.5% last year.\n*   **$162.7 billion:** Potential savings for U.S. retailers by overcoming these inefficiencies, a 27% increase year-over-year.\n*   **>80%:** Proportion of surveyed retail decision-makers losing at least 5% of operating margin to in-store inefficiencies this year, up from 70% last year.\n*   **57%:** Proportion of retailers reporting out-of-stocks as an issue.\n*   **>150%:** Increase in U.S. retailers\u2019 plans for investment in store intelligence technologies for the next year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Coresight Research:** Conducted a recent study on retail inefficiencies, highlighting billions in losses from store operations.\n*   **Johnny Custer:** Senior director at ThinkLP, advocates for loss prevention teams to act as profit protectors, not just crime fighters.\n*   **ThinkLP:** Provides platforms leveraging various data, including point-of-sale and HR, for operational integrity issues.\n*   **Brad Bogolea:** CEO and co-founder of Simbe Robotics, which sponsored Coresight's research, noted how small lapses cascade into major losses.\n*   **Simbe Robotics:** Sponsored the Coresight Research study, emphasizing technology's role in improving store visibility and performance.\n*   **Everseen:** Vision AI firm that published a study on AI adoption for loss prevention among retailers.\n*   **Brand Elverston:** Loss prevention consultant who works with major retailers, observing technology breaking down departmental silos.\n*   **Russ Law:** CEO and founder of Verensics, stated their employee questionnaire platform is used for operational integrity issues.\n*   **Verensics:** An employee questionnaire-based platform, its data helps identify training opportunities and tighten processes.\n*   **National Retail Federation (NRF):** Industry group that stopped reporting on industry shrink trends last year after approximately 30 years.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Retailers face massive, overlooked losses from internal inefficiencies, driving tech investment for profit protection.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Friday Checkout is a weekly column providing more insight on the news, rounding up the announcements you may have missed and sharing what\u2019s to come.\n\nDistribution has been a hot-button issue for the grocery industry this year, with United Natural Foods, Inc.\u2019s cybersecurity attack taking center stage along with C&S Wholesale Grocers\u2019 recent bid to acquire SpartanNash.\n\nWith all eyes on the food supply chain, grocers\u2019 efforts to build out self-distribution networks couldn\u2019t be more timely.\n\nSelf-distribution was a major talking point during Sprouts Farmers Market\u2019s second quarter earnings call earlier this week. Though UNFI\u2019s near shutdown was \u201cminimally disruptive\u201d to the fast-growing specialty grocer, according to CEO Jack Sinclair, its expanding self-distribution network is looking more and more appealing these days. It will enable the specialty grocer to have \u201cmore control over [its] supply chain while minimizing operations and supply chain risks,\u201d Sinclair told investors.\n\nSprouts runs a network of distribution centers across its operating footprint, with around 80% of its stores located within 250 miles of one. The grocer has a new DC set to open in Northern California next year. It\u2019s also bringing its fresh meat and seafood sourcing in-house, according to an April investor presentation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a transition period,\u201d Sinclair said about the ongoing efforts to establish a more self-sufficient supply chain. He added that Sprouts will continue to take over distribution of \u201ckey product categories.\u201d\n\nSprouts is far from the first food retailer to turn to self-distribution. Ahold Delhaize US, for example, has ADUSA Distribution as well as ADUSA Transportation to serve all of its stateside banners. This self-distribution push began in 2019 and, as of 2023, included around two dozen facilities along the East Coast.\n\nWalmart is also part of this trend. This year alone, the retailer opened its first owned-and-operated case-ready beef facility, purchased a distribution center in Utah and debuted a Sam\u2019s Club distribution center in Florida.\n\nSelf-distribution is difficult to carry out for smaller, independent grocers that lack the resources to build and operate supply facilities. But for larger retailers, it can help save money and avoid catastrophe if third-party distributors can\u2019t deliver.\n\nThe outside of an Ahold Delhaize USA distribution center in Chester, New York.

The page provides individual food definitions for states that have received waivers as well as state communication strategies, implementation timelines and a state-by-state comparison showing how \u201ccandy\u201d is defined. The trade group said it will keep the resource updated as information becomes available.\n\nDoorDash bolsters its grocery presence\n\nThe e-commerce provider announced Tuesday the addition of six retailers to its platform. The newcomers include Bi-Rite Market and Lunardi\u2019s Markets in the San Francisco Bay Area, Superior Grocers in California and three grocers in Ohio: Dave\u2019s Markets, Dorothy Lane Market and Lucky\u2019s Markets.\n\nWhole Foods takes on \u201cbiodiversity highway initiative\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Whole Foods Market unveiled a partnership with Mad Agriculture to launch a national initiative aimed at reconstructing native ecosystems across farmland in the U.S. The program, which will begin in and around the Lowery Creek Watershed in Wisconsin, aims to buffer communities from flooding and erosion, improve soil and water health, and support pollinators and wildlife.\n\nWhole Foods said the creation of a 1,000-acre \u201cbiodiversity highway\u201d will address issues such as disappearing biodiversity, declining soil health and weakening ability of land to withstand environmental stress. As part of the initiative, the Amazon-owned grocer has pledged up to $500,000 in matching funds to \u201ccatalyze $1 million in collective investment from food system stakeholders in 2025.\u201d\n\nImpulse find\n\nStop & Shop makes a \u2018Happy\u2019 cameo\n\nNetflix\u2019s hit movie \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u201d features a laundry list of star cameos, including Ben Stiller, rapper Eminem, NFL player Travis Kelce and pro golfers Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s our personal favorite: Stop & Shop.\n\nThe Northeast grocery chain\u2019s Clifton, New Jersey, store plays a key role early on in the film.

Similar to recent years, Sprouts aims to open 35 new locations by the end of this year \u2014 a goal it is on track to achieve, according to Sinclair. During Q2, the specialty grocer opened a dozen new locations.\n\nIn addition to store growth in 2025, Sprouts is also readying a larger expansion effort in the coming years. Currently, the grocer has more than 130 approved locations in the pipeline \u2014 up from nearly 120 last quarter \u2014 mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nTo better support its growing footprint, Sprouts is continuing to invest in self-distribution, which Sinclair said is a \u201cstrategic priority, enabling scalable growth in the future.\u201d This work has included expanding supply chain capacity in existing markets as well as building new capacity in Sprouts\u2019 expansion markets. Sprouts aims to place stores within 250 miles of a distribution center, Sinclair said.\n\nThe company is also working to take over distribution of \u201ckey product categories,\u201d specifically meat and seafood. Sinclair said that Sprouts will begin in-sourcing fresh meat and seafood this quarter in Orlando, Florida, and continue the work through the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. In the next three to five years, Sprouts will also focus on new distribution center expansion, he said.\n\nSprouts is also growing its private label assortment, with the grocer planning to release over 350 new products in 2025. Sprouts\u2019 store brand contributed to 24% of total sales in Q2, the grocer\u2019s CFO Curtis Valentine said during the investor call.\n\nSprouts sees slight dip in comp sales after six consecutive quarters of growth Sprouts\u2019 quarterly comparative store sales growth.\n\nFor its second quarter, Sprouts reported a net sales year-over-year increase of 17%, totaling $2.2 billion, and a 10.2% increase in comparable-store sales. While these results still signify growth across nearly all aspects of Sprouts\u2019 operations, the grocer\u2019s same-store sales growth dipped slightly from the 11.7% growth it posted in the metric in Q1, marking its first quarterly dip in more than a year.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Sprouts Rolls Out Loyalty Program, Expands Amid Growth Initiatives.\n\n**Key details:**\nSprouts Farmers Market officially launched its loyalty program across its Arizona stores and initial pilot locations, totaling approximately 75 sites. CEO Jack Sinclair anticipates the program will be chainwide by the end of October, aiming for \"big benefits\" next year. The company is also expanding its store footprint, with 35 new locations targeted for this year, and has over 130 approved locations in its pipeline, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest. Additionally, Sprouts is investing in self-distribution and increasing its private label selection, with plans for over 350 new products in 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe loyalty program is expected to provide valuable data to improve merchandising, communication, and future store placement. These growth initiatives, including store expansion and self-distribution, are strategic priorities designed to enable scalable growth for Sprouts. This focus on long-term expansion and operational efficiency comes as the company experienced a slight dip in comparable-store sales growth in Q2, marking its first such dip after six consecutive quarters of growth. These efforts suggest a proactive strategy to re-accelerate growth and solidify its market position, potentially challenging a consensus view of sustained, uninterrupted comparable sales increases.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSprouts Farmers Market, a specialty grocer, is pursuing multiple growth avenues. This includes the widespread implementation of a new loyalty program, continued expansion of its store footprint, and significant investments in its supply chain for increased self-sufficiency. The company is also growing its private label offerings, which contributed significantly to its sales. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to support future growth and market penetration, particularly in new regions like the Northeast and Midwest.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Loyalty program live at approximately 75 locations.\n*   Sprouts aims to open 35 new locations by the end of this year.\n*   More than 130 approved locations in pipeline (up from nearly 120 last quarter).\n*   Private label contributed 24% of total sales in Q2.\n*   Sprouts reported net sales of $2.2 billion in Q2, a 17% year-over-year increase.\n*   Comparable-store sales increased by 10.2% in Q2, down from 11.7% in Q1.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Sprouts Farmers Market:** The grocery company implementing a new loyalty program and various growth initiatives.\n*   **Jack Sinclair:** CEO of Sprouts, provided updates on the loyalty program, store expansion, and supply chain.\n*   **Curtis Valentine:** CFO of Sprouts, stated private label products contributed to Q2 sales.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Sprouts aims to have its loyalty program available chainwide by the end of October.\n*   The company will begin in-sourcing fresh meat and seafood this quarter in Orlando, Florida.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nSprouts invests in long-term growth following a recent comparable sales dip.",

Walmart said at the time it would appeal that verdict, but this week\u2019s settlement rules out that option.\n\nJudge James M.

While at the pet supply company, he led its distribution and transportation strategy across North America and oversaw an international distribution network.\n\nOldham brings more than 25 years of experience in retail, CPGs and consulting to Kroger, including leadership roles at Petco, Walmart, Ernst & Young and Walgreens.\n\n\u201cEd brings a wealth of knowledge from his time working at and supporting a variety of different retailers,\u201d Ron Sargent, chairman and interim CEO of Kroger, said in a statement. \u201cSourcing plays a critical role in making sure we can provide lower prices to our customers every day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Reed will bring \u201cdeep experience across our organization\u201d to her upcoming role overseeing the grocer\u2019s private brands portfolio, Sargent said. Reed started at Kroger as a co-manager in the Central Division in 1993 and worked her way up the company, holding positions such as store manager, category manager, director of deli and bakery, and director of Fresh Ready Meals, according to the announcement.\n\nReed became vice president of merchandising at Fry\u2019s in 2010, followed by VP of merchandising at Fred Meyer in 2013 and then VP of Customer 1st Promise in 2015.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nKroger\u2019s data arm 84.51\u00b0 announced Wednesday the unification of its retail media, consumer insights and loyalty marketing services.\n\nThose teams are now aligned in a single division under Kroger Precision Marketing, the grocer\u2019s retail media business.\n\nKroger said the change will help fuel full-funnel brand growth and build integrated commercial services at 84.51\u00b0.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nKroger said it\u2019s establishing the division in response to brands that are demanding \u201cfaster insights, flexible media capabilities, and broader growth strategies enabled with data science.\u201d\n\nThe newly unified Kroger Precision Marketing will offer brands promotion, assortment planning, media activation and optimization services through one team. Kroger noted that it aims to provide a unified offering across media, insights and incentives.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a new organizational design,\u201d Milen Mahadevan, president and CEO of 84.51\u00b0, said in the announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re eliminating the friction between functions.\u201d\n\nChristine Foster, senior vice president of strategy and operations, will help lead Kroger Precision Marketing, while Nick Hamilton, senior vice president of commercial technology, will oversee technology innovation. Kroger promoted Jenny Holleran and Sam Walston to vice presidents of commercial sales where they will lead integrated client teams organized by industry verticals.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s marketers are held accountable for more than media performance\u2014they\u2019re responsible for brand growth,\u201d Foster said in the announcement. \u201cThis new structure is designed for exactly that. Our team helps brands translate precision purchase data into actions across every part of their organization.\u201d\n\nThe unification of Kroger\u2019s retail media, consumer insights and loyalty marketing services follows the grocery company\u2019s creation of a new e-commerce business unit earlier this year. In March, Kroger promoted Yael Cosset to executive vice president and chief digital officer to lead the division. It comes at a time when the grocer is pushing to make e-commerce profitable. Kroger recorded $13 billion in e-commerce sales in fiscal 2024, with its digital sales up 15% year over year during its latest quarter.\n\nKroger recently announced plans to close 60 stores as it looks to tighten its belt after its proposed merger with Albertsons fell through. During its earnings call last month, Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Kroger is \u201caggressively looking for ways to reduce costs throughout the company.\u201d\n\nKroger\u2019s efforts to strengthen and streamline its marketing services come as retailers increasingly tap into retail media as an alternative revenue generator. Walmart\u2019s advertising business Walmart Connect grew 31% year over year in the U.S. during its most recent quarter.\n\nWhile Kroger has seen a rollback in CPG spending recently, the grocer\u2019s retail media business \u201ccontinues to grow at a healthy rate\u201d and is expected to continue that trajectory for the rest of the year, CFO David Kennerly told investors in June.\n\nAt the end of 2024, retail media networks were valued at $8.5 billion for U.S. grocers, with the number of retail media networks predicted to double over the following 18 months, according to a report by Grocery Doppio, a news and insights firm run by digital services company Incisiv.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Kroger Streamlines Ad Business, Eyes Brand Growth Amid Cost Cuts\n\n**Key details:**\nKroger\u2019s data arm 84.51\u00b0 announced the unification of its retail media, consumer insights, and loyalty marketing services. These teams are now aligned in a single division under Kroger Precision Marketing, the grocer\u2019s retail media business. Kroger stated this change will help fuel full-funnel brand growth and build integrated commercial services. The company is responding to brands\u2019 demands for faster insights, flexible media, and broader growth strategies. The unified unit will offer promotion, assortment planning, media activation, and optimization services through one team.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis move is designed to provide a unified offering across media, insights, and incentives, eliminating friction between functions. It aims to help brands translate precision purchase data into actions for overall brand growth. While Kroger has recently seen a rollback in CPG spending, its retail media business \"continues to grow at a healthy rate.\" This initiative indicates Kroger is actively developing alternative revenue streams, potentially challenging a consensus view that focuses solely on CPG spending headwinds or challenges from the failed Albertsons merger. The company expects this growth trajectory to continue for the rest of the year, providing a bright spot amidst broader cost-cutting efforts.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe unification of services follows Kroger\u2019s creation of a new e-commerce business unit earlier this year, which the grocer is pushing to make profitable. Kroger recently announced plans to close 60 stores and is aggressively looking for ways to reduce costs after its proposed merger with Albertsons fell through. These efforts to strengthen marketing services come as retailers increasingly tap into retail media as an alternative revenue generator.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Kroger recorded $13 billion in e-commerce sales in fiscal 2024.\n*   Kroger\u2019s digital sales were up 15% year over year during its latest quarter.\n*   Kroger recently announced plans to close 60 stores.\n*   Walmart\u2019s advertising business Walmart Connect grew 31% year over year in the U.S. during its most recent quarter.\n*   Retail media networks were valued at $8.5 billion for U.S. grocers at the end of 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Kroger:** Grocer streamlining marketing services and aggressively cutting costs.\n*   **84.51\u00b0:** Kroger\u2019s data arm that unified retail media, consumer insights, and loyalty marketing.\n*   **Kroger Precision Marketing:** The grocer\u2019s new unified division for retail media.\n*   **Milen Mahadevan:** President and CEO of 84.51\u00b0, stated the new design eliminates friction.\n*   **Albertsons:** Proposed merger with Kroger fell through, impacting Kroger\u2019s cost strategy.\n*   **David Kennerly:** Kroger CFO, stated retail media business continues healthy growth.\n*   **Walmart:** Competitor whose advertising business grew 31% year over year.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nKroger streamlines ad business for growth, offsetting CPG spending slowdown.",

That comes on top of providers\u2019 hefty burden of administrative work and other tasks in electronic health records, which clinicians say requires them to work overtime and contributes to burnout.\n\nTo help automate some of this work, the HTI-4 rule adds and updates criteria for software to receive certification by regulators. The Health IT Certification Program is a voluntary program that outlines standards and functionality for health IT, like EHRs.\n\nOn prior authorization, the regulation adopts three new criteria: one that allows providers to request information from payers about coverage requirements, another that offers a method for clinicians and other EHR users to quickly collect the data needed for a prior authorization request, and a third that allows providers to submit requests through their IT systems and check the request\u2019s status.\n\nThe final prior authorization criteria are a little different than originally proposed, said Alex Baker, deputy director of the alignment and engagement division of the office of policy at ASTP.\n\nThe proposed regulation, first announced last year, had only included one criterion that included all of the capabilities. But regulators broke them into three to provide more flexibility, allowing IT companies to certify products based on just one functionality instead, he said.\n\nHTI-4 also adds new criteria for functionality for application programming interfaces, or APIs, linked to the prior authorization standard, including allowing workflow triggers in an EHR for clinical decision support tools. Another criteria allows users to be notified by a server of an event, like an update on a prior authorization request.\n\nOutside of prior authorization, the rule adopts a new criterion for real-time prescription benefit information, so providers and patients can easily compare drug prices, see out-of-pocket costs and check prior authorization requirements.\n\nAdditionally, HTI-4 updates criteria for electronic prescribing, which enables prescription data to be shared between providers, pharmacies and payers.\n\nThe rule is part of a series of interoperability regulations released over the past couple years. HTI-4 includes some provisions from the HTI-2 proposed rule, which was first released in July last year.\n\nOther parts of the initial HTI-2 proposal were finalized in other regulations, including one published in December that focused on the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, or TEFCA, and another on an information blocking exception that aimed to preserve access to reproductive healthcare.\n\nThe HTI-1 regulation, finalized in December 2023, is a sweeping rule that included transparency requirements for artificial intelligence in certified health software.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe CMS on Thursday finalized a 2.6% payment increase for inpatient hospitals in 2026, higher than what regulators originally proposed earlier this year.\n\nHospital payments will now rise by about $5 billion in 2026 \u2014 $1 billion more than what was originally proposed under a 2.4% payment increase in April.\n\nMedicare also finalized changes to quality reporting, including removing COVID-19 vaccination requirements for healthcare workers and a mandatory payment model starting in January.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe inpatient pay raise reflects a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment, according to a CMS fact sheet on the final rule.\n\nThe rule also includes higher payments to disproportionate share hospitals for uncompensated care in Medicare. Disproportionate share hospitals will now receive approximately $2 billion more in uncompensated care payments, higher than the $1.5 billion increase originally proposed.\n\nHospital groups said they appreciated the pay bump, but still considered it inadequate. Hospitals have raised concerns about their pay alongside rising inflation and looming healthcare policies finalized in the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d that will cut funds to hospitals and raise the uninsured rate.\n\n\u201cThe AHA is also pleased that CMS\u2019 payment updates and support for hospitals that treat a disproportionately high number of low-income patients are improved in this final rule,\u201d said Ashley Thompson, senior vice president of public policy analysis and development at the American Hospital Association, in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are still concerned that these updates are not adequate enough for the many hospitals that are struggling in today\u2019s challenging operating environment, especially those in rural and underserved communities.\u201d\n\nOther finalized changes include the removal of some measures included in inpatient quality reporting requirements. Hospitals report certain quality metrics as a condition of their inpatient payment rate from Medicare, and those that don\u2019t report quality data or don\u2019t meet all program requirements can have their annual inpatient payments reduced by 25%.\n\nNext year, hospitals won\u2019t be required to report metrics on COVID vaccination among healthcare workers, a health equity metric and some screenings related to social determinants of health. The Trump administration has targeted mandatory COVID vaccination policies, including those in public schools and the federal agency that reviews the vaccines.\n\nThe CMS is also tweaking a mandatory payment model debuting next year, called Transforming Episode Accountability Model. The five-year alternative payment model aims to hold hospitals accountable for care quality for patients undergoing surgeries in traditional Medicare. In TEAM, select acute care hospitals in certain geographic areas will assume responsibility for the cost and quality of care from surgery through the 30 days after the Medicare enrollee leaves the hospital.\n\nThe final rule includes minor changes to TEAM, including broadening certain waivers for skilled nursing facilities and using patient-reported outcomes in outpatient settings.\n\nHospitals have pushed back on the mandatory payment model, which they say could burden low-resource hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe AHA has long supported widespread adoption of meaningful, value-based and alternative payment models to deliver high-quality care at lower costs. We remain worried that the Transforming Episode Accountability Model (TEAM) will not advance these objectives and puts at particular risk hospitals that are not of a large enough size or in a position to support the investments needed,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis is why we continue to urge the agency to make TEAM voluntary.\u201d\n\nThe CMS also said it will discontinue a low wage index hospital policy for 2026 and all subsequent years, after an appellate court found the CMS lacked statutory authority to adopt the policy. The low wage index policy, first adopted in the CMS\u2019 final rule for 2020, proposed to temporarily adjust reimbursement rates according to a wage index that would compare regional average wages to national averages. The policy, which was meant to last four years, was aimed to mitigate growing wage disparities between hospitals, but a D.C. circuit court overruled the policy in July 2024.\n\nIn addition to discontinuing the policy, the rule also finalized a \u201cnarrow,\u201d budget-neutral transitional payment exception to the calculation of 2026 inpatient rates for hospitals significantly impacted by the discontinuation.",

The pilot is a significant departure from the traditional 340B model, which gives hospitals upfront discounts for certain medications. Under the pilot, hospitals would receive rebates coordinated by drug manufacturers, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. To receive reimbursement, providers will submit data to manufacturers within 45 calendar days of dispensing the drug, allowing for some extenuating circumstances, and then receive a rebate within 10 days.\n\nrebates coordinated by drug manufacturers, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. To receive reimbursement, providers will submit data to manufacturers within 45 calendar days of dispensing the drug, allowing for some extenuating circumstances, and then receive a rebate within 10 days. The American Hospital Association immediately criticized the program on Thursday, warning diverting from the decades-old 340B program sets a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for the future.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe 340B Drug Pricing Program was created more than three decades ago to support hospitals with a large number of low-income patients by requiring drugmakers to offer those providers steep discounts on outpatient drugs \u2014 often about 20% to 50% off the list price of a drug. Since its conception, the program has grown greatly to over 55,000 covered entities in 2021.\n\nThe program has proved a flash point between drugmakers and providers, as pharmaceutical companies say the rebates, which cover billions of dollars worth of drugs each year, cut into their bottom lines. Some also argue hospitals are cheating the program.\n\nDrugmakers say hospitals have diverted drugs to ineligible patients or, in some cases, received duplicative discounts for the same medications. Hospitals, however, say the 340B rebates are a needed lifeline for hospitals with low operating margins.\n\nResearch is mixed about the efficacy of the program. Some studies have found the program works as intended, allowing hospitals to expand services for low-income patients and subsidize uncompensated care. However, other studies find hospitals are not complying with basic tenets of 340B, including not reselling discounted medications.\n\nDrugmakers have been pushing for a 340B rebate model to tamp down on what they say is waste, fraud and abuse in the program. Last year, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis sued the federal government to allow them to issue rebates for 340B drugs instead of upfront discounts.\n\nHowever, a court shut down those plans earlier this year, ruling that HRSA would have to sign off on such a rebate plan. While the Biden administration sought to uphold the traditional 340B model, the Trump administration has signaled an interest in adding additional oversight to the program, including potentially putting CMS in charge of overseeing rebates.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is introducing a pilot program that, in a limited capacity, offers a chance to test a rebate system.\n\nThe pilot, which will be limited to the 10 drug products included on the CMS Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Selected Drug List, is accepting applications from drug manufacturers until Sept. 15, with a start date of Jan. 1.\n\nThe program aims to address \u201cconcerns we have received from both covered entities and manufacturers, while creating a measured approach to the process of approving manufacturer rebate models under the 340B Program,\u201d said HRSA Administrator Tom Engels in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe look forward to receiving comments and working with everyone to ensure that the program operates with accountability, transparency and adherence to the 340B statute, allowing covered entities to stretch scarce resources as far as possible.\u201d\n\nHospital groups immediately reacted negatively to the pilot.\n\n340B Health, an association of more than 1,600 hospitals, said that shifting to a post-purchase model would force some hospitals to pay an average of more than $72 million upfront, potentially straining their ability to provide patient care service. The group said in a statement Thursday that it worried about the administrative and financial cost of the program \u2014 particularly if the Trump administration chooses to expand the pilot beyond the initial 10 drugs.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that this guidance authorizes a significant departure from how the 340B program has successfully operated for decades and sets a dangerous precedent for possible harmful expansions in the future,\u201d said Aimee Kuhlman, vice president of advocacy grassroots and government relations at the American Hospital Association, echoing 340B Health\u2019s sentiments.\n\nHowever, the AHA said it appreciated HRSA\u2019s efforts to \u201cimpose strict guardrails on its limited pilot program.\u201d\n\nFor example, manufacturers will be in charge of handling all IT costs related to submitting drug purchasing data. The notice also requires \u201cno additional administrative costs of running the rebate model shall be passed onto the covered entities.\u201d\n\nIn addition, HRSA mandates manufacturers cannot deny a rebate based on concerns of diversion or duplicate discounts.",

Executives have said accepting health plan coverage for mental healthcare is key to increasing affordability and pushing potential consumers to enroll.\n\nThe business has also seen increased churn in self-paying users this year, linked to softening consumer sentiment amid macroeconomic uncertainty, CFO Mala Murthy said on Teladoc\u2019s Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is actually being driven by more consumers using insurance for their mental health needs, for mental health therapy, and an increase in advertising by other virtual mental health companies that offer insurance coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nTeladoc has made some progress on accepting insurance coverage for BetterHelp. This spring, the telehealth firm acquired UpLift, another virtual mental health company, which already worked with payers like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Cigna.\n\nAnd in late June, Teladoc began a \u201csoft launch\u201d of BetterHelp insurance in one state, which would lay the groundwork for expansion over the next several quarters, CEO Chuck Divita said on the earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to build that network out beyond the single state, so that as we ramp further, we\u2019ll be able to turn on multiple markets over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do want to take it methodically here at the start to make sure all the capabilities that we build are working.\u201d\n\nThe move to accept insurance shows progress on Teladoc\u2019s strategic changes, but \u201cthe full impact of these repositioning efforts is going to take some time to play out, and comes against a more challenging macro backdrop,\u201d Cherny wrote.\n\nIn Teladoc\u2019s integrated care unit, which includes business-to-business virtual care offerings, revenue revenue rose 4% to $391.5 million in the second quarter, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 10% to $57.5 million.\n\nThe unit\u2019s overall membership increased 11% compared with the previous year to 102.4 million members.

Major payers like Elevance, Molina and UnitedHealth have cut their earnings guidance as they face high medical costs, particularly in Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and Medicare plans.\n\nHeightened medical expenses also hit CVS hard last year, as seniors in Medicare Advantage sought out more care and Medicaid beneficiaries remaining in the program after redeterminations were sicker and required more services.\n\nAdditionally, this spring CVS announced plans to exit the ACA marketplace entirely for 2026, after CEO David Joyner said the company saw no \u201cnear- or long-term pathway\u201d for Aetna to improve its performance on the exchanges.\n\nBut the company\u2019s health benefits unit began to turn around last quarter \u2014 and the improved performance has held in the second quarter, according to results released Thursday.\n\nCVS recorded $36.3 billion in revenue in its health benefits unit, increasing nearly 12% from the $32.5 billion reported in 2024.\n\nAdjusted operating income rose to $1.3 billion due to favorable risk adjustment changes in the exchanges, as well as improved performance in government insurance programs, CVS said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to report that we are making meaningful progress in the Aetna business. Our recovery has been a top priority,\u201d Joyner said on the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the results of these efforts delivering better experiences while also allowing us to better navigate this elevated utilization environment.\u201d\n\nStill, the company recorded a premium deficiency reserve \u2014 how much an insurer expects they might need if premiums collected aren\u2019t sufficient to meet future claims expenses \u2014 of $471 million in the second quarter, linked to high costs in CVS\u2019 group MA plans.\n\nGroup MA plans are multi-year agreements, so CVS can update prices on them less frequently, CFO Brian Newman said. However, about half of CVS\u2019 group MA plans are set to be repriced next year, he added.\n\nOverall, the health benefits segment recorded a medical loss ratio, a marker of spending on patient care, of 89.9%, up slightly from 89.6% last year.\n\nIn CVS\u2019 health services unit, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark as well as its healthcare delivery assets, revenue increased about 10% to $46.5 billion.\n\nBut adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, down nearly 18% year over year, in part due to a high medical loss ratio at the company\u2019s value-based primary care chain Oak Street Health.\n\n\u201cWe saw some pressure inside of our healthcare delivery business that was driven by persistent elevated medical cost, the member mix that we had and then the more robust benefit and supplemental benefit offerings that plans provided to their members,\u201d said Prem Shah, group president at CVS, whose oversight includes its care delivery business.\n\nHowever, the medical cost pressure at Oak Street and the company\u2019s premium deficiency reserve weren\u2019t a complete surprise, \u201cgiven results from others across the managed care complex,\u201d Michael Cherny, an analyst at Leerink Partners, wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nOverall, CVS beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and revenue in the second quarter.

Despite these broader industry and past company challenges, CVS's health benefits unit recently began to turn around, with recovery being a top priority.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Adjusted earnings per share outlook: $6.30 to $6.40 (up from $6.00 to $6.20).\n*   Health benefits segment adjusted operating income: Rose more than 39% year over year in Q2.\n*   Health benefits unit revenue: $36.3 billion, increasing nearly 12% from $32.5 billion.\n*   Overall Q2 revenue: $98.9 billion, a more than 8% year over year increase.\n*   Premium deficiency reserve: $471 million in Q2, linked to high costs in group MA plans.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CVS Health:** Healthcare giant that raised its adjusted earnings outlook due to improved unit performance.\n*   **Aetna:** CVS's insurer unit, whose improved financial performance significantly contributed to the raised outlook.\n*   **Steve Nelson:** Aetna President, who expressed encouragement about the quarter's positive playing out.\n*   **David Joyner:** Aetna CEO, pleased with meaningful progress and recovery efforts in the Aetna business.\n*   **Elevance, Molina, UnitedHealth:** Major payers mentioned as having cut earnings guidance due to high medical costs.\n*   **Oak Street Health:** CVS's value-based primary care chain, facing pressure from elevated medical costs.\n*   **Michael Cherny:** Leerink Partners analyst who noted CVS's results weren't surprising given others' performance.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   About half of CVS's group Medicare Advantage plans are set to be repriced next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** CVS Health's Aetna turnaround boosts outlook, defying broader insurer struggles.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Trump administration announced an initiative Wednesday that aims to boost health data sharing through partnerships with major healthcare and technology firms, including Amazon, Google, UnitedHealth and Epic.\n\nThe Health Tech Ecosystem focuses on two areas: encouraging adoption of a voluntary blueprint for data sharing called CMS Interoperability Framework and increasing the availability of digital health tools, like products for chronic disease management and care navigation, the CMS said in a press release.\n\nMore than 60 companies \u2014 including technology firms, providers, insurers and health data sharing networks \u2014 have pledged to participate in the initiative. The partnership aims to \u201cdeliver results for the American people\u201d in the first quarter next year, the CMS said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nInteroperability and information sharing is a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector, made harder by siloed data that doesn\u2019t easily flow between providers and a reliance on dated technology like fax machines.\n\nStill, the industry has seen some recent progress on health data sharing. In late 2023, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, a governance framework for information exchange, went live after years of effort.\n\nTEFCA launched with five Qualified Health Information Networks, or QHINs, and their number has since expanded to nine, including new additions like e-prescribing Surescripts\u2019 data exchange and ambulatory electronic health record vendor eClinicalWorks.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is launching its own data sharing initiative. It includes the CMS Interoperability Framework, which the agency said is a \u201ccall to action for health data networks that want to move faster.\u201d\n\nThe framework\u2019s criteria are supposed to be \u201cvisionary,\u201d the CMS said. Some of the goals include ensuring patients can access their electronic medical data anywhere on the network, using apps of their choice.\n\nPatients should also be able to access claims, explanation of benefits and prior authorizations from current and past payers, and data queries should be responded to quickly \u2014 possibly in real time, according to the CMS.\n\n\u201cFor too long, patients in this country have been burdened with a healthcare system that has not kept pace with the disruptive innovations that have transformed nearly every other sector of our economy,\u201d CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. \u201cWith the commitments made by these entrepreneurial companies today, we stand ready for a paradigm shift in the U.S. healthcare system for the benefit of patients and providers.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one companies have pledged to become CMS Aligned Networks, including EHR and health IT vendors like Epic, Oracle Health and athenahealth, as well as data exchanges that have received QHIN status like CommonWell Health Alliance and eClinicalWorks.\n\nThe CMS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by press time on how the latest data sharing initiative will interact with TEFCA.\n\nAdditionally, eleven health systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Bon Secours Mercy Health and Intermountain Health, said they would participate in the networks. They pledged to accept patient information through digital tools to help \u201ckill the clipboard\u201d \u2014 or stop requiring patients to fill out medical histories on paper before visits.\n\nThirty companies, like Google, Apple and Samsung, joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology, according to the CMS.\n\nThat includes a pledge to allow patients to retrieve their health data through the network or personal apps, and then share that information with providers. Other firms signed on to use the network or apps to access health data to provide support to patients managing diabetes or obesity.",

The initiative focuses on adopting a voluntary CMS Interoperability Framework and increasing digital health tools for chronic disease management. Over 60 companies have pledged to participate, aiming to deliver results by the first quarter next year.\n\n**Why it matters:** This initiative aims to tackle the long-standing challenge of interoperability and information sharing in healthcare, which is hindered by siloed data and dated technology. The CMS calls it a \"call to action for health data networks that want to move faster,\" suggesting dissatisfaction with current progress.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe pharmacy benefit manager marketplace is dominated by a handful of large players, many of which are vertically consolidated with health insurers, according to a new paper from a top medical association.\n\nOn average, local PBM markets are highly concentrated across services like rebate negotiation, retail network management and claims adjudication, according to the study from the American Medical Association. And nationally, 77% of people in prescription drug plans are covered by an insurer that\u2019s vertically integrated with a PBM.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s paper is the latest in a number of studies finding a lack of competition in the PBM landscape, which experts say could be harming consumers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPBMs, which manage prescription drug benefits for the majority of Americans, were created decades ago to help insurers contain drug spending. But scrutiny of the drug middlemen has been ramping up amid concerns they may not be passing savings through to clients and that their negotiations with drugmakers could be inflating pharmaceutical prices, among other concerns.\n\nThe current situation can be traced back to a lack of competition in the PBM landscape, experts say. Just three companies \u2014 Optum Rx, Caremark and Express Scripts \u2014 jointly control 80% of the U.S. prescription drug market, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nCritics, including antitrust regulators, allege that those \u201cBig Three\u201d are leveraging their size to profit from their middleman role in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s new paper used 2022 and 2023 data from Medicare and commercial prescription drug plans and the FTC\u2019s measure of market concentration to determine competition in PBM markets. It found on average high levels of concentration and vertical consolidation, when the same company owns both an insurer and a PBM.\n\nConcentration levels were similar across PBM functions that plans and employers generally contract out: rebate negotiation, retail network management and claims adjudication, according to the paper.\n\nFor example, the study found that in 2023 Optum Rx, which is owned by UnitedHealth, was the largest PBM in the U.S. when it came to rebate negotiation, with 22.2% of the market. Optum Rx was followed by CVS\u2019 Caremark, which held an 18.9% share, and Express Scripts, which held a 15.5% share.\n\nPrime Therapeutics, a PBM that\u2019s jointly owned by a number of Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers, rounded out the top four, with 10.6% of the rebate negotiation market.\n\nHowever, more recent estimates of market concentration say Express Scripts holds a larger share of the market, after the PBM won a massive Centene contract that went into effect last year. The AMA said that next year\u2019s edition of the study, which will be based on data from 2024, should rank Express Scripts as the second largest or largest PBM nationally.\n\nOf the 10 largest PBMs in the rebate negotiation market, nine share ownership with health insurers, the AMA study found.\n\nMedImpact is the only PBM that wasn\u2019t affiliated with a health insurer \u2014 though, the company sells a standalone prescription drug plan, so technically all 10 are vertically integrated, the AMA said.\n\n\u201cThese are important findings because low competition may lead to higher prices paid by insurers for PBM services, higher insurance premiums, PBMs not fully passing rebates through, and lower reimbursement to pharmacies,\u201d the AMA\u2019s paper reads. \u201cMoreover, given extensive vertical integration of insurers and PBMs, non-affiliated insurers may be losing access to PBMs.\u201d\n\nThe AMA\u2019s paper is the latest call for antitrust regulators and lawmakers to give PBM consolidation more scrutiny. A number of state attorneys general, independent pharmacy groups and other experts have all asked Congress to consider breaking up leading PBMs.\n\nThe FTC is currently suing Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx for allegedly driving up the cost of insulin, after publishing a pair of damning reports about their business practices. Congress has also shown an interest in reforming PBMs, with House and Senate committees holding numerous hearings in the past three years.\n\nLawmakers have introduced dozens of bills referencing the drug middlemen, running the gamut from forcing PBMs to disclose more information on their business practices to decoupling PBM compensation from the prices of drugs.\n\nConcrete legislation hasn\u2019t made it across the finish line, though some Washington watchers expect legislators to work to pass PBM reform in appropriations legislation closer to the end of 2025. Still, that\u2019s left a gap that states are stepping into: All 50 states have enacted laws targeting PBMs in an effort to lower prescription drug pricing, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.\n\nThe 186 pieces of state laws include those forbidding PBMs from stopping pharmacies from telling patients about cheaper drug alternatives or charging pharmacies extra fees, prohibiting PBMs from spread pricing and requiring PBMs to share more information about rebates and fees with the state.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMedicare Part D premiums are likely to increase next year, according to preliminary data released Monday by the CMS.\n\nThe average national monthly bid submitted by insurers for 2026 prescription drug plans was $239.27, increasing 33% from last year. The base beneficiary premium is $38.99, rising 6% year over year, the max amount allowed by law.\n\nAdditionally, the CMS said it would continue a voluntary demonstration implemented this year that aims to stabilize Part D premiums, but with some changes. \u201cDespite the program adjustments, we view the continuation of the demo in any form as incrementally positive\u201d for health plans, Ryan Langston, an analyst at TD Cowen, wrote in a Monday note.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMedicare beneficiaries have two options for receiving outpatient prescription drug insurance: They can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan that includes drug coverage or a standalone Part D plan that supplements traditional Medicare.\n\nInsurers contract with the federal government to administer Part D plans. Each summer, health plans submit a bid to the CMS, estimating their benefit payments and administrative costs for the average Medicare beneficiary.\n\nRegulators use this data to calculate the nationwide average bid and the base premium \u2014 what beneficiaries have to pay, plus the difference between their plan\u2019s bid and the nationwide average bid.\n\nThe CMS also pays a direct subsidy to plans, which fills the gap between average benchmark and the base premium. The direct subsidy for 2026 will be $200.28, rising from $142.67 this year, according to TD Cowen analysts.\n\nThe Medicare Part D bids come as healthcare costs continue to rise, driven by increasing pharmacy expenses for medications like pricey GLP-1s.\n\nIn a fact sheet on the bid data published Monday, the CMS said it took \u201cunprecedented action\u201d to hold insurers accountable for premium increases, including by negotiating bid terms and conditions, and denying bids that included significant increases in cost sharing or a decrease in benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the CMS announced it would make some changes to the Part D Premium Stabilization Demonstration, which was first put in place in 2025 to keep premiums steady and give more predictable options to enrollees.\n\nThe demonstration initially included a uniform reduction of $15 to the base beneficiary premium, a year-over-year increase limit of $35 on a plan\u2019s total Part D premium and narrowed risk corridors. For next year, regulators will decrease the uniform reduction to $10 and increase the Part D limit to $50, as well as cutting the narrowed risk corridor thresholds entirely.\n\n\u201cBy reducing the amount of premium stabilization from the government in 2026, we are facilitating the program\u2019s return to operating under regular market conditions,\u201d the CMS wrote.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Medicare Part D Premiums Jump for 2026; CMS Acts on Insurer Bids\n\n**Key details:**\nPreliminary data from the CMS indicates Medicare Part D premiums will rise in 2026. The average national monthly bid submitted by insurers increased 33% to $239.27. The base beneficiary premium is set at $38.99, a 6% year-over-year increase, which is the maximum allowed by law. Additionally, CMS announced changes to its Part D Premium Stabilization Demonstration, reducing the uniform premium reduction to $10 and increasing the Part D limit to $50.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe projected increase in premiums will directly affect Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. The CMS stated it took \"unprecedented action\" by negotiating bid terms and denying some bids to hold insurers accountable for premium increases. This action, alongside reducing government premium stabilization to \"facilitate the program\u2019s return to operating under regular market conditions,\" challenges a potential consensus view that government intervention would consistently maintain previous subsidy levels or less scrutiny on insurers. Despite these changes, an analyst at TD Cowen views the demonstration's continuation as \"incrementally positive\" for health plans.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMedicare beneficiaries have options for drug coverage: through Medicare Advantage plans or standalone Part D plans that supplement traditional Medicare. Insurers annually submit bids to the federal government's CMS, estimating benefit payments and administrative costs for drug plans. Regulators use this data to calculate the nationwide average bid and the base premium for beneficiaries. The CMS also pays a direct subsidy to plans, which is set to rise for 2026. These developments occur as healthcare costs continue to climb, largely driven by increasing pharmacy expenses for expensive medications like GLP-1s.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Average national monthly bid (2026): $239.27 (up 33% from last year)\n*   Base beneficiary premium (2026): $38.99 (up 6% year over year, max allowed)\n*   Direct subsidy (2026): $200.28 (up from $142.67 this year)\n*   Uniform reduction in demonstration: Decreased from $15 to $10\n*   Part D limit in demonstration: Increased from $35 to $50\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services):** Released preliminary data on Part D premiums, continues and adjusted stabilization demonstration, and took \"unprecedented action\" on insurer bids.\n*   **TD Cowen:** Financial analysis firm whose analysts provided direct subsidy data and commented on the positive implications of the demonstration for health plans.\n*   **Ryan Langston:** Analyst at TD Cowen, views the continuation of the Part D Premium Stabilization Demonstration as incrementally positive for health plans.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nHigher Medicare Part D premiums loom for 2026, challenging beneficiaries, mixed for health plans.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nHotel Tech-in is our regular feature that takes a closer look at emerging technology in the hospitality industry.\n\nViewing renderings and taking virtual walk-throughs of hotel event spaces have been a go-to way for event planners to source venues for years. But the COVID-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on their importance, as in-person tours were temporarily halted.\n\nSince that time, innovation in the space has accelerated, with virtual event maps becoming more complex, customizable and detailed. More recently, they\u2019ve gone 3D.\n\n\u201cWe've heard from our planner sourcing reports that floor plans and diagrams and 3D virtual tours are increasingly important,\u201d Janine Alsalam, vice president of sales, Hospitality Cloud at Cvent, told Hotel Dive. \u201cThey're among the top elements that are helping them make their decisions for which venues to source.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to evolve its event map offerings, Cvent acquired Prismm, a platform that offers 3D layouts of venues, in April. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Following the deal, Cvent has been integrating Prismm\u2019s technology into its event-mapping platform, accelerating the push to 3D diagramming.\n\n\u201cWe've been doing a lot of learning about the best and greatest of both [Cvent\u2019s and Prismm\u2019s] platforms, and our vision is to bring those together into a combined solution that really meets the market need,\u201d Alsalam said.\n\nHotel Dive spoke to Alsalam about why the company was drawn to Prismm\u2019s offerings, next steps for the technology\u2019s integration and the future of event mapping hotel venues.\n\nEvent mappers join forces\n\nPrismm, which was founded in 2014 under the name Allseated, first launched its 3D layout tool in 2018, updating it later with augmented- and virtual-reality capabilities.\n\nAlsalam said 3D visualization is the biggest change to occur in the event-mapping space in years.\n\n\u201c3D in general has taken flight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was already developing in terms [of becoming a] better technology [with] more expectations for it, but then the pandemic accelerated that quite a bit.\u201d\n\nPrismm creates its virtual walk-throughs by sending a team of photographers to a venue to capture it using Matterport 3D cameras. The resulting maps not only show the venues as they are, but also allow users such as event planners to insert 3D models of objects into the floor plan, which Alsalam said is useful for event design as well as for \u201ccreating a visual showcase of your sample layouts for [a hotel\u2019s] sales and marketing team.\u201d\n\nCvent had already been working behind the scenes to improve its own event-mapping technology, which also included virtual walk-throughs of floor plans, Alsalam shared, but the company targeted Prismm for an acquisition because \u201cwe had two different ways to accomplish a similar goal, which is helping planners and venues visualize the space.\u201d\n\nPost-combination, Cvent and Prismm have more than 12,000 customers of their diagramming tool globally, Alsalam said, adding that venues that display virtual tours on Cvent\u2019s networks get approximately 2.5% more leads than those that don\u2019t.\n\nSupplementing, not replacing\n\nAlsalam said 3D mapping is supplementing in-person site visits \u2014 not replacing them. According to Alsalam, event planners say having instant access to a 3D model is helpful throughout the planning process and not just when they\u2019re selecting a hotel partner.\n\nAt the same time, virtual models can reduce an event\u2019s environmental impact if fewer people are needed to travel to a site. \u201cMany companies are trying to lower their carbon footprint and avoid site visits for smaller meetings,\u201d Alsalam noted.\n\nWith Prismm under Cvent's umbrella, there are further ways to integrate the companies' products. Alsalam said Cvent is considering flexible pricing that allows for a higher-priced premium offering and a less expensive version.\n\nCvent also plans on integrating Prismm\u2019s collaborative features, which give everyone from venue operators to planners and catering teams access to adjust floor plans.\n\n\u201cFrom a venue side, you want to make sure that you're giving those planners the tools to really design an event that you're going to be able to execute on-site,\u201d Alsalam said. \u201cA lot of times, the planner is owning the design. In other cases, it\u2019s the venue that's owning the design.\n\n\u201cWe're leaning really heavily into that collaborative nature of the product,\u201d Alsalam said.",

Cvent's acquisition targeted Prismm to combine their distinct approaches to helping planners and venues visualize space.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Prismm was founded in 2014 under the name Allseated.\n*   Prismm first launched its 3D layout tool in 2018.\n*   Cvent acquired Prismm in April.\n*   More than 12,000 customers globally use their combined diagramming tool.\n*   Venues displaying virtual tours on Cvent\u2019s networks get approximately 2.5% more leads.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Cvent:** Acquired Prismm to accelerate its 3D event mapping and visualization offerings.\n*   **Prismm:** Acquired by Cvent, offering 3D layouts and virtual walk-throughs of venues.\n*   **Janine Alsalam:** Cvent's VP of Sales, Hospitality Cloud, provided insights on the acquisition and market trends.\n*   **Hotel Dive:** Interviewed Janine Alsalam about the integration and future of hotel event mapping.\n*   **Allseated:** Original name of Prismm when it was founded in 2014.\n*   **Matterport:** Provider of 3D cameras used by Prismm to capture venue images for virtual tours.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Cvent plans to continue integrating Prismm's technology into its event-mapping platform.\n*   Cvent is considering flexible pricing models and integrating Prismm\u2019s collaborative features.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Cvent's Prismm acquisition boosts 3D event mapping, addressing growing planner demand.",

When it opens next year, the hotel will be a game-changer for the Midwestern Indiana city.\n\n\u201cWe'll be the tallest hotel in Indianapolis,\u201d Signia by Hilton Indianapolis General Manager Kathy Heneghan told Hotel Dive. \u201cEveryone is pretty amazed at how it's changing the view of the skyline in Indianapolis.\u201d\n\nBut the new hotel \u2014 which connects to the city\u2019s Indiana Convention Center by skywalk \u2014 will impact more than the skyline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the classic tide that raises all ships,\u201d Leonard Hoops, president and CEO of destination management organization Visit Indy, told Hotel Dive. When the Signia hotel opens, Hoops said, Indianapolis will be able to host more citywide conventions, putting Indianapolis\u2019 events market on par with major cities like Chicago.\n\nWhile Signia is the largest hotel under construction in Indianapolis, it\u2019s part of a broader wave of hotel development in the city, which is attracting larger and higher-end projects as demand for business travel and large-scale events rises, experts shared.\n\nHotel Dive spoke with city hospitality and tourism professionals about what\u2019s driving the development surge, which cities Indianapolis competes with and how the destination plans to add more inbound leisure travelers into the mix.\n\nConvention demand\n\nIndianapolis, which has a metro-area population of approximately 2.1 million, \u201cis just exploding,\u201d said Heneghan.\n\nMuch of that explosion is due to convention demand, which led to 932,000 hotel room nights booked in 2024, according to Visit Indy.\n\nOf Indianapolis\u2019 top 10 days for hotel demand ever, nine were in 2024, thanks in part to events like the solar eclipse and Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. Out of all U.S. markets in the path of totality, Indianapolis saw the greatest year-over-year RevPAR increase (up 660%) from the eclipse, according to STR.\n\nIn its initial announcement of the Signia, Hilton called Indianapolis \u201cone of the United States\u2019 highly acclaimed convention cities.\u201d\n\nAdding the Signia hotel and its 90,000 square feet of meeting space \u2014 including a 50,000-square-foot ballroom, which will be the largest in Indiana \u2014 will allow Visit Indy to host two citywide events at once, Heneghan said.\n\n\u201cWhereas now, there's only the ability to host one [citywide convention],\u201d she noted. \u201cThis hotel and the meeting space that it brings is going to elevate the level of business that we can do in the city.\n\n\u201cMeeting planners are incredibly excited to see that there is this level of luxury that's attached to a convention center,\u201d she added.\n\n\"There's a lot of developers who are pretty bullish about the Indy market moving forward, and so we aim to prove them to be smart about their investments.\u201d Leonard Hoops president and CEO of Visit Indy\n\nWhile additional hotel projects are underway, the Signia stands out because it \u201cwill bring new business to Indianapolis,\u201d Hoops noted. But it\u2019s taken a long time to get here, he added.\n\nAfter Visit Indy advocated for the Signia project, \u201cwe pretty much stopped advocating [for additional hotels] because that's a lot of rooms of inventory to add,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cBut there's a lot of developers who are doing these things on their own, who are pretty bullish about the Indy market moving forward, and so we aim to prove them to be smart about their investments.\u201d\n\nOngoing development\n\nOne of those developers is Ersal Ozdemir, the founder and owner of Keystone Group, which opened the InterContinental Indianapolis in February after a $120 million restoration of a historic downtown building.\n\nThe 170-room luxury hotel features 5,000 square feet of meetings and events space, including a 2,500-square-foot ballroom.\n\nBy the numbers +660% Indianapolis' year-on-year RevPAR increase during the 2024 solar eclipse, the highest of any U.S. market 932,000 Indianapolis hotel rooms booked on the back of convention demand in 2024 800 The number of convention center-adjacent rooms Signia by Hilton will bring to Indianapolis when it opens in 2026\n\n\u201cOur goal is that we not only want to develop great buildings, but we want to help to elevate the city,\u201d Ozdemir told Hotel Dive. For Keystone Group, that meant spending more than anticipated to create a rooftop bar, which has already hosted elite gatherings for events travelers, Ozdemir shared.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing a lot more interest in that upper-upscale, boutique side,\u201d said Hoops. Other hotels under construction downtown include a Kimpton \u2014 which, like InterContinental, is part of IHG Hotels & Resorts\u2019 growing luxury and lifestyle portfolio \u2014 and the Shinola Hotel, a project from Detroit-based luxury design brand Shinola. Meanwhile, Ennismore plans to open a 21c Museum Hotel in a historic city hall building in 2028, inclusive of the art-focused hotel brand\u2019s largest-ever gallery space.\n\nOutside of downtown, Marriott International\u2019s Westin brand broke ground last month on a $205.8 million hotel at Indianapolis International Airport.\n\nExisting hotels are getting upgrades, too: Omni Severin Hotel recently underwent a $24 million renovation, and both the JW Marriott Indianapolis and Crowne Plaza Indianapolis recently unveiled the results of their $15 million revamps, according to Visit Indy.\n\n\u201cWe not only want to develop great buildings, but we want to help to elevate the city.\u201d Ersal Ozdemir founder and owner, Keystone Group\n\nAccording to Ozdemir, the difference between downtown Indianapolis now and 20 years ago is like \u201cday and night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've not been to another city that has so many hotels either built or getting ready to be built within walking distance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city\u2019s walkability is a big selling point for its hotels, according to Visit Indy. Indianapolis was designed by Alexander Ralston, an apprentice of Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant, who designed Washington, D.C. The city\u2019s layout, then, is not dissimilar from the capital\u2019s, Hoops said. Like D.C., many of Indianapolis\u2019 streets are named after states, and a Monument Circle in the city center features roads spiking out in diagonals.\n\nHeneghan said she notes the city\u2019s walkability when speaking to event planners. \u201cEverything is connected,\u201d she said.\n\nFuture projects\n\nIn terms of citywide conventions, Hoops said, Indianapolis rivals the best. \u201cWe compete absolutely nationally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go up against Orlando, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe next step is building a leisure travel segment that matches, he noted, adding that Indianapolis is looking to Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWe're just a little bit behind where Austin was, and where Nashville was, a few years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth of those cities, however, are known for their music scenes \u2014 something Indianapolis hopes to beef up with its forthcoming 4,000-seat music venue by Live Nation Entertainment. At the same time, Visit Indy plans on creating more activations around the White River, which flows through downtown.\n\nMeanwhile, sports tourism \u2014 such as the recent WNBA All-Star Game \u2014 continues to drive leisure travelers to the city.\n\n\"People kind of sleep on Indianapolis, but I remind them that Paris is a flat city with a river, and so is Indianapolis,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cTheir only advantage is a 2,000-year headstart.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Indianapolis hotel boom driven by conventions; aims for leisure growth.\n\n**Key details:** Hilton's 800-room luxury Signia hotel, the brand's second ground-up build, is set to open in 2026 in downtown Indianapolis, becoming the city's tallest hotel. It will connect to the Indiana Convention Center and offer 90,000 square feet of meeting space, including Indiana's largest ballroom. This new capacity will allow Indianapolis to host two citywide conventions simultaneously, a significant increase from its current ability to host only one. The Signia project is a key part of a wider surge in higher-end hotel development across the city.\n\n**Why it matters:** The influx of new luxury hotel projects, particularly the Signia, is poised to significantly elevate Indianapolis's status in the convention and events market. This development allows Indianapolis to host more citywide conventions, directly putting its events market on par with major cities like Chicago. This activity challenges a potential consensus that Indianapolis is an underperforming convention city, with experts noting it's \"exploding\" and developers being \"bullish\" on the market. The increased luxury offerings are also exciting meeting planners and could attract new business to the city.\n\n**The big picture:** Indianapolis, with a metro-area population of 2.1 million, is experiencing an \"explosion\" in hotel development driven primarily by strong convention demand. The city recorded 932,000 hotel room nights booked from convention demand in 2024, with nine of its top ten hotel demand days ever occurring this year, partly due to events like the solar eclipse and Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. While Visit Indy initially advocated for the Signia, other developers are independently pursuing new projects, including the InterContinental Indianapolis and future Kimpton and Shinola hotels. This ongoing development aims to elevate the city and attract more business and leisure travelers.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   +660%: Indianapolis' year-on-year RevPAR increase during the 2024 solar eclipse, the highest of any U.S. market.\n*   932,000: Indianapolis hotel rooms booked due to convention demand in 2024.\n*   800: Number of convention center-adjacent rooms Signia by Hilton will add upon opening in 2026.\n*   90,000 square feet: Total meeting space at the new Signia hotel, including a 50,000-square-foot ballroom.\n*   2.1 million: Approximate metro-area population of Indianapolis.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Hilton:** Developer of the new 800-room luxury Signia hotel, impacting Indianapolis's skyline and convention capacity.\n*   **Kathy Heneghan:** Signia by Hilton Indianapolis General Manager, highlighted the hotel's changing view of the skyline.\n*   **Leonard Hoops:** President and CEO of Visit Indy, explained the new hotel's impact on citywide conventions.\n*   **Visit Indy:** Destination management organization tracking hotel demand and advocating for city development.\n*   **Ersal Ozdemir:** Founder/owner of Keystone Group, opened the InterContinental Indianapolis after a major restoration.\n*   **Keystone Group:** Developer that completed a $120 million restoration for the InterContinental Indianapolis.\n*   **IHG Hotels & Resorts:** Parent company for luxury brands Kimpton and InterContinental, both opening new hotels.\n*   **Shinola:** Luxury design brand planning to open the Shinola Hotel in downtown Indianapolis.\n*   **Ennismore:** Plans to open a 21c Museum Hotel in a historic city hall building in Indianapolis.\n*   **Marriott International:** Westin brand broke ground on a $205.8 million hotel at Indianapolis International Airport.\n*   **Live Nation Entertainment:** Planning a 4,000-seat music venue to boost Indianapolis's music scene.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The 800-room luxury Signia by Hilton hotel is slated to open in 2026, significantly increasing convention capacity.\n*   Watch for progress on Live Nation Entertainment's forthcoming 4,000-seat music venue, intended to boost Indianapolis's music scene.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Indianapolis is transforming into a major luxury convention and leisure destination.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nRegional properties were a bright spot for Caesars Entertainment in the second quarter of 2025, as the operator posted decreased revenues in Las Vegas amid softer market demand there, CEO Tom Reeg detailed in an earnings report published Tuesday.\n\nThe hotel operator opened properties in New Orleans and Danville, Virginia, in recent months, which primarily drove year-over-year regional segment net revenue growth of 3.6% in Q2, according to the report.\n\nIn its Las Vegas segment, though, Caesars posted a 3.7% year-over-year decline in net revenues in the quarter. The disappointing results come on the heels of dampened demand in Caesars\u2019 Las Vegas hospitality verticals, Reeg shared, though group demand appears strong going forward.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCaesars\u2019 Las Vegas segment was \u201csofter than last year\u201d in the second quarter, as the market\u2019s booking window contracted, Reeg said during an earnings call Tuesday. Caesars\u2019 adjusted EBITDA declined 8% year over year in Las Vegas in the quarter.\n\n\u201c[The] booking window in Vegas is about as short as I\u2019ve seen it at this point,\u201d Reeg said. \u201cVegas started leaking as of May, [and] that leak accelerated into June.\u201d\n\nCaesars\u2019 Las Vegas segment was down 27,000 room nights in the second quarter, Reeg stated on the call, noting a dip in international visitors.\n\n\u201cInternational business, particularly Canadian, is softer. If you look at our missing room nights this year, Canadians are a significant piece of that,\u201d Reeg said.\n\nThe U.S. is on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025 following recent U.S. government actions, the World Travel & Tourism Council reported in May. Elevated macroeconomic concerns are also poised to impact hotel performance this year and next, CoStar and Tourism Economics forecasted last month.\n\nAt the NYU International Hospitality Investment Forum in New York City last month, STR President Amanda Hite said hotel demand nationwide for July and August was down compared to 2024 due partly to travelers\u2019 now-shortened booking windows.\n\nReeg expects Caesars\u2019 third-quarter results in Sin City to be soft as well, though he noted that group demand is promising beyond that.\n\nThere is a \u201cvery strong group calendar\u201d for Caesars in the fourth quarter of this year as well as the first and second quarters of 2026, according to Reeg.\n\nMeanwhile, in the regional segment, \u201cNew Orleans had another very strong quarter, and has picked up the pace in July,\u201d Reeg said. Caesars\u2019 recently opened resort in Virginia \u201ccontinues to perform extraordinarily well,\u201d he added.\n\nJust after the close of the quarter, Caesars debuted the rebranded Caesars Republic Lake Tahoe Hotel & Casino in Nevada.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Caesars' regional properties shine as Las Vegas revenues decline.\n\n**Key details:**\nCaesars Entertainment's Q2 2025 earnings show regional properties were a bright spot, posting 3.6% year-over-year net revenue growth. This regional growth was primarily driven by newly opened properties in New Orleans and Danville, Virginia. In contrast, the Las Vegas segment posted a 3.7% year-over-year decline in net revenues due to dampened demand. Las Vegas adjusted EBITDA also declined 8% year-over-year. The CEO noted a shorter booking window in Vegas, leading to 27,000 fewer room nights, partly due to a dip in international visitors, especially Canadians.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis information highlights a significant shift in Caesars' revenue drivers, with regional performance now offsetting weakness in its core Las Vegas market. The decline in Las Vegas revenues and adjusted EBITDA, coupled with a shortened booking window, challenges the previous assumption of consistent, strong demand in a major hospitality hub. It suggests that the market's reliance on international visitors and long-term bookings may be more vulnerable than previously considered, potentially impacting the consensus view of the stability and growth trajectory of large-scale Las Vegas operators. Investors may need to re-evaluate the resilience of diversified regional portfolios compared to concentrated major market exposure.\n\n**The big picture:**\nBroader market trends contextualize Caesars' Las Vegas struggles. The U.S. is on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025 following recent U.S. government actions, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Additionally, elevated macroeconomic concerns are poised to impact hotel performance this year and next, as forecasted by CoStar and Tourism Economics.

Council keeps subminimum tipped wage, defying voter mandate again.\n\n**Key details:** The Washington, D.C., city council approved a measure preserving the tipped subminimum wage, overriding the will of voters for the second time in seven years. The council voted for an amendment to Initiative 82, not a full repeal, according to the National Restaurant Association. This amendment holds the minimum wage for tipped workers at $10 an hour until July 1, 2026. After that date, gradual increases are permitted until 2034, when employers will be required to pay tipped workers 75% of the district\u2019s minimum wage.\n\n**Why it matters:** This decision maintains a lower labor cost structure for employers in the D.C. hospitality sector than if a full minimum wage were implemented for tipped workers. It signals the city council's preference for a phased, lower wage increase for these workers, despite voter initiatives. This action challenges any consensus view that D.C. was moving quickly towards a \"one fair wage\" model, as the council has now twice acted to preserve the subminimum wage system. For investors, this means slower-than-anticipated increases in labor expenses for D.C. businesses employing tipped staff.\n\n**The big picture:** This is the second time in seven years the Washington, D.C., city council has overridden the will of voters regarding the tipped subminimum wage. The council's recent vote amended Initiative 82, preventing its full repeal. This move also follows a previous council vote less than two months ago, which acted to pause wage increases.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDon Brock is a retired senior executive with more than 25 years of experience in food and consumer product manufacturing. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nManufacturing in the United States isn\u2019t romantic.\n\nDespite what glossy ads, political speeches and tech expos suggest \u2014 gleaming robots, spotless factories and the promise of bringing jobs back home \u2014 the reality is more brutal.\n\nI\u2019ve learned it\u2019s steel-toed boots, long hours and being measured by your last shift, your last run, your last screw-up. And for those who stay it\u2019s also about pride, grit and mastery. But none of it comes easily.\n\nAs the country talks about reviving American industry, the real question is whether our workforce \u2014 and our expectations \u2014 are ready for what that truly demands. These are some of my lessons from decades on the job.\n\nThe entry point is hard, fast and underpaid\n\nMost people don't \"choose\" manufacturing; they land in it. Sometimes from a technical school. Often from circumstance. You get your foot in the door \u2014 running a filler, packing pallets, loading raw materials \u2014 and you realize quickly that no one's waiting to hand you anything.\n\nThe work is physical. The pay at the beginning is barely enough. Maybe $18 an hour, if you're lucky. Maybe rotating 12-hour shifts with no child care. The benefits vary widely \u2014 union shops can be solid; non-union ones often tread the fine line between acceptable and exploitative.\n\nAnd the unspoken reality is you may experience injuries, repetitive stress, line fatigue and night shifts that screw up your sleep for years.\n\nThe climb has no map, few guides\n\nMoving up in manufacturing requires more than hustle. It takes visibility, timing and often politics.\n\nThe best operators don't always become supervisors. The best supervisors don't always get promoted. And there's usually no clear pathway \u2014 just a mix of luck, attrition and whoever happens to be watching.\n\nMiddle management? That's where careers either advance or stall. You're stuck between the C-suite's cost obsession and the frontline's daily chaos. You make decisions no one thanks you for and get blamed for outcomes you didn't control.\n\nLeadership in manufacturing is not about glossy strategy decks. It's about walking the floor when you're exhausted, defusing conflicts with HR breathing down your neck, keeping lines running when half the crew calls out and still hitting a margin target that was set by someone who's never touched a valve or heard a piston seize.\n\nThe culture is a mixed bag\n\nThe culture varies. Some plants are toxic: blame-heavy, turf-driven, unsafe. Others are tight-knit, even familial, where veterans look out for rookies and you solve problems with duct tape and a handshake.\n\nBut make no mistake: ego, burnout and generational divides are everywhere. The old guard resents the new hires. The latest hires roll their eyes at \"the way we've always done it.\" HR often spends more time rolling out diversity initiatives than addressing the real, unresolved safety issues on the third shift, where the newest, least experienced workers face the highest risks.\n\nAnd most outsiders \u2014 executives, consultants and media \u2014 don\u2019t understand what it takes to build something, fix something or keep it running continuously 24/7 without failure.\n\nThe rewards are real, but earned\n\nIf you survive the grind \u2014 and learn to lead \u2014 manufacturing offers something no desk job can. You can point to something and say, \"We made that.\"\n\nYou learn systems. You learn people. You learn what it means to stand up under pressure and keep going when everything's breaking. And for some, you learn how to transform not just product, but culture \u2014 how to lead turnarounds, build teams and leave plants better than you found them.\n\nYes, the money gets better. Six figures is attainable if you transition into operations leadership, technical direction or supply chain management. But you'll earn every penny in sleepless nights, holiday calls and constant stress.\n\nAnd still, you might get laid off after a merger and reorganized when a private equity group cuts costs or pushed out when you're \"too expensive\" after building the whole damn system.\n\nIt's either a calling, or it breaks you\n\nManufacturing, although not easy, has been a productive career for me. However, are we willing to invest in what it takes to make that the case for everyone?\n\nManufacturing will harden you, humble you, and \u2014 if you let it \u2014 shape you into something fierce and capable. But it\u2019s not for the faint of heart or the glory seeker.\n\nIt\u2019s for those who believe in execution over excuses, in teams over titles and in building things that matter \u2014 even when no one\u2019s looking.\n\nSo, what\u2019s it like to build a career in U.S. manufacturing? It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s real work.\n\nAs the country rallies around the idea of bringing manufacturing back home, we need to ask: Is this truly what we want? And if so, are we prepared to invest in the education, training and cultural readiness it demands?",

Career advancement lacks a clear path, with middle management facing immense pressure caught between executive cost demands and frontline chaos. While some plant cultures are tight-knit, many suffer from toxicity, ego, and generational divides. Leadership roles can offer six-figure salaries, but are earned through constant stress, sleepless nights, and the risk of layoff.\n\n**Why it matters:** This perspective challenges the prevalent public and political narrative of a romanticized U.S. manufacturing revival, often depicted with gleaming robots and easy job creation. The author argues the reality is far more brutal, demanding, and often underpaid, questioning if the workforce and national expectations are truly ready. This suggests a significant disconnect between the popular vision of reshoring jobs and the actual investment needed in education, training, and cultural readiness.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon repeatedly violated the National Labor Relations Act when supervisors and loss prevention personnel prohibited off-duty employees from engaging in union-organizing and other protected activity in warehouse parking lots in Chicago, St. Louis and New York state, an administrative law judge for the National Labor Relations Board held July 23.\n\nThe incidents involved similar actions by Amazon\u2019s agents, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings in Amazon.com Services LLC and Duzinkas. For example, in one incident, two off-duty Amazon employees were in the parking lot of a Chicago-area warehouse handing out petitions seeking to raise Amazon\u2019s base minimum wage. A loss prevention agent asked what they were doing and told them he would call the police if they didn\u2019t leave. The police did arrive, and they left, according to the findings.\n\nIn ruling against Amazon, the ALJ explained that NLRB has long held employers may not bar off-duty employees from outside nonworking areas, including parking lots. Amazon violated Section 8(a)1 of the NLRA when it tried to do this to keep off-duty employees from engaging in protected activity, the judge held. Amazon also violated Section 8(a)1 when it called the police to further bar protected activity, the ALJ said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSection 8(a)1 of the NLRA prohibits employers from interfering with or restraining employees from exercising the statute\u2019s core rights, spelled out in Section 7 of the act.\n\nThese core rights \u2014 considered \u201cprotected activity\u201d and often referred to as \u201cSection 7 rights\u201d \u2014 include the right to organize and \u201cengage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d\n\nThe issues here arose in 2022 and 2023, during a heated union campaign to organize Amazon warehouse workers at multiple facilities. The ALJ found Amazon\u2019s actions in telling off-duty employees to leave the parking lots while they were trying to garner union support from co-workers and campaign for better working conditions and pay interfered with their Section 7 rights and violated Section 8(a)1.\n\nOne incident took place outside Amazon\u2019s St. Peters, Missouri, warehouse, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings. An off-duty employee active in an organizing committee stationed himself in the parking lot to get co-workers to sign a petition demanding improvements to warehouse safety.\n\nAs the off-duty employee was putting flyers on vehicles near the facility entrance, a security officer from a third-party vendor wearing an Amazon badge approached him, the ALJ found. The officer told the off-duty employee he wasn\u2019t allowed to distribute the flyers in the parking lot and that if the officer went inside to get the police and loss prevention, they would tell him the same thing. The employee immediately left.\n\nThe ALJ ruled that the officer was acting as an agent for Amazon and his statements were unlawful. This was because pursuant to an established NLRB holding, \u201cthe distribution by off-duty employees of union literature in company parking lots is clearly protected by Section 7 of the Act, absent a showing that any work performed there is integral to business operations,\u201d the ALJ noted, quoting NLRB.\n\nThe case also offers a tip on employer no-solicitation policies. Amazon\u2019s policy started out valid by stating that solicitation by employees was prohibited on company property during working time, the ALJ said.\n\nBut the policy ultimately violated the NLRA because it failed to make clear to a reasonable employee \u201cthat solicitation is permitted in work areas during non-working time,\u201d the judge held.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Workday must disclose AI customer list in age bias lawsuit.\n\n**Key details:** A U.S. District Court judge ruled Tuesday Workday Inc. must provide a list of customers using its HiredScore artificial intelligence features. This order includes technology acquired after the initial complaint in a collective action lawsuit. The collective now encompasses individuals whose applications were scored, sorted, ranked, or screened using HiredScore AI. Workday had previously claimed HiredScore was a separate product with different algorithms and technology.\n\n**Why it matters:** This ruling significantly expands the scope of the collective action lawsuit against Workday, including customers using acquired AI technology. It suggests that companies integrating new AI tools, even through acquisition, may face increased legal scrutiny regarding their historical use. For investors, this broadens the potential liability and data disclosure requirements for Workday beyond its initially cited Candidate Skills Match. It challenges the view that acquired technology would be distinct from existing legal challenges.\n\n**The big picture:** A collective action lawsuit against Workday alleges its AI-based applicant recommendation software negatively impacted candidates aged 40 and up. AI in hiring is a significant point of contention in employment law, with New York City already restricting its use since 2023. California and Colorado are also slated to implement AI hiring regulations by 2026. The broader industry sees private companies like LinkedIn adding AI tools for recruiters, creating a current \"gray area\" of regulation.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Individuals aged 40 and up are part of the collective action.\n*   New York City's AI hiring laws went into effect in 2023.\n*   California and Colorado are slated to have AI hiring regulations in 2026.\n*   Workday must provide the customer list by Aug. 20.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Workday Inc.:** Company ordered to provide a list of customers using its AI hiring features.\n*   **HiredScore:** Acquired AI technology whose features are now included in the lawsuit's scope.\n*   **U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California:** The court that issued the ruling against Workday.\n*   **Judge Rita Lin:** Judge who indicated that identifying collective members did not seem insurmountable.\n*   **New York City:** Implemented AI in hiring restrictions in 2022, effective 2023, requiring audits.\n*   **California:** State slated to have AI hiring regulations in effect by 2026.\n*   **Colorado:** State also slated to have AI hiring regulations in effect by 2026.\n*   **LinkedIn:** Private company adding AI tools to assist recruiters in the HR industry.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Workday must provide the list of customers using its HiredScore AI features by August 20.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Workday faces expanded legal scrutiny and customer data disclosure for its AI hiring tools.",

And while the guidance is aimed at federal contractors, grant recipients and others who receive federal funds, management-side attorneys said it\u2019s instructive for all employers.\n\nHR practices under DOJ scrutiny\n\nDOJ took aim at a number of HR practices in its guidance, including hiring.\n\nPolicies that mandate representation violate federal law by creating unequal treatment or disadvantaging otherwise qualified candidates, the agency said, offering the example of a research institute that adopts a policy requiring that all interview slates for faculty positions include a minimum number of candidates from specific racial groups and rejecting otherwise qualified candidates.\n\nLikewise, hiring criteria that \u2014 while neutral on its face \u2014 may function as a proxy for protected characteristics, is illegal, DOJ said. According to the agency, this can include the practice of hiring for \u201ccultural competence\u201d or \u201clived experience,\u201d as well as geographic targeting.\n\nDOJ also cautioned employers against race-segregated training. For example, a university DEI training program that requires participants to separate into race-based groups for discussions and prohibits individuals of other races from participating in specific sessions would be illegal, the agency said.\n\n\u2018Good insight\u2019 for HR\n\nThe agency\u2019s guidance follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on alleged discrimination masquerading as DEI. The president used executive orders to call on agencies to issue guidance and roll back Biden-era DEI initiatives, among other directives.\n\n\u201cThis Department of Justice will not stand by while recipients of federal funds engage in illegal discrimination,\u201d said Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a statement announcing the guidance. \u201cThis guidance will ensure we are serving the American people and not ideological agendas.\u201d\n\nDOJ\u2019s guide follows similar efforts from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which also enforces nondiscrimination laws.

Employers can also view the guidance through the lens of their organizational risk tolerance.\u201d\n\nThe document also may foreshadow similar, but more widely applicable, efforts from EEOC. \u201cWith the EEOC\u2019s quorum likely to be established shortly, further guidance (and other action, such as rescission of guidance) is anticipated,\u201d Shivers said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday released a sweeping guidance document that could impact school district hiring and training practices, as well as the programming available to students.\n\nIn some situations, districts could be exposed to legal liability by asking job applicants how their \"cultural background informs their teaching,\" using recruitment strategies targeting candidates from specific geographic areas or racial backgrounds, and asking job candidates to describe how they overcame obstacles, according to the memo from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.\n\nSuch diversity, equity and inclusion practices could amount to \"illegal discrimination,\u201d said Bondi in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis guidance will ensure we are serving the American people and not ideological agendas.\"\n\nThe DOJ memo contains examples of practices it lists as \u201cunlawful\u201d and says could lead to federal funding being revoked, as well as a list of recommendations, which it says are not mandatory, to avoid \"legal pitfalls.\"\n\nThe guidance issued to all federal agencies also says the following actions could expose federally funded institutions, including school districts,to legal liability based on race, ethnicity or sex-based discrimination:\n\nProviding teacher training that \"all white people are inherently privileged\" or training on \"toxic masculinity.\"\n\nProviding areas, such as lounges, that are primarily meant to provide \"safe spaces\" for traditionally underserved groups.\n\nUsing demographically driven criteria \"to increase participation by specific racial or sex-based groups\" in programs and opportunities.\n\nAsking employees, including teachers, during training sessions to \"confess\" to personal biases or privileges based on a protected characteristic.\n\nInstead, school districts and other federally funded institutions should provide opportunities to all races and sex-based groups without regard to their protected characteristics or demographic goals, instead focusing on \"universally applicable criteria\" such as academic merit or financial hardship, the Justice Department memo said.\n\nThe guidance could impact districts' efforts to make education more equitable, such as by diversifying the teacher pool through Black educator pipelines, training teachers on implicit and explicit biases, and creating academic or enrichment programs to increase engagement from minority student groups.\n\nThe directive is in line with the Trump administration's push to pare back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, including through the U.S. Department of Education. In recent months, the Education Department has increasingly collaborated with the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights laws, often seeking to protect Asian and White students.\n\nThe guidance from the Justice Department illustrates the major shift in how both agencies under President Donald Trump approach enforcement of civil rights laws, with officials now targeting programs that were often launched to fight systemic discrimination.\n\nIn April, the Education Department announced a Title VI investigation into Chicago Public Schools over allegations from the conservative group Defending Education that the district's \"Black Students Success Plan\" implemented in 2023-24 discriminated against students based on race.\n\nIn May, the department announced another Title VI investigation into Fairfax County Public Schools over a 2020 revision to the admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. That policy dropped standardized testing requirements and instead used a holistic review process, which the Education Department said harms Asian American students.\n\nIn 2024-25, the highly selective magnet school was 61% Asian and 21% White, with Black and Hispanic students making up less than 10% of the student population each.\n\nThe guidance from the Trump administration and the Education Department investigations come after concerns from civil rights groups that recent federal policy changes, along with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, would set back educational equity efforts even outside of race-conscious admissions.\n\nScholarship availability, teacher pipelines and student affinity groups were among the top areas beyond college access that advocates were concerned could be impacted in the wake of that ruling.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** DOJ warns school diversity practices risk \"illegal discrimination\" and funding loss.\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. Department of Justice released new guidance Wednesday, warning that certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in schools could constitute \"illegal discrimination.\" This memo, from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, states that practices like asking about cultural background in hiring or providing \"safe spaces\" for underserved groups could lead to legal liability. It also warns of potential federal funding revocation for federally funded institutions. The guidance suggests focusing on \"universally applicable criteria\" such as academic merit instead of demographic goals.\n\n**Why it matters:** This guidance could significantly impact school districts' ongoing efforts to make education more equitable. It challenges practices like diversifying teacher pools through Black educator pipelines and creating academic programs to increase engagement from minority student groups. The information might challenge the current consensus view by targeting programs that were often launched to fight systemic discrimination. It illustrates a major shift in how civil rights laws are enforced.\n\n**The big picture:** This new directive aligns with the Trump administration's broader push to reduce diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including through the U.S. Department of Education. The Education Department has increasingly collaborated with the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights laws, specifically seeking to protect Asian and White students. This guidance illustrates a major shift in how both agencies under President Donald Trump approach civil rights law enforcement. It comes after concerns from civil rights groups that recent federal policy changes and the Supreme Court's 2023 decision would set back educational equity efforts.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   61%: Asian student population at Thomas Jefferson High School in 2024-25.\n*   21%: White student population at Thomas Jefferson High School in 2024-25.\n*   Less than 10%: Black and Hispanic student population each at Thomas Jefferson High School in 2024-25.\n*   2023-24: Academic year when Chicago Public Schools' \"Black Students Success Plan\" was implemented.\n*   2023: Year of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAutumn Adkins Graves is head of school of St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield School, an age 2 through grade 12 independent school in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWe adults have lost our way.\n\nWe need to figure out how to right the ship for our children \u2014 the sooner, the better.\n\nAs an educator and independent school leader, I can speculate about how we got here, but that doesn\u2019t matter as much as how we collectively fix the broken infrastructure.\n\nOne place to start is by teaching students how to be exemplary citizens \u2014 the kind of people who focus on making the world a better place, not just on their own self-interests.\n\nAutumn Adkins Graves Permission granted by Autumn Adkins Graves\n\nOf course, this raises a chicken-egg conundrum. To raise outstanding citizens, do we begin by rethinking how we teach important subjects and lessons? Or is it more important to challenge students to think holistically, apply their lessons in a broader context, and envision a world \u2014 one they can help shape \u2014 beyond the year 2025?\n\nThe answer is both.\n\nThe task is enormous. After all, we have to teach students how to thrive in an ever-changing world, a society that we may not completely understand ourselves.\n\nOn another level, basic civics lessons can \u2014 and should be \u2014 woven more explicitly into curricula.\n\nOn a fundamental level, that means teaching students how to work together in teams \u2014 whether academic, athletic or performing arts.\n\nSelflessness should be in, while selfishness should be on the way out. We\u2019ve become a society of \u201cme,\u201d not \u201cwe.\u201d We are now a country of people who value the highlight dunk reel over passing up a shot for a teammate, and we are indirectly teaching that \u201cme first\u201d mindset to our students.\n\nTrue leadership isn\u2019t always about being in charge or being credited as No. 1. Sometimes, it\u2019s about supporting a team, pushing a shared vision forward, and finding contentment in playing a small but vital role in a team effort.\n\nThere\u2019s real value in contributing to something bigger than oneself, even without the title or limelight. If we can shift that mindset and rethink that paradigm, we\u2019ll be making positive strides.\n\nAt a larger level, it also means educating students about how decisions and laws are established, not just in the three branches of the federal government but also at the state and local levels.\n\nA student needs to realize why it matters to stay abreast of current events and the importance of participating in democracy.\n\nNearly 64% of people voted in the last presidential election, but far fewer voted in off-year or local elections. Yet those are the elections that impact people and communities the most.\n\nMoreover, because so many people avoid voting, too many young people don\u2019t know how the government works in America or feel apathetic to the incremental changes that occur at the local level.\n\nRather than seeing elected officials as public servants, they identify officeholders as political figures or, even worse, career politicians or celebrities \u2014 people who are only interested in making decisions to ensure victory in their reelection campaign rather than determining what is best for their constituents in the short or long run.\n\nAlso, it is time to tweak the way we teach media literacy: Too many students accept TikTok and Instagram posts at face value without considering the source or weighing the credibility of the content creator.\n\nMoreover, schools can empower students to solve issues instead of getting stuck on identifying problems.\n\nToo frequently, we fixate on what\u2019s broken instead of creating a better way. Rather than pointing fingers, shifting the focus can make a difference. When students learn to be solution-makers, not just problem-identifiers, they lower their toxic anxiety levels and instead set themselves up to succeed in tomorrow\u2019s world.\n\nAs educators, shaping students to think like exemplary citizens means adjusting our approaches so we enable students to build confidence in their abilities to apply their understanding in a \"real-world\" context.\n\nThings won\u2019t change today, this month, this year or even this decade. But by beginning with the end in mind \u2014 with a resolve that society can be full of exemplary citizens \u2014 we can start on the right path.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved a bipartisan spending bill for fiscal year 2026 that would prevent the executive branch from removing Title I and special education programs to agencies outside the U.S. Department of Education. The legislation also rejects several other funding reforms proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe bill would require timely awarding of formula grants by the Education Department to states and districts. For several weeks in July, the Education Department and the White House's Office of Management and Budget withheld $6.2 billion in grant funding that states and districts expected access to starting July 1.\n\n\n\nThat funding at pre-approved FY 2025 spending levels was released after the Trump administration conducted a \"programmatic review\" and added \"guardrails\" to ensure the funds would not violate executive orders or administration policy, a senior administration official at OMB told K-12 Dive in an email July 25.\n\nEducators, parents, education organizations, and Republican and Democratic lawmakers had pressured the administration to make the funds available, citing that the disruption in funds was causing school program cuts, canceled contracts and staff layoffs.\n\nIn total, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the Education Department in FY 26 at $79 billion, according to the bill text. That's $12.3 billion more than President Donald Trump's proposal of $66.7 billion. In the current fiscal year, the Education Department is funded at $78.7 billion.\n\n\"The bill also supports families by investing in education and affordable child care, which promotes financial stability for working parents and benefits our economy,\" said Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\n\nThe proposed education budget \u2014 which was included in funding legislation for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and related agencies \u2014 passed the committee in a 26-3 vote.\n\n\"Our bills reject devastating cuts \u2014 and reject many of this administration\u2019s absurd proposals \u2014 like dismantling the Department of Education,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, in her opening remarks.\n\n\"We all know President Trump cannot dismantle the Department of Education or ship education programs to other agencies. Authorizing laws prevent that. Appropriations laws prevent that,\" Murray said.\n\nTrump has said he wants to reduce the size and scope of the federal government and give states and localities more fiscal decision-making authority while reducing bureaucracy.\n\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order to shutter the Education Department to the \"maximum extent appropriate.\" Congress, however, would need to approve the closing of the agency.\n\nMaintaining separate formula grants\n\nThe Trump administration's budget proposed a new K-12 Simplified Funding Program that would merge 18 current competitive formula funding grant programs into one $2 billion formula grant program. The administration said the SFP would spur innovation and give states more spending flexibility and decision-making power.\n\nThe Senate Appropriation Committee instead rejected that plan by keeping the formula grants separate. The Senate plan would provide a $50 million increase over FY 2025 spending for both Title I-A funding for low-income schools and districts, and for special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\nThe bill would maintain current spending levels, except for a few reductions, across other K-12 formula and competitive grant programs targeting improvements in teaching and learning, according to a bill summary from Murray's office.\n\nOther notable spending proposals from the Senate Appropriations Committee FY 26 bill include:\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights would maintain level spending at $140 million.\n\nThe Institute of Education Sciences would be funded at $793 million, level with the FY 25 budget.\n\nTitle I and IDEA would be funded at $18.5 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. The two grant programs make up the largest share of funding for K-12 at the Education Department.\n\nUnder the HHS portion of the legislation, the committee recommends increasing funding for the early childhood learning programs Head Start and the Child Care and Community Block grant by $85 million each to $12.4 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations bill will now be considered by the House and full Senate.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRelationship building is the most important skill Robert Alemany says he brings to his role as director of facilities at The Buckley School, a private K-9 school in New York City.\n\nRobert Alemany Permission granted by The Buckley School, NYC\n\nWith a background in teaching and business management, he had to learn the technical side of facility management from scratch when he shifted to that line of work about five years ago. Yet it\u2019s people management that he relies on most to succeed in his role overseeing a four-building campus of close to 400 students, he says.\n\nAmong his big challenges this year is meeting the energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One of the school\u2019s older buildings needs upgrades if it\u2019s to meet the city\u2019s tough building performance standards. To learn about his career path and how he\u2019s tackling the challenges that come with the job, Facilities Dive sat down with Alemany for a short conversation.\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nFACILITIES DIVE: How did you become involved in facilities management?\n\nROBERT ALEMANY: It was accidental. I started out teaching at public schools in different roles. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher forever and got an MBA. I thought I\u2019d go work in finance, but I kept getting these managerial roles at educational places, then got a job at a church in New York City. The church bought a parking garage, gutted it and turned it into this really contemporary facility. They decided that Monday through Saturday they would rent it out as space and just use it for church on Sundays. They used the income from the event space to pay off the mortgage.\n\nI ran operations there for a while. They had somebody taking care of the building [who departed, then they] said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you step into this role?\u201d I was like, \u201cI really appreciate it, but I don\u2019t know which way to hold a screwdriver, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m your guy.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe appreciate your management skills and the kind of person you are. You can get the skills to excel in this role,\u201d and they gave me a shot. I started cold calling facilities managers in similar roles, getting books and doing online courses and just loved it.\n\nA few years down the line, a position opened up at the school I\u2019m at now and I thought it was a perfect fit; I had these newly acquired facility skills and I\u2019d been a teacher. I know what they experience every day. That led me to where I am now.\n\nTalk about your training.\n\nALEMANY: I continue to build off what I learned and got my real estate license. I still talk to people in the field, invest in books and do online courses whenever I can. You just never stop talking to people. Even when we have vendors come in, I ask, \u201cWhy? What kind of stuff are you doing here?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important skill the job requires?\n\nALEMANY: People management, which is not something that [typically] comes to mind. When people think of facilities, they think of pipes and HVAC systems and all that. But there are people that are involved in maintaining and repairing that equipment. So it\u2019s about building relationships, especially in a city as busy as New York City. To get emergency service here, for example, relationships make a difference. We might not be on the top of the list of a company. We\u2019re just a small fish in the pond. But by building relationships, we become a priority for others. And when you have to negotiate contracts and work through different things, people skills are at the top.\n\nAre there laws or regulations that cause you the most challenge? How do you manage compliance?\n\nALEMANY: Here in New York City, it\u2019s Local Law 97 which is the law that\u2019s governing carbon emissions. One of the buildings was last renovated in 1974. We\u2019re fine for this year, but by 2030 we\u2019re not going to meet the threshold that they\u2019ve set. We\u2019re going to be fined about $35,000 or something like that. So we\u2019re undergoing a renovation project and engaging architects and some engineers to help us with that to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nAs it relates to school buildings, some of it is health department stuff because we\u2019ve got a nurse here. So, it\u2019s making sure that chemical cleaners are away and out of reach of kids. We also face a lot of the regulations that other buildings do, but when they come in and do their inspections, they\u2019re a lot stricter with us because we\u2019re a school.\n\nWhat keeps you up at night?\n\nALEMANY: Just the idea that every facilities manager has: that something weird is going to go wrong, where you forgot if you did something or forgot to talk to someone. The unexpected. But that comes with the role. There\u2019s a level of unpredictability, but it drives you to be as well organized as you can and think through things. Even if something doesn\u2019t happen, you think through multiple steps and say, \u201cOkay, if it did, what would I do? How would I respond?\u201d\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone who\u2019s interested in becoming a facility manager?\n\nALEMANY: Be humble, ask questions and learn from those around you. There are a lot of people that have done this before, and it\u2019s not just facility managers, but those that have worked in the trades that love to share their passion for what they do. Don\u2019t try to re-create the wheel. Absorb knowledge and create friendships and relationships. If anybody would want to pursue the career, I would encourage them to do it, because it really is a great career.\n\nDid you have a unique journey into facilities management? Are you managing through challenges others could benefit from learning about? If you\u2019re interested in sharing your story with others in your field, Facilities Dive would appreciate hearing from you.

        "summary": "**Headline:** NYC School Facilities Director Navigates Local Law 97 Challenges\n\n**Key details:** Robert Alemany, facilities director at The Buckley School, emphasizes people management and relationship building as his most crucial skills. He faces significant challenges meeting energy efficiency goals under New York City\u2019s Local Law 97. One older school building requires upgrades by 2030 to avoid an estimated $35,000 fine. The school is engaging architects and engineers for a renovation project to reduce its carbon footprint. Additionally, they navigate stricter health department regulations common for school buildings.\n\n**Why it matters:** Local Law 97 creates substantial compliance and financial burdens for building operators in New York City, particularly for older structures. This highlights the increasing operational costs and capital expenditures businesses face due to evolving environmental regulations. The article challenges the common view that facilities management is purely technical, stressing that human relationship skills are paramount for success, even for smaller entities like schools. This suggests a potential shift in the required competencies for leadership roles in property management.\n\n**The big picture:** Alemany entered facilities management accidentally, leveraging his background in teaching and business management. He learned the technical aspects on the job and through continuous self-education and networking. His prior experience at a New York City church, which converted a parking garage into a multi-use facility, provided foundational operational skills. He advises aspiring facility managers to be humble, ask questions, and build strong relationships within the industry. The role inherently involves unpredictability and strict regulatory compliance.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Four-building campus of close to 400 students.\n*   One school building was last renovated in 1974.\n*   Potential fine of about $35,000 by 2030 for non-compliance with Local Law 97.\n*   Robert Alemany shifted to facilities work about five years ago.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Robert Alemany:** Director of facilities at The Buckley School, overseeing operations and managing compliance with city regulations.\n*   **The Buckley School:** A private K-9 school in New York City facing challenges with building upgrades and regulatory adherence.\n*   **Facilities Dive:** The publication that conducted an interview with Robert Alemany about his career and current professional challenges.\n*   **New York City:** The municipality where Local Law 97 governs carbon emissions, impacting buildings and facilities managers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Buckley School's ongoing renovation project with architects and engineers to reduce its carbon footprint.\n*   The 2030 deadline for meeting Local Law 97 carbon emission thresholds to avoid financial penalties.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Relationship building is crucial for facilities management amid rising regulatory burdens.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nStaffed Up is a monthly series examining school staffing best practices and solutions for teacher recruitment and retention. Catch up on previous installments here.\n\nThough it\u2019s expected that teacher turnover will decrease over the next few years, it\u2019s estimated that there were at least 49,000 vacant teaching positions and 400,000 underqualified educators instructing in classrooms nationwide during the 2024-25 school year, according to a project led by researchers from the University of Missouri and the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTexas has one of the highest teacher underqualification rates in the country, according to the University of Missouri-University of Pittsburgh research project.\n\nBetween the 2019-20 and 2024-25 school years, the total number of uncertified teachers in Texas jumped from 12,900 to 42,100, the Texas Education Agency found. That means 12% of the state\u2019s total teachers were uncertified by 2024-25 compared to 3.8% before the pandemic.\n\nOn top of that, 34% of the nearly 49,200 newly hired teachers in the 2023-24 school year had no Texas teaching certifications, according to TEA data.\n\nTexas makes a change\n\nTexas\u2019 growing reliance on uncertified teachers stems from the District of Innovation policy enacted by the state legislature in 2015.\n\nSome 986 Texas school districts participate in the program, which essentially automatically allows them to waive teacher certifications even though it was initially intended just for career and technical education teachers, said Jacob Kirksey, an assistant professor of education policy at Texas Tech University. Kirksey is also the associate director of the university\u2019s Center for Innovative Research in Change, Leadership and Education.\n\nSince the pandemic, however, there has been a \u201cdramatic spike\u201d in districts using the District of Innovation program to help with hiring uncertified teachers for foundational subject areas, Kirksey said.\n\nAccording to Kirksey\u2019s research, Texas\u2019 use of uncertified teachers with no classroom experience led to major learning losses for students. Those taught by new uncertified educators lost 4 months in reading and 3 months in math compared to their peers taught by certified instructors.\n\nBut a major shift is underway: HB2, a new state law enacted in June, will phase out all uncertified teachers in foundational content areas by the 2029-30 school year.\n\nNow in Texas, Kirksey said, \u201cwe've seen the extent of the damage. I think our legislature realized, \u2018OK, we created this hole, and now we need to put in the work to fix it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHB2 also incentivizes districts to hire high-quality teachers, he said. Under the new law, districts can receive $1,000 bonuses for every teacher they certify who previously lacked necessary credentials. Other larger bonuses can be earned from the state for mentoring and training teachers.\n\nSouth Carolina embraces uncertified teachers\n\nOn the flip side, some states are implementing laws that would allow more uncertified teachers to enter classrooms.\n\nIn South Carolina, for instance, a law enacted in May launched a five-year pilot program that will allow public school districts to hire uncertified teachers \u2014 capped at 10% of a district\u2019s instructional staff.\n\nThese teachers must have a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree with at least five years of relevant work experience in the subject area they are hired to instruct. Uncertified teachers must also enroll in an educator preparation program within their first three years of instruction.\n\nThe new law comes as South Carolina\u2019s school districts reported over 1,000 teacher vacancies at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year \u2014 600 fewer vacancies, or a 35% decrease, from the previous year, according to a November 2024 analysis by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement.\n\nDena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association, said she\u2019s concerned that the law doesn\u2019t require uncertified teachers to take any foundational training before they can instruct students. \u201cThe business world and the education world are not the same,\u201d she said.\n\nUncertified teachers also don\u2019t have any incentive to stay in schools and won\u2019t face any consequences if they quit in the middle of their contract, Crews said. For instance, if one of these teachers doesn\u2019t know anything about classroom management and they can\u2019t get students\u2019 attention for days on end, they may not want to come back and teach.\n\n\u201cSo those kids are left at a deficit,\u201d Crews said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t help with the shortage. It helped with the shortage for a couple of days and really didn\u2019t do anything, because those kids didn\u2019t learn anything.\u201d\n\nOverall, Crews said she hopes South Carolina\u2019s uncertified teacher pilot program \u201cwill not become the norm\u201d for states and school districts nationwide.\n\nTexas has watched its uncertified teacher policies play out longer than other states, Kirksey said. Some lessons learned from watching this trend, he said, are that states facing educator shortages should avoid the easiest option, which is to \u201cderegulate everything\u201d for teaching regulations like in South Carolina. Instead, states should look for ways to prioritize training people to become high-quality educators.\n\n\u201cI do think it's just a matter of time before folks realize that if we choose to de-incentivize quality, then it's going to impact kids,\u201d Kirksey said.\n\nKirksey said he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a lack of qualified adults who can teach. Rather, there\u2019s \u201ca lack of educators who are willing to be in the classroom, who are well-prepared.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why states and districts ultimately need to address issues with teacher pay, burnout and job satisfaction, Kirksey said. In Texas, he said, \u201cI feel like, as a state, we finally recognize that.\u201d",

This new law incentivizes districts to hire high-quality teachers through bonuses for certification, mentoring, and training. Conversely, South Carolina launched a five-year pilot program in May to allow public school districts to hire uncertified teachers, capped at 10% of staff. These teachers must hold specific degrees and experience, and enroll in an educator preparation program.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nTexas's reversal via HB2 indicates a legislative recognition of \"the extent of the damage\" caused by widespread reliance on uncertified teachers, specifically \"major learning losses for students.\" This directly challenges the consensus view, exemplified by South Carolina's new law, that allowing more uncertified teachers is a sustainable solution for teacher shortages. Experts warn against the \"easiest option\" of deregulation, noting its potential to \"de-incentivize quality\" and impact kids. The divergent approaches highlight a fundamental debate on education quality versus staffing expediency.\n\n**The big picture:**\nNationwide, an estimated 49,000 teaching positions were vacant and 400,000 educators were underqualified in 2024-25. Texas's growing reliance on uncertified teachers originated from its 2015 District of Innovation policy, which allowed districts to waive teacher certifications. This program saw a \"dramatic spike\" in use for foundational subjects post-pandemic, leading to a jump in uncertified teachers from 12,900 to 42,100 by 2024-25. Meanwhile, South Carolina schools reported over 1,000 teacher vacancies at the start of the 2024-25 school year, providing context for their new policy.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **49,000:** Estimated vacant teaching positions nationwide for 2024-25.\n*   **42,100:** Uncertified teachers in Texas by 2024-25, up from 12,900 in 2019-20.\n*   **12%:** Proportion of Texas teachers uncertified by 2024-25, compared to 3.8% pre-pandemic.\n*   **4 months:** Learning loss in reading for students taught by new uncertified educators in Texas.\n*   **10%:** Cap on uncertified instructional staff under South Carolina's new pilot program.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **University of Missouri & University of Pittsburgh:** Researchers who estimated national vacant and underqualified teaching positions for 2024-25.\n*   **Texas Education Agency (TEA):** Found a dramatic increase in uncertified teachers in Texas schools since 2019-20.\n*   **Jacob Kirksey:** Texas Tech professor whose research linked uncertified teachers to major student learning losses.\n*   **Dena Crews:** President of the South Carolina Education Association, concerned about uncertified teachers' lack of training.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nTexas reverses uncertified teacher policy after learning loss; South Carolina embraces similar unproven path.",

Average scores in reading dropped even further than the underwhelming results released in 2022.\n\nThe Education Department's call for states to seek waivers comes after \"parents have shown a desire for change when it comes to their children\u2019s education\" over the last five years, Sanon said. As a result, states have sought to expand school choice, overhaul literacy instruction based on the science of reading, and supported alternative school models like microschools and hybrid homeschooling, she added.\n\n\"These actions, combined with the 2024 NAEP results, show that the education sector is at an inflection point,\" Sanon told states.\n\nStates respond to calls for flexibility\n\nPresident Donald Trump, both as candidate and as president, has strongly pushed to give states more control over education spending and programming.\n\nTrump's crusade has thus far peaked with cutting the Education Department nearly in half and issuance of an executive order in March to close the agency \u201cto the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\u201d Full closure requires congressional approval.\n\nThe White House has also pushed for education block grants, which could potentially remove guaranteed funding for certain programs in favor of state flexibility to spend dollars as they see fit.\n\nPublic education and civil rights advocates have argued this could shortchange the students most in need of grant funding, while giving states room to pursue other priorities like school choice.\n\nHowever, Republican states have responded positively to the administration's plans.\n\nEven prior to McMahon's confirmation, 12 state chiefs wrote her on Jan. 28 urging her to issue state waivers and allow block grants once confirmed.\n\nJust days after Trump's executive order on winding down the Education Department, Republican state leaders echoed that call in letters to the department seeking more spending leeway.\n\nIndiana, whose state chief was among those to write McMahon in January, has already pitched a plan for its waiver, giving a glimpse into what states might seek.\n\nLast week, the Indiana Department of Education said in a statement it was \"pursuing a new opportunity to reduce federal red tape and increase state-level control over how federal education funds are used.\"\n\nThe department said its waiver request, which is in the public feedback stage, was inspired by and seeks to replicate the flexibilities the state experienced when spending federal pandemic aid under the Emergency Elementary and Secondary Education Emergency Relief fund.\n\nCurrently, the state said, it is spending \"a disproportionate share of time and resources\" on federal mandates like financial accounting, auditing, fiscal reporting and program monitoring.\n\nIndiana is seeking flexibility from programs including, but not limited to, state assessments, education of migrant children, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk youth, English Language Acquisition instruction, and academic enrichment programs.\n\nThe state said it would instead focus its dollars on literacy, STEM and high school redesign initiatives.",

For example, Ortiz recommends the \"four corners\u201d exercise, where each corner of the room or area is designated as \"agree,\" \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d \u201cdisagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly disagree.\" The teacher then makes different statements, and students move to the corner of the room that represents their opinion on each statement.\n\nThis activity gets students out of their seats and introduces content in an engaging way, as it provides space for their opinions and encourages interaction with peers.\n\nOrtiz also uses music to bring joy into the classroom. She recommends creating a classroom \\playlist where every student can contribute a song that helps them focus. Then, during independent work time, educators can play the playlist in the background.\n\nThis helps foster a sense of community in the classroom and makes them more motivated during independent work time, because they have contributed to the environment.\n\nDuring testing and midterm season, Ortiz ensures that there are wellness spaces available for her students. This involves setting aside the first 15 minutes of class for students to partner in a relaxing and fun activity, which she provides, such as crossword or word search puzzles, origami and coloring books. This creates a space where students laugh, talk and connect, she said, so that when it's time to wrap up, they are ready for learning.\n\nHolbert also emphasized that motivation ebbs and flows for students just as it does for adults.\n\n\u201cI think it's OK if sometimes kids aren't motivated or sometimes kids aren't feeling joyful. I think the systems that we find ourselves embedded in and existing in are sometimes really unpleasant,\u201d said Holbert. \u201cThe kids aren't broken, it\u2019s systems that are.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he emphasizes the importance of taking a holistic approach to thinking about how to build schools and communities to be places that value young people and care for their well-being, not just their academic achievement.",

A national survey from Nemours Children\u2019s Health found that over 80% of early elementary teachers are concerned about their students' literacy skills, with many respondents saying they don't feel prepared to tackle the reading crisis.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn an effort to improve the reading proficiency of New York's students, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a 'Back to Basics' reading plan in January 2024. The goal is to make sure students across all districts learn foundational reading skills through new and improved curriculum grounded in the science of reading.\n\nThe plan specifies that all school districts must certify that their curriculum, teaching methods and training align with evidence-based instruction to the New York State Department of Education by September 2025.\n\nAccording to the SUNY New Paltz report, 69% of schools and districts have either adopted or are piloting curriculum aligned with science of reading instructional practices.\n\nMost educators reported they are \u201cvery familiar\u201d or \u201cfamiliar\u201d \u2014 46% and 38% respectively \u2014 with the science of reading. However, only 8% of respondents stated that they received prior instruction on science of reading informed teaching practices in their educator preparation program.\n\nDespite this, teachers are working hard to gain more understanding of the topic: 75% reported being \u201cvery interested\u201d and 21% were \u201csomewhat interested\u201d in learning more about the science of reading. Most educators also said in the report that they primarily seek learning opportunities to \u201cunderstand how to teach reading more effectively\u201d and to \u201cmeet [their] students\u2019 varying needs for reading.\u201d\n\nTo implement the science of reading practices, teachers require focused and thorough professional development, the report said. This professional learning, however, needs to go beyond teaching new curriculum and ensure that educators learn about certain practices like how to screen and assess student skills, determine specific needs and select proven instructional materials.\n\nWhile 45% of educators reported learning about the science of reading from their schools and districts, many are seeking additional information from outside sources such as books, journals or magazines. Others are talking with friends and colleagues or learning from local colleges or universities.\n\nRose Else-Mitchell, executive director of the Science of Reading Center, said administrators have the power to implement an aligned system and connect educators with evidence-based curricula, as well as assessments that support and complement it. The report also recommends that school leaders rethink and expand professional learning and work on creating a strong professional learning community.\n\nAlthough the survey was sent to educators and administrators, respondents were mainly educators. The Science of Reading Center plans to establish this as an annual survey, and it will also release a slightly different administrator-specific survey next year, said Else-Mitchell.\n\n\u201cIt'll be interesting to be able to look at this year over year and see what kind of changes, because we know that nothing in education is ever a flick of a switch,\u201d she said. \u201cBut something as significant as this, which is sort of re-establishing a shared understanding and a shared evidence base for how to teach reading, will take time as it becomes more systematized.\u201d",

This plan aims to ensure students learn foundational reading skills through new curriculum based on the \"science of reading.\" All New York school districts must certify their curriculum and methods align with this evidence-based instruction by September 2025.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 90% of New York educators support \"science of reading\" instruction.\n*   Only 8% of educators received prior instruction in science of reading in preparation programs.\n*   69% of schools and districts have adopted or are piloting aligned curriculum.\n*   75% of educators are \"very interested\" in learning more about the topic.\n*   Over 80% of early elementary teachers are concerned about student literacy skills nationally.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Science of Reading Center at State University of New York New Paltz:** Conducted a new survey on educator support and training for \"science of reading.\"\n*   **Gov. Kathy Hochul:** Announced New York's 'Back to Basics' reading plan in January 2024 to improve student reading.\n*   **Nemours Children\u2019s Health:** Conducted a national survey finding over 80% of teachers concerned about literacy skills.\n*   **New York State Department of Education:** Districts must certify curriculum alignment with evidence-based instruction to this department.\n*   **Rose Else-Mitchell:** Executive director of the Science of Reading Center, plans annual surveys and administrator-specific surveys.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Science of Reading Center plans annual educator surveys and an administrator-specific survey next year.\n*   All New York school districts must certify curriculum alignment by September 2025.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew York's reading reforms face training hurdles despite educator support and state mandates.",

Views are the authors\u2019 own.\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act governs calls and text messages sent by businesses to consumers. One such rule is that businesses must obtain express written consent prior to sending text messages to consumers, if they are using an automated telephone dialing system or making calls using an artificial or pre-recorded voice, including the use of AI bots.\n\nThe TCPA also provides that businesses may not call or text consumers on the federal Do Not Call List unless prior express consent is given. Even basic telemarketing calls and text messages require prior express consent. Violation of the statute can trigger liability for up to $1,500 per call or text message sent.\n\nAdditionally, many states have their own version of the TCPA, deemed \u201cmini-TCPAs,\u201d that require compliance for all businesses who make calls to consumer-residents in that state, regardless of where the business is domiciled.\n\nLead generation\n\nMany companies use lead generators which gather consumer consents for multiple businesses and then provide the companies with consent and contact information for those potential consumers. Lead generators who obtain proper written consent can be a very useful tool for companies. This was generally permissible under the TCPA.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Federal Communications Commission updated its TCPA rules requiring \u201cone-to-one consent\u201d which was to become effective Jan. 27, 2025.\n\nThe one-to-one consent rule provides that if a business uses an ATDS, artificial or prerecorded voice, the business must obtain prior express consent, one seller at a time.\n\nThus, it prevents lead generators from using a single consumer\u2019s consent for multiple businesses. Additionally, the one-to-one consent rule provides that the consent must be clear and conspicuous, and the calls and texts initiated pursuant to the consent must be logically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent. This rule applies to both text messages and phone calls.\n\nOrder delayed\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2025, the FCC postponed the 2023 order by a year, until Jan. 26, 2026. Later that same day the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the 2023 Order, thus eliminating the one-to-one consent rule.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the FCC exceeded its statutory authority under the TCPA because the 2023 Order\u2019s new consent restrictions impermissibly conflict[ed] with the ordinary statutory meaning of prior express consent.\u201d\n\nNotably, the court ruled that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority at the outset, when it created the one-to-one consent rule. The court held that the 2023 Order\u2019s one-to-one prior express consent restriction impermissibly conflicted with the ordinary statutory meaning of \u201cprior express consent.\u201d Thus, the Court vacated application of the 2023 Order, and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nAs a result, it is very likely that we will see other cases challenging TCPA regulations, especially as to the consent required before making a telemarketing call or text message using an ATDS.\n\nAbundance of caution\n\nIt is unclear whether the FCC will revise its 2023 Order to comply with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision. In order to be prepared for this rule to come into effect, and in an abundance of caution, businesses who use lead generators to source potential consumers\u2019 consent should ascertain that the lead generators are obtaining individual, one-to-one consent.\n\nBusinesses should also only contact consumers who provide this consent for telemarketing that is logically and topically associated with that which the consent was provided. Further, in addition to storing consumer contact information, businesses must retain the consent forms, information as to when consent was given, and through whom. Even businesses that do not use lead generators to obtain consent should continue to review their consent practices to ensure strict compliance with the TCPA and mini-TCPAs.\n\nThe TCPA requires prior express consent, and in many cases, prior express written consent, for calls and text messages made to prospective consumers. Regardless of any changes to the TCPA, the FTSA still requires that businesses obtain prior express written consent when making unsolicited telephone calls (including sending text messages) using an automated system. And lastly, to further protect your business, the consent form should have robust terms of service, including a class action waiver.\n\nWe continue to recommend that businesses ensure compliance with the TCPA, FTSA, and any other state regulations by always obtaining express written consent prior to contacting potential consumers via calls or text messages.",

        "summary": "**FCC's One-to-One Telemarketing Consent Rule Vacated by Appeals Court**\n\n**Key details:**\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 2023 Order, which established a \"one-to-one consent\" rule for telemarketing. This rule would have mandated specific, individual consent for each seller when businesses used automated dialing systems or pre-recorded voices. The court determined the FCC exceeded its statutory authority, stating the new consent restrictions conflicted with the ordinary meaning of \"prior express consent.\" Consequently, the one-to-one consent rule, originally set for Jan. 27, 2025 (then postponed to Jan. 26, 2026), is now eliminated.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe FCC's one-to-one consent rule was set to significantly restrict how lead generators could provide consumer consent to multiple businesses. The court's decision to vacate this rule removes an impending and substantial compliance burden on companies utilizing lead generation for telemarketing efforts. This challenges the prior consensus that businesses would need to overhaul their consent acquisition strategies and potentially face higher marketing costs, impacting sales outreach.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) governs how businesses can call and text consumers, generally requiring express written consent for automated systems. Violation of the TCPA can result in significant penalties, and many states have similar \"mini-TCPAs.\" Companies widely use lead generators to gather consumer consents, a practice historically permissible under the TCPA. The FCC's 2023 Order aimed to alter this by requiring more granular, one-to-one consent, which has now been overturned.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Up to $1,500 per call or text message: Potential liability for TCPA violations.\n*   Jan. 27, 2025: Original effective date for the FCC's 2023 one-to-one consent order.\n*   Jan. 24, 2025: Date the FCC postponed the order by one year.\n*   Jan. 26, 2026: Postponed effective date, which is now void after the court's ruling.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Federal Communications Commission (FCC):** Updated TCPA rules in 2023, postponed its order, and was found by the court to have exceeded its statutory authority.\n*   **Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals:** Vacated the FCC's 2023 Order, ruling the FCC exceeded its authority under the TCPA.\n*   **Senosiain (associate at Gunster):** Author of the views expressed in the article.\n*   **Rollins (shareholder at Gunster):** Author of the views expressed in the article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   It is unclear whether the FCC will revise its 2023 Order to comply with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision.\n*   It is very likely other cases challenging TCPA regulations will emerge, particularly regarding consent for telemarketing calls/texts using automated systems.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nKey telemarketing consent rule vacated, but regulatory uncertainty persists for businesses.",

The group of Democratic officials said it believed it was \u201ccritical to rebut [the prior letter\u2019s] assertions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the SEC and DOL to uphold their commitment to protecting the ability of fiduciaries to exercise their professional judgment in assessing long-term financial risks,\u201d the Feb. 19 letter said. \u201cEfforts to politicize investment management and restrict fiduciary discretion threaten the financial security of millions of retirees.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Democratic finance officials took particular issue with the Republican officials\u2019 letter relying heavily on a federal judge\u2019s ruling against American Airlines in a lawsuit over the management of its retirement plans. The Republican finance officials used U.S. District Court judge Reed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling as evidence that the incorporation of factors like ESG is being used to pursue non-pecuniary goals.\n\nThe officials included state auditors, treasurers, controllers and comptrollers from New York City, California, Illinois and 12 other states who said that such a characterization of the use of environmental, social and governance factors is \u201cincorrect and dangerously misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision in Spence v. American Airlines, which dismissed long-term financial interests as a \u2018mere pretext,\u2019 fails to reflect the fundamental reality of long-term investing,\u201d the Democratic officials wrote. \u201cFiduciaries are not speculators \u2014 they are stewards of trillions of dollars in assets that must sustain retirees for decades.\u201d\n\nOfficials from Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also signed onto the letter. They said that risks related to climate change, governance failures and systemic issues are \u201cpresent-day financial realities affecting market valuations, insurance costs, supply chains and infrastructure resilience.\"\n\nThe Republican officials had said in their Jan. 28 letter that they held \u201cserious concerns\u201d that funds were being used to advance ESG or DEI goals and asked for rulemaking to prohibit plans from using assets to \u201cadvance political or social goals.\u201d They also asked the Labor Department and SEC to issue comprehensive guidance explicitly saying that making investment decisions or proxy votes based on ESG or diversity, equity and inclusion objectives is \u201cinconsistent with fiduciary duties.\u201d\n\nConnecticut State Treasurer Erick Russell called the request a \u201cdangerous political proposal\u201d in emailed comments to ESG Dive Wednesday, while Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs went a step further, calling the approach \u201cOrwellian\u201d and \u201ca reckless attempt to put politics ahead of sound financial decision-making\u201d in comments Wednesday.\n\n\u201cForbidding investment managers from assessing real-world risks \u2014 whether they stem from supply chain disruptions, environmental instability, shifting consumer demand, or any other factor \u2014 would restrict their ability to fully analyze investment opportunities and inherently runs counter to that fiduciary responsibility,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe blue state fiduciaries warned that if utilizing ESG factors in investment decisions was banned for fiduciaries, it could cause weaker investment performance, create greater exposure to market volatility and increase financial vulnerability for retirees.\n\n\u201cAs stewards of public funds, we have a responsibility to ensure that our investments provide stable, long-term returns over periods of decades,\u201d Delaware State Treasurer Colleen Davis told ESG Dive. \u201cIt is morally reprehensible and financially negligent to play politics with the American people\u2019s retirement savings and investments.\u201d\n\nActing SEC Chair Mark Uyeda and Acting Labor Secretary Vince Micone are currently in charge of two agencies who are defending a pair of ESG-linked regulations in court. Uyeda said last week he would seek a delay in arguments in lawsuits about the SEC\u2019s climate-risk disclosure rule, indicating the agency as constructed is not inclined to defend the rule. A federal judge recently ruled in favor of the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department on its regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral benefits in the case of a tiebreaker.

That amount is about 52% of the $12 million in economic development grant funding Pactiv received in 2014 from the state\u2019s Department of Commerce, which included an agreement to keep the site open and retain at least 800 jobs through Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nPactiv also agreed to drop its legal attempts to get refunds for its 2023 and 2024 property tax payments, which could have resulted in the company receiving $4.5 million. Plus, Pactiv will not bill the city of Canton for any wastewater treatment services it provided from 1964 through last month, when it sold the shuttered mill to demolition and environmental remediation company Spirtas Worldwide.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe paper mill in Canton had been in operation for more than 100 years prior to then-owner Pactiv shutting it down in 2023, according to the state of North Carolina. Blue Ridge Paper Products operated the facility since 1999, and in 2007 that company became Evergreen Packaging through a merger. Pactiv Evergreen formed in 2020 through the combination of Evergreen Packaging and Pactiv, both of which were previously acquired by Reynolds Group Holdings.\n\nAt the time of the Canton mill\u2019s closure, many people expressed surprise at Pactiv Evergreen\u2019s decision. The company made the announcement in March 2023 along with other closure and restructuring disclosures, and CEO Mike King noted a \u201cchallenging market environment\u201d for Pactiv\u2019s beverage merchandising business. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement last week that the Canton closure came as a \u201cgut punch\" to the local and state economies.\n\nUpon introducing the lawsuit in May 2024, then-Attorney General Josh Stein noted that taxpayers \u201cinvested in Pactiv Evergreen to bolster our state\u2019s economy,\u201d but Pactiv didn\u2019t hold up its end of the bargain. He said at the time that his office had tried working with Pactiv for a year to address the company\u2019s obligations, but it had \u201cbecome clear that legal action was necessary to hold Pactiv accountable.\u201d The initial lawsuit sought repayment of the full $12 million in economic incentives that Pactiv had received.\n\nThe settlement should not be viewed as an admission to wrongdoing, according to the North Carolina Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cPactiv broke its promise to the state and the people of Canton, and today\u2019s settlement holds it accountable for violating its agreement,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who was elected in November and took office last month, said of the new settlement. \u201cThis settlement will allow the people of Canton and Haywood County to immediately put millions back into rebuilding their economy after the mill\u2019s closure, and it will shield them from future litigation from Pactiv.\u201d\n\nThe candidates for state attorney general repeatedly brought up the mill issues on the campaign trail prior to November\u2019s election. Both candidates expressed a desire to hold Pactiv accountable.\n\nPactiv had filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in July 2024. But a judge denied that motion in October, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have resolved with the State of North Carolina all outstanding matters relating to the closure and sale of our former Canton mill site. We thank our employees for their contributions to our company and wish the Canton community well in this next chapter for the Town,\u201d said Pactiv Evergreen Tuesday in an emailed statement.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Pactiv\u2019s first legal battle over the Canton site.\n\nIn autumn 2023, the company reached a settlement worth more than $2 million with the U.S. EPA over Clean Air Act violations at Canton. Earlier that year, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality said the site violated water quality requirements; the company denied the allegations. In 2021 and 2022, the mill faced state air quality violations.\n\nNovolex is in the process of acquiring Pactiv Evergreen for $6.7 billion.

The $6.25 million payment aims to assist Canton and Haywood County in rebuilding their economies following the mill's closure, which was described as a \"gut punch.\" While the initial lawsuit sought the full $12 million in incentives, the agreed-upon $6.25 million settlement may indicate a less severe financial outcome for Pactiv than initially demanded by the state. This outcome could challenge an investor's prior expectation of a larger financial penalty for the company stemming from the contractual breach.\n\n**The big picture:** The Canton paper mill, operational for over 100 years, was shut down by Pactiv Evergreen in May 2023, a decision that surprised many. Pactiv Evergreen, formed in 2020, cited a \"challenging market environment\" for its beverage merchandising business as a reason for the closure. North Carolina sued the company in May 2024, asserting Pactiv did not meet its obligations under a 2014 economic development grant.

It also prohibits agencies from taking legal positions that differ from those of Trump or Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nThe order applies to the Fed as it relates to \u201cconduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions,\u201d but the Fed board and the Federal Open Market Committee would maintain independence over monetary policy.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAgencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission \u2013 which Congress established as independent from the White House \u2013 would also be affected by the order.\n\nThe carve-out for the Fed on monetary policy \u201cseems directed toward preventing a negative market reaction to the order,\u201d said Jeff Naimon, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at law firm Orrick.\n\nThe agencies also have to employ a White House liaison, and consult regularly on policy and priorities with the OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council and the White House National Economic Council, according to the order. The OMB will \u201cadjust so-called independent agencies\u2019 apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely,\u201d according to a fact sheet that accompanied the executive order.\n\n\u201cThese regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,\u201d the order said. \u201cMoreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\u201d\n\nThe move to expand Trump\u2019s authority is the latest by an administration that\u2019s sought to concentrate power under the executive branch. It also reflects the influence of Vought, one of the architects of conservative blueprint Project 2025, and broadens his supervisory powers. In addition to leading OMB, Vought also is acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u201cFor the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people\u2019s elected President,\u201d the order continued.\n\nNaimon noted there was strong coordination between independent agencies and the White House during Trump\u2019s prior administration, but the executive order would now require that coordination.\n\nLegal challenges to the order are \u201calmost certain,\u201d Kathryn Judge, a Columbia University professor of law, said in an email.\n\nThe outcome of any litigation is less clear, however, since the judiciary has embraced a more unitary view of the executive branch and a more expansive view of executive authority, she added.\n\nThe order \u201crepresents the largest single assertion over executive power over the administrative state that I can recall, not only in my lifetime but through history,\u201d Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said in an email. \u201cSome aspects of this control represent departures from long-standing norms. Others are in apparent contravention of statute and will be challenged legally.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much of the modern independent regulatory system survives the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts at consolidation is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d Conti-Brown said, noting that the Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed skepticism of independent agencies. SCOTUS did, however, uphold the funding structure of the CFPB.\n\nBanks may welcome the development in the near term, since the Trump administration is widely expected to usher in an era of reduced regulatory burden. But \u201cthose shifts would be far less enduring than if implemented in other ways,\u201d Judge said.\n\n\u201cLonger term, the result may be a whipsaw in regulatory and supervisory expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will make it harder for banks to make operational and other decisions that are core to their business.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump expands executive power over agencies, impacting financial regulation.\n\n**Key details:**\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order expanding his authority over independent agencies like the Federal Reserve. The order mandates \"significant\" regulations be reviewed by an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unit led by Russ Vought. It grants Vought power over agency budgets and prohibits agencies from differing on legal positions from the President or Attorney General. While the Fed's monetary policy remains independent, its supervision and regulation of financial institutions are affected. Agencies must also employ a White House liaison and consult regularly with White House councils.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis order represents the \"largest single assertion of executive power\" over the administrative state, according to one expert. It could lead to a \"whipsaw in regulatory and supervisory expectations\" for banks longer term, making operational decisions harder. While banks may welcome near-term reduced regulatory burden, these shifts may be less enduring than if implemented otherwise. The order directly challenges the long-standing norm of independent agencies' autonomy by asserting presidential control over regulatory functions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThis executive order is the latest move by an administration seeking to concentrate power under the executive branch. It reflects the influence of Russ Vought, an architect of Project 2025, broadening his supervisory powers. The administration argues these regulatory agencies currently lack sufficient accountability to the President. The order aims to ensure officials wielding executive power are supervised and controlled by the elected President. While coordination previously existed, this executive order now mandates it.\n\n**By the numbers:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed executive order expanding his authority over independent agencies including the Federal Reserve.\n*   **Russ Vought:** Leads OMB unit reviewing regulations; granted power over independent agencies' budgets.\n*   **Pam Bondi:** Attorney General whose legal positions agencies are forbidden from differing from.\n*   **Jeff Naimon:** Attorney noted Fed's monetary policy carve-out prevents negative market reaction.\n*   **Kathryn Judge:** Professor who predicts \"almost certain\" legal challenges to the executive order.\n*   **Peter Conti-Brown:** Professor calls order the \"largest single assertion\" of executive power.\n*   **Federal Reserve (The Fed):** Independent agency impacted by order regarding financial institution supervision and regulation.\n*   **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** Independent agency established by Congress, now affected by the executive order.\n*   **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC):** Independent agency established by Congress, now affected by the executive order.\n*   **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** Independent agency established by Congress, now affected by the executive order.\n*   **Office of Management and Budget (OMB):** Contains unit reviewing agencies' regulations and adjusts their apportionments.\n*   **White House Domestic Policy Council:** Independent agencies are now required to consult regularly on policy and priorities.\n*   **White House National Economic Council:** Independent agencies are now required to consult regularly on policy and priorities.\n*   **Project 2025:** Conservative blueprint for which Russ Vought is noted as an architect.\n*   **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** Russ Vought is currently acting director of this agency.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Legal challenges to the executive order are \"almost certain.\"\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nExecutive order expands Trump's power over agencies, inviting litigation.",

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nA federal judge ruled that the Labor Department\u2019s regulation allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG and other collateral factors as a tiebreaker does not violate the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to court documents.\n\nTexas Northern District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled in favor Friday of a Biden administration agency motion for summary judgment and found that the agency\u2019s guidance is still valid under the Loper Bright ruling issued last year, which overturned that judicial standard of deferring to agencies\u2019 interpretations of ambiguous statutes in laws .\n\nKacsmaryk initially dismissed the lawsuit brought by a number of Republican-led states in September 2023 in a ruling relying on the now-overturned Chevron doctrine . The case was heard on appeal after Chevron\u2019s demise and sent back to Kacsmaryk to determine whether the rule could stand in a post-Chevron world.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Labor Department rule in question, \u201cPrudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,\u201d was finalized in 2022 and has been in effect since January 2023. The rule was designed to overturn guidance the agency issued in 2020 under the first Trump administration that forbade fiduciaries from utilizing \u201cnon-pecuniary\u201d factors in investment decisions.\n\nThe 2022 rule was designed to overturn a \u201cchilling effect\u201d that the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department said was witnessed under the 2020 rule. The guidance revised the agency\u2019s tiebreaker standard to allow for consideration of collateral benefits like ESG in the event that two or more investments would equally serve the plan\u2019s best interests but it would be imprudent to invest in both or all options.\n\nThe DOL rule has been repeatedly challenged by a coalition of 26 Republican-led states, who argued it runs afoul of ERISA and exceeded the agency\u2019s statutory authority. However, Kacsmaryk disagreed in his Feb. 14 ruling and said such a reading of the law \u201cembodies the wooden textualism that courts should endeavor to avoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the rule, a fiduciary faced with choosing between investment options \u2014 that all equally serve the beneficiaries' financial interests \u2014 does not advance the interests of nonbeneficiaries nor act for a purpose other than their financial benefit when he chooses based on collateral factors,\u201d the judge ruled. \u201cPlaintiffs' interpretation of ERISA would demand arbitrary randomness to choose between such investment options.\u201d\n\nThe Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo case \u2014 which determined the fate of the Chevron doctrine \u2014 was decided in the time between Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial dismissal of the case and when the plaintiffs and the Biden administration\u2019s Labor Department argued before the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June 2024 overturned the Chevron doctrine, which previously directed courts to give agencies deference in their interpretations of ambiguous law statutes.\n\nWhile the parties had opposing views on how Chevron\u2019s demise affected the case at hand, the Fifth Circuit refused to rule on the case, but vacated the initial dismissal and asked Kacsmaryk whether the rule can be squared with ERISA or the Administrative Procedure Act in light of Loper Bright.\n\nKacsmaryk said Loper Bright \u201cdid not disturb how courts evaluate a rule under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard,\u201d in his ruling Friday. He said the overturn of the Chevron doctrine should change how courts should interpret statutes, but not how they review the reasonableness of agency decisions.\n\nThe judge said that the tiebreaker standard in the 2022 rule does not violate ERISA\u2019s duty of loyalty nor its requirement that fiduciaries act \u201csolely\u201d and for the \u201cexclusive\u201d benefit of the plan\u2019s financial interests. Kacsmaryk said ERISA defines \u201cwhose interest the fiduciary must protect\u201d and what their purpose is, but \u201csays nothing of what they may consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as a driver, duty-bound to choose the fastest route to his destination, may choose the most scenic of two routes that each bring him to his destination at the same time, so too can a fiduciary choose a preferable investment option between two that will equally satisfy his duty of loyalty,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThe coalition of Republican-led states were also joined in their lawsuit by public oilfield services company Liberty Energy, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright served as CEO at the time. The plaintiffs have previously signaled a willingness to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, but first it will return to the Fifth Circuit panel that initially heard the arguments.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration\u2019s Labor Department will handle the case. Experts have previously expressed concerns about the DOL\u2019s rule being one of the Biden administration\u2019s ESG-related regulations likely to be put on the chopping block under Trump.",

Further, she asserted, it would make the CFPB\u2019s Consumer Response database \u201cunavailable and/or unreliable, severely hamper \u2014 if not entirely take down \u2014 the Bureau\u2019s website, and likely result in the loss of mandatory public reporting the Bureau has previously done.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s order may represent a relief to CFPB employees, but it doesn\u2019t apply to bureau employees who have already been terminated. The agency last Tuesday terminated roughly 70 probationary employees, then Thursday fired another 70 to 100 term employees \u2013 those whose contracts have set limits between one and four years.\n\nAltogether, last week\u2019s firings cut roughly 10% of the CFPB's workforce, according to American Banker.\n\nThe CFPB was not the only banking regulator to see workforce reductions last week. Roughly 500 employees at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or about 8% of its workforce, accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration, Bloomberg Law reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the agency.\n\nThe FDIC then terminated probationary employees, the outlet reported Monday, though the number of employees affected remained unclear.\n\nAn FDIC spokesperson on Friday did not detail how deeply certain units of the regulator were affected.\n\n\u2018Fait accompli\u2019\n\nA lawyer representing the CFPB workers\u2019 union laid out the urgency of Friday\u2019s court action.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m asking that they don't fire the entire agency tonight,\u201d Deepak Gupta, a founding principal at Gupta Wessler, told the court, according to American Banker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the courthouse without some assurance that the mass layoff is not going to happen and then become a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 union asked Thursday for a temporary restraining order to stop the firings, but agreed to seek a preliminary injunction instead.\n\nThat mirrors a case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in which the city of Baltimore sued the CFPB, claiming Vought\u2019s move to return the agency\u2019s funding to the Fed would effectively shut down the bureau \u201cby fiat.\u201d\n\nThe government agreed Thursday that Vought would refrain from transferring money out of the CFPB\u2019s reserve fund or returning money to the Fed or Treasury until Feb. 28, or upon a \u201ccontrary order\u201d from the court, Bloomberg Law reported.\n\nStill, in the workers\u2019 union case, Brad Rosenberg, a Justice Department special counsel, objected to the request for a preliminary injunction.\n\n\"We don't think any preliminary relief is appropriate at this stage because we don't think the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits,\" he said, according to American Banker.\n\nAmong the employees the CFPB terminated Thursday is Julia Barnard, who served as the agency\u2019s student loan ombudsman since last February. Her position is mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\u201cThis work matters,\u201d Barnard said in a statement issued by the Student Borrower Protection Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for borrowers and a safeguard against a system that too often fails them. Dismantling this function is unconscionable and will cost real people real money.\u201d\n\nDelaying any further moves to slash the CFPB workforce would at least give employees time to plan and budget for their personal futures. Employees of the agency are entitled by law to 60 days\u2019 notice of job loss. But last week\u2019s firings came with no notice and with immediate effect.\n\nFurther, terminations for cause (probationary employees, for example, were notified that they were deemed \u201cnot fit for continued employment because [their] ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs\u201d) left those employees without access to severance, one lawyer with the CFPB told ABC News.\n\nIn Vought\u2019s first week as the CFPB\u2019s acting director, the bureau\u2019s headquarters were closed to employees, who were ordered to stop all bureau work. A tip line was also set up for people to report on employees who might be conducting work.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Judge Halts CFPB Firings, Data Deletion Amid Workforce Cuts.\n\n**Key details:**\nKey details: A federal judge has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and its acting director, Russ Vought, not to terminate any employees except for cause until March 3. The judge also mandated that the CFPB not delete or impair any agency data or records. Additionally, the CFPB and Vought are forbidden from transferring money from the bureau's reserve funds other than for ordinary operating obligations. Despite the order, the CFPB placed all employees on administrative leave except those asked to return.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhy it matters: The potential loss of 12 years of agency data, including supervisory and enforcement records, could impair the Bureau's ability to identify risks and respond to threats. This could destabilize markets, allow bad actors to exploit weaknesses, and undermine public trust in the financial system. It also risks market manipulation and could give tech companies like X Money an illegal competitive advantage by accessing sensitive data. This challenges the consensus view of a well-regulated and stable financial market by explicitly detailing the potential for instability and unfair practices if the Bureau's functions are compromised.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe big picture: The court order followed an urgent plea from the National Treasury Employees Union to block a \"mass firing\" it believed would affect 95% of the CFPB workforce. A former CFPB chief technologist warned that critical databases, including consumer complaints and financial institution records, were at risk of being \"irretrievably lost.\" Last week, the CFPB had already cut roughly 10% of its workforce, terminating approximately 70 probationary and 70-100 term employees without prior notice. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) also saw workforce reductions, with 500 employees accepting deferred resignation offers from the Trump administration.\n\n**By the numbers:**\nBy the numbers:\n*   March 3: Date of the next court hearing in the case.\n*   95%: Estimated percentage of the CFPB workforce the union feared would be affected by mass firings.\n*   12 years: Worth of information held in agency databases at risk of deletion.\n*   10%: Roughly the percentage of the CFPB's workforce cut by firings last week.\n*   500: Number of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. employees who accepted a deferred resignation offer.\n\n**Key Players:**\nKey Players:\n*   **CFPB:** Federal agency facing court orders regarding employee actions, data, and fund transfers.\n*   **Russ Vought:** Acting director of the CFPB, ordered by a judge not to terminate employees or transfer funds.\n*   **Judge Amy Berman Jackson:** Federal judge who issued the orders to the CFPB and its acting director.\n*   **National Treasury Employees Union:** Urged the judge to block a potential mass firing at the CFPB.\n*   **Erie Meyer:** Former CFPB chief technologist, filed a declaration warning the court about data deletion risks.\n*   **X Money:** Payments tool set for launch this year, could gain illegal competitive advantage if data is lost.\n*   **Visa:** Card network partnering with social media platform X for the launch of X Money.\n*   **X:** Social media platform owned by Elon Musk, partnering with Visa on X Money.\n*   **Elon Musk:** Owner of X, seen as architect behind the Department of Government Efficiency, which infiltrated the CFPB.\n*   **Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC):** Banking regulator that also experienced workforce reductions last week.\n*   **Julia Barnard:** CFPB's student loan ombudsman, terminated last Thursday, a position mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nLooking Forward:\n*   The next court hearing in the case is scheduled for March 3.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe Bottom Line: Judicial orders curb CFPB actions, aiming to protect data and market stability.",

        "summary_text": "The politicians, provocateurs and think tanks that in the past few years have worked to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion may not appreciate the full consequences of their efforts.\n\nThey\u2019ve used a variety of tactics, in the public and private sectors, including White House executive orders; lawsuits or the threat of lawsuits; shareholder proposals; and needling on social media. They\u2019ve notched high-profile wins, most notably the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling against affirmative action and capitulation at several companies, including retailers and brands that have ended or scaled back their DEI programs.\n\nThe successful challenges, inevitably, are forcing scrutiny of DEI practices. But they also provide an opportunity to reinforce DEI goals and execution, which David Glasgow, executive director of New York University\u2019s Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, sees as a silver lining.\n\nIndeed, the victories are hardly universal. Because diversity, equity and inclusion are good for business for a variety of reasons, most companies are not abandoning DEI. So far in 2025, Target, Nike and Costco are among those that have defended at least some aspects of their policies (in Costco\u2019s case, vociferously). As the Heritage Foundation, a major DEI foe, noted in November, most Fortune 500 companies continue to publicly commit to DEI.\n\n\u201cIt is a time for companies to refine and strengthen their inclusion efforts in ways that reduce the risk in the short term \u2014 because the risk is real, and we know that \u2014 and in ways that are sustainable in the long term,\u201d said Adrienne Pulido, vice president of inclusion insights at Kantar. \u201cSo it is looking at both ends of the spectrum, in terms of being very clear about what inclusion means to their business.\u201d\n\nWhat DEI is and isn\u2019t\n\nDEI is being pilloried as discriminatory and unfair, yet these systems are designed to create a business that is neither. That is, a business where employees have a variety of backgrounds and perspectives (diversity); hiring, promotion and other actions are executed fairly (equity); and the culture is comfortable and inviting to all who work there (inclusion).\n\n\u201cUnpacking what DEI is and what inclusion is, is part of this moment we're in and part of the conversation that companies need to have about their strategies,\u201d Pulido said by video conference. \u201cWhat does DEI mean to the business itself? What does it mean to the business and to the future business? Because the demographics of the country are changing, and our research shows that inclusion as a concept, as an idea, is very popular among Americans of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\nDEI goals for most companies are more important than ever because the markets for their products and services are more diverse than they were a decade or more ago, according to Effenus Henderson, who has worked in recruiting, staffing and succession planning at companies in the U.S. and abroad since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThis attack is amplified through the use of social media and technology and psychometrics, where emotions get aroused and reinforced,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cBut fundamental to all this is that DEI is not about creating systems that are discriminatory, or about quotas, or a focus on one thing at the exclusion of others. I don't think organizations have really done that. What they have been doing is really trying to expand participation because of the growing demographic change that we're seeing.\u201d\n\nThe need to develop DEI strategies that fit with and further business strategies dictates the involvement of leadership, according to Henderson. Too often, though, they are left to the human resources department, leaving companies at risk of adopting DEI programming that is ineffective and possibly indefensible.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are able to navigate this generally are the ones where leadership has spent the time talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about reacting to the George Floyd situation or to civil rights laws or litigation. It's really, \u2018How do we integrate this as a part of the DNA of who we are as an organization?\u2019 If your organization is more performative, then they don't really understand how it helps to shape business strategy and policy.\u201d\n\nDEI should be treated like any other strategic priority, according to Tim Heneveld, country director for Pergolux in North America. With DEI under the spotlight, it\u2019s a good moment to reassess whether hiring, workplace environment, leadership and operational strategies fit with broader aims.\n\n\u201cThat means setting measurable goals, using data to track impact, and holding leadership accountable,\u201d Heneveld said by email. \u201cSome organizations are feeling pressure to scale back DEI, but I think doing so would be shortsighted. Instead, companies should refine their DEI strategies, aligning them with long-term business goals rather than reacting to what they are seeing in the media or any other outside factors. I've experienced, firsthand, workplaces can attract top talent, strengthen their teams, and improve retention.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, companies are continuing with their DEI efforts, but changing the names of their initiatives or titles of their employees, experts said.\n\nCrafting DEI initiatives and training is always a work in progress because businesses, markets and demographics evolve, according to Henderson. For many companies, that may mean avoiding those three letters of the alphabet, or the words \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d But that, too, requires some thought, he said.\n\n\u201cIs continuing to refer to it under those banners still appropriate, and if I look at renaming it, am I doing that to help enhance our appeal to the markets of the customers and employees we serve? Are we doing it as a reactive, defensive thing for a short-term issue that's hot and heavy right now?\u201d he said. \u201cGet clarity around your objectives, the alignment with your strategies, and then decide whether how you are framing it today will work for you tomorrow and the day after. At some companies, it may mean one thing, and to others it may mean something else.\u201d\n\nThe legal concerns\n\nThe list of lawsuits against DEI programs tracked by the Meltzer Center is long, and getting longer.\n\nMost of these claims invoke civil rights laws intended to end or prevent unfair hiring practices or contracts. Frequently that includes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, barring discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin; Section 1981 of the federal code barring discrimination in contracts; and the U.S. Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, according to Glasgow. The Meltzer Center advises companies to avoid DEI practices that give preference to members of certain groups and involve a tangible benefit.\n\nEvaluating whether a company\u2019s DEI programs run afoul of the latest interpretations of these codes entails enlisting attorneys or other compliance experts.\n\n\u201cThis has become a thriving legal practice area,\u201d Glasgow said.\n\nAny business strategy should always be grounded in risk mitigation, and this is just another place for companies to check, according to Henderson. Companies may learn that, to avoid risk, certain aspects of their DEI programs should change.\n\nOthers may find that they pass muster. In its proxy statement urging shareholders to vote against a proposal that could have weakened its DEI programs, Costco\u2019s board of directors made clear that the retailer regularly evaluates its \u201cpractices concerning compliance with law, including evolving Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nIn describing how Costco obeys the law and does not discriminate in hiring, promotion and other practices, the board also provided a litany of protected statuses. This is a reminder that, while civil rights statutes are being leveraged to overturn DEI practices, they nevertheless do bar discrimination for a host of reasons. Moreover, any company that does business abroad will encounter antidiscrimination law that isn\u2019t being disrupted by political activism the way it is in the U.S., Henderson said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Canada, Europe, Asia and South America, there are regulations and laws that support and value diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo backing away from DEI may, in fact, create harm for your business strategies in other parts of the world. It's not a simple answer, and it just depends on who you are.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem like DEI programs are quickly getting scrapped in order to avoid controversy, most are simply under review, Glasgow and others said.\n\n\u201cI think it's prompting a much deeper reflection within companies, not just on what is strictly legal or illegal in what we're doing, but on what has been working and what has not been working,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cCould we be doing this work more effectively, in a way that actually helps us achieve our business goals, or helps us create the kind of culture that we want to create? Are there things that have been low impact, or maybe even have a negative impact, that we should get rid of, even if it's not for legal reasons? I think the moment that we're living in now could be a helpful reset moment for the field.\u201d",

        "summary_text": "Acting Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mark Uyeda\u2019s decision last week to ask the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay arguments for the agency\u2019s climate risk disclosure rule did not come as a surprise to regulatory experts in the space.\n\nWhile the change is expected to have minimal immediate impact, it sets the stage for a shift in focus for the SEC under the Trump administration.\n\nThe SEC issued its long-awaited climate-risk disclosure rule last March, nearly two years after it was first proposed \u2014 and amid over 24,000 public comments. Uyeda was one of two commissioners to vote against the rule\u2019s approval. The rule was immediately met with multiple lawsuits that were later consolidated into the Eighth Circuit. The spate of legal challenges led the agency to stay the rule\u2019s implementation in April.\n\nGiven the agency\u2019s stay and the change in administration, Tom Willman, regulatory lead for artificial intelligence sustainability platform Clarity AI, said Uyeda\u2019s decision came \u201cas no great surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nevertheless disappointing that investors will be deprived of much-needed financially material information related to climate related risks,\u201d Willman said by email Wednesday.\n\nJulie Gorte, senior vice president of sustainable investing at Impax Asset Management was more blunt in an interview: \u201cThe only person on the planet who didn't see this coming was Rip Van Winkle,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\nUyeda\u2019s recommended pullback on defending the SEC climate rule follows his prior critiques of the rule. During the hearing on the final climate rule, in the weeks after it was finalized and in his Feb. 11 statement announcing the delay request, Uyeda maintained his belief that the SEC does not have the authority to promulgate the rule or require such disclosures.\n\nJenner & Block Partner Jennifer Lee, a former assistant director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said Uyeda\u2019s position is \u201cconsistent with the new, Republican-led SEC\u2019s shift back to focusing on \u2018bread and butter\u2019 investor disclosure issues.\u201d Lee, who now represents companies and financial institutions in regulatory investigations and litigation, told ESG Dive in emailed comments Thursday that she expects that focus to include an emphasis on materiality, while looking to avoid \u201coverly prescriptive disclosure requirements for public companies.\u201d\n\nThe change in SEC posture, however, is expected to have a minimal impact for companies or investors, according to Willman and Gorte.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this is going to be extraordinarily minimal, partly because it was never enforced in the first place,\u201d Gorte said Wednesday. \u201cSo we never had better climate reporting stimulated by U.S. regulatory postures to begin with. And for U.S. companies, or for any company really, a lot of the big ones are probably still going to have to be reporting on all the same things that were in that rule because of [other jurisdictions].\u201d\n\nWillman echoed that note and said that many U.S. companies already voluntarily report climate risks due to investor demand, in addition to growing regulatory requirements both overseas in jurisdictions like the European Union, and stateside in California. New York recently reintroduced its own version of California\u2019s climate disclosure laws.\n\nAdditionally, Stephen O\u2019Day, a partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, noted the intervenors in the case could continue the rule\u2019s defense, even though the SEC\u2019s announcement indicates this iteration of the agency is not inclined to defend the rules. In the case of the climate rule, 18 states and the District of Columbia have signed on as intervenors to support the agency\u2019s rule.\n\nO\u2019Day said a similar process happened after intervenors continued the defense for enforcement actions taken by the Clinton-era administration for violations of the Clean Air Act by coal-fired plants. Ultimately, the intervenors prevailed, and the Supreme Court upheld the actions.\n\n\u201cThe proceedings pending in the Eighth Circuit involve challenges filed by multiple parties and intervenors, any of which could seek to continue defense of the SEC rules,\u201d O\u2019Day said. \u201cSo, while the court may grant the requested 45-day pause, it remains to be seen whether any such pause will result in the end of the SEC\u2019s final rules.\u201d\n\nRegardless, sustainability programs and disclosures are expected to continue.\n\n\u201cRegulatory shifts don\u2019t change the fundamental reality: physical climate risk is already priced into markets,\u201d Lukky Ahmed, CEO of climate risk data and analytics platform Climate X, said by email Wednesday. Firms have a fiduciary responsibility to continue to assess, manage and disclose climate risks to their operations, Ahmed said.\n\n\u201cIntegrating climate resilience and adaptation strategies isn\u2019t just prudent \u2014 it\u2019s essential for maintaining business performance, driving shareholder returns, and protecting communities,\" Ahmed said.\n\nDespite the shifting federal policy stance, \u201cthere is a lot of faith that the drivers of sustainability remain in place no matter who is in anyone's White House,\u201d Gorte told ESG Dive.\n\n\u201cIf we don't solve the climate crisis, there are going to be \u2026 parts of the globe that are probably uninhabitable, or where people can't work outdoors in the summer. If we don't solve the biodiversity crisis, the prospects are even worse.\u201d Gorte said. \u201cSo there are things that we have to do in order to preserve what we think of as life as we know it, and those drivers are going to remain in place.\u201d",

This challenges a view that the SEC's withdrawal would significantly alter corporate reporting.

Acting Chair Uyeda was one of two commissioners who voted against the rule's approval from the outset.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Nearly two years:** Time since the climate-risk disclosure rule was first proposed.\n*   **Over 24,000:** Public comments received on the proposed rule.\n*   **Last March:** When the SEC issued its climate-risk disclosure rule.\n*   **April:** When the agency stayed the rule\u2019s implementation.\n*   **18 states and the District of Columbia:** Have signed on as intervenors to support the SEC's climate rule.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Mark Uyeda:** Acting SEC Chair who requested a delay in court arguments for the climate risk disclosure rule.\n*   **Tom Willman:** Regulatory lead for Clarity AI, who stated Uyeda\u2019s decision was \u201cno great surprise\u201d but disappointing.\n*   **Julie Gorte:** Senior vice president at Impax Asset Management, who said the decision\u2019s impact will be \u201cextraordinarily minimal.\u201d\n*   **Jennifer Lee:** Partner at Jenner & Block, who views Uyeda\u2019s position as consistent with a Republican-led SEC shift.\n*   **Stephen O\u2019Day:** Partner at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, who noted intervenors could continue defending the rule.\n*   **Lukky Ahmed:** CEO of Climate X, who asserted that regulatory shifts don\u2019t change the reality of climate risk.\n*   **Clarity AI:** AI sustainability platform whose regulatory lead provided commentary on the SEC's decision.\n*   **Impax Asset Management:** Firm whose senior vice president highlighted the minimal expected impact of the SEC's action.\n*   **Jenner & Block:** Law firm whose partner provided insight into the SEC\u2019s potential new focus.\n*   **Smith, Gambrell & Russell:** Law firm whose partner commented on the potential for intervenors to continue the defense.\n*   **Climate X:** Climate risk data and analytics platform whose CEO discussed the ongoing importance of climate risk assessment.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals may grant the requested 45-day pause.\n*   Whether such a pause will result in the end of the SEC\u2019s final rules remains to be seen, as intervenors could continue their defense.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nSEC delays climate rule, but market drivers for disclosure remain strong.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nChipmaker Qualcomm saw its fiscal third quarter revenue grow 10% to $10.4 billion over last year, driven in part by expansions into emerging markets, such as artificial intelligence-backed personal computers and smart glasses.\n\nto $10.4 billion The San Diego-based company reported 23% growth in its automotive and internet-connected segments, accounting for nearly $2.7 billion in revenue, as well as ongoing strength in chipset sales for smartphones. Net income grew 25% to $2.7 billion in the quarter versus last year.\n\nQualcomm is also making progress with its expansion into data center chips following its agreement last month to buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion . During an earnings call July 30 , CEO Cristiano Amon said he is already in talks with potential customers and expects to see data center revenues by fiscal year 2028.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nQualcomm, a maker of Snapdragon processors used in smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices, has been focused on diversifying its products to better accommodate the AI boom and reduce its reliance on the smartphone market.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s acquisition of Alphawave Semi, set to close in calendar year Q1 2026, aligns with that strategy, Amon said. It would provide Qualcomm with Alphawave\u2019s intellectual property and data center design capabilities, bolstering the chipmaker\u2019s high-speed wire connectivity and compute silicon solutions.\n\n\u201cWhile we are in the early stages of this expansion, we are engaged with multiple potential customers and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler,\u201d Amon said. In May, Qualcomm signed a memorandum of understanding with Humain to develop AI data centers in Saudi Arabia. It has also made its Oryon processors compatible with Nvidia technology for data center applications.\n\nIn addition to meeting data center demand, it\u2019s betting on smart glasses and wearable technology to reshape the consumer electronics landscape. As AI continues to advance, Amon said these devices are transitioning beyond simply extensions of smartphones into new and unique experiences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about the trends we see in this area with major AI players, application developers and device makers investing in this space,\u201d Amon said.\n\nQualcomm is already a major chipset supplier for Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which recently expanded into Oakley and Ray-Ban styles. It also has a partnership with China\u2019s Xiaomi, which launched its AI glasses in the quarter.\n\nBeyond wearables, Qualcomm is also seeing traction with its automotive business, driven by its digital chassis solutions, as well as industrial demand, Amon said.\n\nThe chipmaker has been taking steps to prepare for when Apple, one of its largest customers, stops buying its products altogether. Apple debuted its first modem chip with the launch of its iPhone 16e in February. In a disclosure to investors, Qualcomm said it expects Apple to increasingly use its own modem products, which could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on its earnings moving forward.\n\nDespite lower activity from Apple, Amon said the company expects handset revenues to grow 5% from Q3 to Q4.\n\nDuring the three months that ended June 29, Qualcomm saw the vast majority of its revenue come from the sale of chips and hardware. Approximately $6.3 billion stemmed from processors and chips for mobile handsets. Meanwhile, $984 million came from the company\u2019s growing automotive segment and $1.7 billion from its smart devices unit, which includes products sold for PCs, tablets, smart glasses and augmented reality headsets.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s licensing business generated nearly $1.5 billion in revenue.\n\nLooking ahead, the chipmaker is forecasting Q4 revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion.\n\nDuring the call, analysts questioned whether Qualcomm\u2019s growth in the quarter came in part from pull-in sales related to China amid tariff uncertainty.\n\nAmon assured them that \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing any evidence of pull-in,\u201d attributing the upside to early orders ahead of its new chip product launch in September.",

The automotive and internet-connected segments showed significant strength, growing 23% to nearly $2.7 billion in revenue. The chipmaker is expanding into data center chips, having agreed to buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion, and is in talks with potential data center customers.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nQualcomm is actively diversifying beyond the smartphone market to accommodate the AI boom, which could reshape its revenue streams. The company's acquisition of Alphawave Semi and advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler signal a strong commitment to the data center segment. Crucially, despite Apple's move to increasingly use its own modems, Qualcomm expects handset revenues to grow 5% from Q3 to Q4, which challenges the immediate consensus of a significant negative impact on this core business.\n\n**The big picture:**\nQualcomm, historically known for Snapdragon processors in mobile devices, is strategically shifting to reduce reliance on the smartphone market. This diversification includes significant investments in AI-backed PCs, smart glasses, and the automotive sector. The company is preparing for Apple, a major customer, to cease buying its products by expanding into new growth areas.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Fiscal Q3 revenue: $10.4 billion (10% growth year-over-year)\n*   Net income: $2.7 billion (25% growth year-over-year)\n*   Automotive and internet-connected segments revenue: Nearly $2.7 billion (23% growth)\n*   Alphawave Semi acquisition cost: $2.4 billion\n*   Q4 revenue forecast: $10.3 billion to $11.1 billion\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Qualcomm:** Chipmaker reporting strong Q3 results and actively diversifying its product portfolio.\n*   **Cristiano Amon:** Qualcomm CEO, leading the company's diversification strategy into new markets like AI and data centers.\n*   **Alphawave Semi:** Company Qualcomm agreed to acquire for $2.4 billion to boost its data center capabilities.\n*   **Humain:** Partnered with Qualcomm to develop AI data centers in Saudi Arabia.\n*   **Nvidia:** Qualcomm's Oryon processors are compatible with Nvidia technology for data center applications.\n*   **Meta:** Uses Qualcomm as a major chipset supplier for its smart glasses, including Ray-Ban styles.\n*   **Xiaomi:** Chinese company that launched its AI glasses in the quarter, partnering with Qualcomm.\n*   **Apple:** Major Qualcomm customer, expected to increasingly use its own modem chips, potentially impacting Qualcomm's earnings.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Qualcomm's new chip product launch is expected in September.\n*   The company forecasts Q4 revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nQualcomm's growth is driven by diversification into AI, auto, and data centers.",

Wells Fargo has denied that allegation.\n\nThe labor board wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union despite the vote, based on a 2023 precedent case. The 2023 Cemex ruling strengthened the NLRB's power to compel companies that violate labor laws to recognize unions.\n\nHowever, Republicans and business groups oppose the precedent. The acting general counsel of NLRB, William Cowen, or his permanent replacement, could withdraw, amend, or settle the Wells Fargo complaint.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Cowen acting general counsel this month, days after firing NLRB\u2019s previous chief lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo, a Biden appointee, and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox.\n\nThe email notifying Wilcox of her termination said she was being fired since she did not \u201cshare the objectives\u201d of the present administration. Wilcox\u2019s ouster has left the board with only two members coupled with existing vacancies and does not meet the minimum number of members needed to adjudicate routine cases.\n\nWilcox is suing Trump, alleging the president surpassed his authority in firing her and requesting that she be allowed to resume her work as an NLRB member.\n\nThe NLRB complaint does not signify a complete investigation or a full adjudication of the allegations; rather, the regional office found that the allegations may be sufficient to go to a hearing to consider all evidence and make credibility determinations, a Wells Fargo spokesperson noted.\n\nEmployees at the Atwater branch voted 3-1 to reject unionization in January 2024. The branch manager allegedly told staff she knew about organizing discussions and warned about camera surveillance. She also reportedly told workers that Wells Fargo would apply stricter work conditions and would make union supporters stay longer hours.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank trains its managers to respect the rights of its employees to freely associate and join or support a union, or to bargain collectively with a representative of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWe train our managers to comply with labor law and respect the rights of our employees,\u201d the spokesperson told Banking Dive via email. \u201cIn this case, the majority of eligible employees freely voted against a union in a Board supervised secret ballot election and the facts do not support allegations to the contrary.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo is cooperating with the investigation but believes these allegations are unfounded and plans to defend the company and employees, the spokesperson added.\n\nAn NLRB hearing before a judge is scheduled for October, and Wells Fargo, if ordered to collectively bargain, can appeal to NLRB members in Washington, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRecently, unionized Wells Fargo employees hit a new challenge in organizing. The bank's conduct management intake team won its union vote 21-16 in December, making it the first non-branch unit at Wells Fargo to unionize.\n\nThe team, which handles customer and employee complaints across various locations, has now filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB through Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA. The complaint alleges that the bank illegally refuses to engage in collective bargaining following the certified union vote, American Banker reported. However, the bank contends it\u2019s waiting for the outcome of the NLRB\u2019s review and claims there were procedural flaws in the handling of the vote.\n\nCWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year, with around 200 employees being organized.\n\nWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf pushed back on employee unionization efforts last April, saying it\u2019s important to \u201cmake clear that we continue to believe that our employees are best served by working directly with Wells Fargo and our leadership team.\u201d",

Most employees at the Atwater branch, despite signing union cards, later voted against unionization. The NLRB wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union, citing the 2023 Cemex precedent. Wells Fargo denies the allegations, stating employees freely voted against unionization and the bank is cooperating. Separately, Wells Fargo\u2019s recently unionized conduct management team also filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging the bank refuses to bargain.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis matters because the NLRB's use of the Cemex precedent could compel Wells Fargo to bargain with a union, challenging the bank's assertion that employees freely rejected unionization. This could create a new, forced path for labor organizing within financial institutions, potentially impacting Wells Fargo's operational flexibility and labor costs. The recent firings and appointments within NLRB leadership, alongside a lawsuit against President Trump, add a layer of political uncertainty to the complaint's outcome. These developments highlight a growing push for unionization within the banking sector, challenging the traditional non-union status quo.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe NLRB's complaint follows a strengthening of its power through the 2023 Cemex ruling, which allows it to compel union recognition after labor law violations; this precedent is opposed by Republicans and business groups. Recent leadership changes at the NLRB include President Trump appointing William Cowen as acting general counsel after firing Biden appointee Jennifer Abruzzo and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox. Wilcox is suing Trump, alleging overreach, and her ouster has left the NLRB with insufficient members to adjudicate routine cases.

However, cars and auto parts that would be subject to the tariff on copper will instead be covered by the Trump administration\u2019s previous 25% automotive duties.\n\nThe order also calls for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to establish a process to consider additional derivative copper goods within the next 90 days. Additionally, the U.S. plans to work with the United Kingdom to negotiate an approach to the trade of copper, per a framework agreement between the two countries.\n\nTrump made the decision to install the copper levies after receiving the results of a Section 232 investigation from the Commerce Secretary on June 30. Similar Section 232 investigations have served as precursors to U.S. tariffs, such as the 50% duties currently being levied on steel imports. The report stated that the U.S. is \u201coverly reliant\u201d on copper imports, posing a national security risk and necessitating action such as tariffs, according to the order.\n\nAs part of the report, the Commerce Secretary recommended the implementation of additional tariffs to be phased in through 2028, including a 15% tariff on refined copper starting in 2027 and 30% starting in 2028. The order also asks the Commerce Secretary to deliver a report on the state of the domestic copper industry that can help assess whether the additional tariffs on refined copper are needed.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary also recommended the implementation of a 25% domestic sales requirement for copper inputs and scrap, as well as export controls. The order charges the Commerce Secretary with taking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to install the domestic sales requirement, although it remains unclear when such a provision would be enacted.\n\nTrump first announced plans to levy a 50% tariff on copper imports in a Truth Social post earlier this month.

This new duty takes effect on August 1 and stacks on other applicable tariffs, though cars and auto parts are covered by previous automotive duties. The Commerce Secretary is tasked with establishing a process for additional derivative copper goods within 90 days and delivering a report on the domestic industry. Additional tariffs on refined copper are recommended to be phased in through 2028, along with a 25% domestic sales requirement for copper inputs and scrap.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters as the tariffs aim to address a national security risk due to the U.S. being \"overly reliant\" on copper imports. This challenges any prevailing view that current import levels are sustainable or without strategic risk to the nation. The tariffs, stemming from a Section 232 investigation, indicate a significant shift towards domestic protectionism in a vital commodity sector. It suggests a move away from reliance on foreign supply chains toward bolstering domestic copper production and sales.\n\n**The big picture:** President Trump made the decision after receiving results of a Section 232 investigation from the Commerce Secretary on June 30. The report concluded that heavy reliance on copper imports poses a national security risk. Similar Section 232 investigations have previously led to U.S. tariffs, such as the 50% duties on steel imports. Trump had previously announced plans for the 50% copper tariff on Truth Social earlier this month.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **50%:** Tariff rate on copper imports starting Aug. 1.\n*   **Aug. 1:** Effective date for the new copper tariffs.\n*   **90 days:** Timeframe for Commerce Secretary to establish a process for additional derivative copper goods.\n*   **$10 billion+:** Combined value of copper exports from Chile and Canada to the U.S. last year.\n*   **25%:** Recommended domestic sales requirement for copper inputs and scrap.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed executive order to install a 50% tariff on copper imports.\n*   **Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick:** Received Section 232 results and is tasked with implementing tariff processes.\n*   **United Kingdom:** Plans to negotiate a copper trade approach with the U.S.\n*   **Chile:** Was a top exporter of copper to the U.S. last year.\n*   **Canada:** Was a top exporter of copper to the U.S. last year.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to establish a process to consider additional derivative copper goods within the next 90 days.\n*   Commerce Secretary to deliver a report on the state of the domestic copper industry.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** U.S. tariffs reshape copper trade to boost national security and domestic industry.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump Announces New South Korea Trade Deal, Lower Tariffs\n\n**Key details:**\nKey details: The U.S. has struck a \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" with South Korea, according to President Donald Trump. Under this proposed agreement, the U.S. would charge a 15% tariff on South Korean imports, while U.S. goods entering Korea would not face any tariffs. South Korea has also agreed to be \"completely OPEN TO TRADE\" with the U.S., accepting American products like cars, trucks, and agriculture. Furthermore, South Korea plans to provide $350 million in investments to the U.S., with Trump overseeing their implementation. The deal also includes South Korea buying $100 billion of energy products and investing an additional undisclosed \"large sum of money.\"\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWhy it matters: This newly announced deal marks a significant shift from President Trump's earlier public proposal for a 25% U.S. tariff on South Korean imports starting August 1. The lower 15% tariff on South Korean goods could reduce import costs for U.S. businesses and consumers. Reciprocal zero tariffs on U.S. exports to South Korea could open new market opportunities for American companies, particularly in automotive and agriculture sectors. South Korea's pledged investments and energy purchases could provide a substantial economic boost to the U.S. economy. This outcome potentially challenges a prior market consensus expecting higher tariffs and more restrictive trade with South Korea.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe big picture: President Donald Trump announced this trade development via a Truth Social post on Wednesday. This new agreement follows a prior letter Trump shared on X, which stated a 25% tariff would be imposed on imports from South Korea. The U.S. imported $132 billion worth of goods from South Korea in 2024, and exported $66 billion to the country last year. South Korea accounts for 3.7% of U.S. trade, according to U.S. International Trade Commission data. This deal is part of a series of trade agreements Trump has reportedly reached with several trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, within the last 10 days.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   15%: Proposed U.S. tariff on imports from South Korea.\n*   $350 million: South Korean investments planned for the U.S.\n*   $100 billion: South Korea's planned energy product purchases from the U.S.\n*   $132 billion: Value of U.S. imports from South Korea in 2024.\n*   3.7%: South Korea's share of total U.S. trade.\n\n**Key Players:**\nKey Players:\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Announced a \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" between the U.S. and South Korea.\n*   **South Korea President Lee Jae Myung:** Will visit the White House for a bilateral meeting in the next two weeks.\n*   **U.S. International Trade Commission:** Provided data on U.S. trade with South Korea.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nLooking Forward:\n*   South Korea President Lee Jae Myung is expected to visit the White House for a bilateral meeting within the next two weeks.\n*   An additional, undisclosed \"large sum of money\" investment from South Korea will be revealed during this upcoming meeting.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe Bottom Line: New U.S.-South Korea trade deal indicates lower tariffs and increased South Korean investment.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBoeing continues to recover as the company\u2019s second quarter revenue surged approximately 35% year-over-year to roughly $22.7 billion, reflecting higher commercial plane delivery volume, according to an earnings release Tuesday.\n\nNet losses for the quarter dropped nearly 58% to $612 million, compared to $1.4 billion YoY. Additionally, the plane manufacturer has rebounded financially in the first half of the year, with revenue for the first six months increasing 26.4% to $42.3 billion compared to the same period last year.\n\nCommercial plane deliveries from H1 have also surpassed distribution numbers YoY. Boeing delivered 280 aircraft, making it the most deliveries in Q2 and the first six months of the year since 2018, President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said during an earnings call Tuesday. The company delivered 194 commercial planes in the second quarter and 378 commercial units in the first six months of 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear our recovery plan is taking hold,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re making steady progress to stabilize our business, strengthen development program execution and change our culture to set up for the future.\u201d\n\nStabilizing to increase commercial plane production\n\nEarlier this month, the National Transportation Safety Board released its final report, which found that the plane maker failed to provide \u201cadequate training, guidance and oversight\u201d to its factory workers, leading to the mid-exit door plug on Alaska Airlines that blew out midair on Jan. 5, 2024.\n\nThe incident led the Federal Aviation Administration to cap Boeing\u2019s 737 production at 38 planes a month. Since last year\u2019s Alaska Airlines incident, Boeing has spent billions of dollars to fix its production woes and the company is seeing the benefits of its ongoing investments in stabilizing its production system, Ortberg said. The company has been using key product indicators to measure the stability of its production system, which are part of Boeing\u2019s safety and quality improvement plan it submitted to the FAA last year. The manufacturer progressively increased 737 production over the past year, finally reaching 38 units per month in Q2.\n\nOrtberg highlighted Boeing\u2019s recent actions to improve its processes, including reducing traveled work by 50% and addressing employee feedback from its safety and quality standdowns, the CEO added. Additionally, Boeing engaged in structured on-the-job training as well as \u201csimplified\u201d 1,500 work instruction documents. Moreover, the company aims to shut down its shadow factory in Q3.\n\nThe plane manufacturer has also implemented KPIs for its other commercial aircraft in an effort to stabilize operations and increase production rates. The KPIs are being used at Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner facility in Charleston, South Carolina, where the production rate is seven units per month, Brian West said during his last call as the company\u2019s CFO and finance EVP. Boeing announced last year that it\u2019s investing $1 billion to expand and upgrade two 787 Dreamliner campuses in North Charleston, South Carolina, as it aims to ramp up manufacturing to 10 planes a month by 2026.\n\n\u201cThis is critical to our performance to deliver safe and high-quality aircraft on time to our customers and steadily execute our planned production increases,\u201d Ortberg said.\n\nBoeing named Stephen Parker as president and CEO of its Defense, Space & Security business on July 1, effective immediately. Parker has served as interim leader of the Boeing business unit since September 2024. Courtesy of Boeing\n\nBoeing anticipates being in a position to request approval from the FAA to increase production to 42 aircraft per month in the coming months. Despite the \u201cgood progress,\u201d the company still has a lot of work to do, Ortberg said.\n\nBoeing also made executive changes recently. West will become a senior advisor to Ortberg, with Jesus \u201cJay\u201d Malave, former CFO of Lockheed Martin, succeeding him, effective Aug.15. Boeing also named Stephen Parker as president and CEO of its Defense, Space, and Security business, effective immediately. Parker served as the segment\u2019s interim head since Ted Colbert left the company in September 2024.\n\nMitigating tariffs\n\nThe company expects to incur less than $500 million in tariff impacts, Ortberg said. While Boeing\u2019s finances are on the upswing, the recovery could be impacted by tariffs if deals are not reached by the Aug. 1 and 12 deadlines, according to a securities filing.\n\nApproximately 80% of its commercial supply chain spending is allocated to suppliers in the United States, and around 80% of its commercial deliveries are made to customers outside the U.S., Ortberg said.\n\nNevertheless, the company is encouraged by some of the bilateral trade agreements recently announced, including the U.S. deal with the European Union, West said. The two countries agreed to zero-for-zero tariffs on \u201ca number of strategic products,\u201d including aircraft and component parts.\n\nAnother relevant deal is the U.S. agreement with Japan, as one of Boeing\u2019s key areas is the equipment the company imports from Japan. The pact includes provisions for increased U.S. energy and aerospace exports. Additionally, the White House stated that Japan is expected to purchase 100 Boeing aircraft.\n\nHowever, Boeing is monitoring the trade environment, particularly with Canada, Mexico and Italy concerning its suppliers. The company is also closely tracking negotiations with China, as the country is a significant market for Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile the U.S. and China reached an agreement last month, the deal has yet to be finalized. Still, Ortberg doesn\u2019t expect to see additional tariffs going forward.\n\n\u201cAs a leading U.S. exporter, ongoing free trade is important to our business,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cOur top priority is promoting continuity of supply, and we\u2019re working across the supply chain to ensure suppliers are focused on meeting the strong market demand.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of IAM District 837 during negotiations with Boeing in June. The 3,200 machinists who work at the company's fighter jet facilities in Missouri and Illinois voted to reject Boeing's most recent offer on July 27. Courtesy of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers\n\nAnother pending strike on the defense side\n\nBoeing may face another workers\u2019 strike later this month, this time at its fighter jet facilities in St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri; and Mascoutah, Illinois.\n\nBoeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 initially reached a tentative agreement last week in which the labor union voted to reject the offer, according to the machinists website.\n\nThe current contract expired July 28 and is followed by a seven-day cooling-off period before a strike would begin Aug. 4. Boeing and IAM District 837 resumed negotiations on Thursday and the company proposed its \u201clast, best and final offer\u201d that withdrew alternative workweek schedules, added a reward for good attendance at $0.50 an hour, and a $5,000 bonus if the contract is ratified by the end of Sunday. If the union votes to reject the offer, Boeing said it'll withdraw the $5,000 ratification bonus.\n\nIAM District 837 will vote on Boeing\u2019s modified offer on Sunday. If the union votes to reject the proposal, a strike will begin the following day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve activated our contingency plan and are focused on preparing for a strike,\u201d Boeing said in a July 27 statement.\n\nOrtberg said that if a strike occurs at its Missouri and Illinois facilities, the company will manage through it, since the employee numbers there are significantly smaller than at its Washington and Oregon sites.\n\nThe company experienced a nearly two-month work stoppage last year due to 33,000 IAM District 751 and W24 workers striking at the company\u2019s commercial aircraft facilities on the West Coast, contributing to a significant loss of $11.8 billion in 2024.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFood giant Mars plans to invest $2 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its U.S. manufacturing capabilities and boost product innovation.\n\nThe M&M\u2019s, Snickers and Ben's Original maker said the investment will boost production in America, where 94% of Mars\u2019 products sold are manufactured locally. Mars previously spent $6 billion during the past five years to expand its manufacturing footprint.\n\n\"This investment is about building a stronger, more resilient business in the U.S.,\u201d Claus Aagaard, Mars\u2019 CFO, said in a statement. \"The U.S. is our biggest and most important market, and a key engine of growth for the long term.\u201d\n\nWhile Virginia-based Mars is best known for its candy and sweets business, it also has a large presence in pet food and snack bars, including Nature's Bakery, which it acquired in 2020.

The plant will create more than 230 new jobs in the region and expand the brand's capacity, with the ability to produce nearly one billion bars each year.\n\nNature's Bakery has been a bright spot for Mars.

This includes a new $240 million facility for Nature's Bakery in Utah, opening Wednesday, which will create over 230 new jobs. The Utah plant is designed to produce nearly one billion snack bars annually, significantly expanding the brand's capacity.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDon Brock is a retired senior executive with over 25 years of experience in food and consumer product manufacturing. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nManufacturing in the United States isn\u2019t romantic.\n\nDespite what glossy ads, political speeches and tech expos suggest \u2014 gleaming robots, spotless factories and the promise of bringing jobs back home \u2014 the reality is more brutal.\n\nI\u2019ve learned it\u2019s steel-toed boots, long hours and being measured by your last shift, your last run, your last screw-up. And for those who stay it\u2019s also about pride, grit and mastery. But none of it comes easily.\n\nAs the country talks about reviving American industry, the real question is whether our workforce \u2014 and our expectations \u2014 are ready for what that truly demands. These are some of my lessons from decades on the job.\n\nThe entry point is hard, fast and underpaid\n\nMost people don't \"choose\" manufacturing; they land in it. Sometimes from a technical school. Often from circumstance. You get your foot in the door \u2014 running a filler, packing pallets, loading raw materials \u2014 and you realize quickly that no one's waiting to hand you anything.\n\nThe work is physical. The pay at the beginning is barely enough. Maybe $18 an hour, if you're lucky. Maybe rotating 12-hour shifts with no childcare. The benefits vary widely \u2014 union shops can be solid; non-union ones often tread the fine line between acceptable and exploitative.\n\nAnd the unspoken reality is you may experience injuries, repetitive stress, line fatigue and night shifts that screw up your sleep for years.\n\nThe climb has no map, few guides\n\nMoving up in manufacturing requires more than hustle. It takes visibility, timing and often politics.\n\nThe best operators don't always become supervisors. The best supervisors don't always get promoted. And there's usually no clear pathway \u2014 just a mix of luck, attrition and whoever happens to be watching.\n\nMiddle management? That's where careers either advance or stall. You're stuck between the C-suite's cost obsession and the frontline's daily chaos. You make decisions no one thanks you for and get blamed for outcomes you didn't control.\n\nLeadership in manufacturing is not about glossy strategy decks. It's about walking the floor when you're exhausted, defusing conflicts with HR breathing down your neck, keeping lines running when half the crew calls out and still hitting a margin target that was set by someone who's never touched a valve or heard a piston seize.\n\nThe culture is a mixed bag\n\nThe culture varies. Some plants are toxic: blame-heavy, turf-driven, unsafe. Others are tight-knit, even familial, where veterans look out for rookies and you solve problems with duct tape and a handshake.\n\nBut make no mistake: ego, burnout and generational divides are everywhere. The old guard resents the new hires. The latest hires roll their eyes at \"the way we've always done it.\" HR often spends more time rolling out diversity initiatives than addressing the real, unresolved safety issues on the third shift, where the newest, least experienced workers face the highest risks.\n\nAnd most outsiders \u2014 executives, consultants and media \u2014 don\u2019t understand what it takes to build something, fix something, or keep it running continuously 24/7 without failure.\n\nThe rewards are real, but earned\n\nIf you survive the grind \u2014 and learn to lead \u2014 manufacturing offers something no desk job can. You can point to something and say, \"We made that.\"\n\nYou learn systems. You learn people. You learn what it means to stand up under pressure and keep going when everything's breaking. And for some, you learn how to transform not just product, but culture \u2014 how to lead turnarounds, build teams and leave plants better than you found them.\n\nYes, the money gets better. Six figures is attainable if you transition into operations leadership, technical direction, or supply chain management. But you'll earn every penny in sleepless nights, holiday calls and constant stress.\n\nAnd still, you might get laid off after a merger and reorganized when a private equity group cuts costs or pushed out when you're \"too expensive\" after building the whole damn system.\n\nIt's either a calling, or it breaks you\n\nManufacturing, although not easy, has been a productive career for me. However, are we willing to invest in what it takes to make that the case for everyone?\n\nManufacturing will harden you, humble you, and \u2014 if you let it \u2014 shape you into something fierce and capable. But it\u2019s not for the faint of heart or the glory-seeker.\n\nIt\u2019s for those who believe in execution over excuses, in teams over titles and in building things that matter \u2014 even when no one\u2019s looking.\n\nSo, what\u2019s it like to build a career in U.S. manufacturing? It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s real work.\n\nAs the country rallies around the idea of bringing manufacturing back home, we need to ask: Is this truly what we want? And if so, are we prepared to invest in the education, training and cultural readiness it demands?",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStanley Black & Decker plans to raise its prices again this year as tariff costs continue to weigh on the world\u2019s largest toolmaker. The company initially expected a tariff impact as high as $1.7 billion, but that has since eased as it made operational adjustments and trade negotiations developed.\n\nAfter hiking prices by high single-digits in April during a July 29 earnings call across U.S. retailers, the company is in early talks to implement a \u201cmore modest\u201d round of increases starting in the fourth quarter, COO Christopher Nelson said\n\nStanley Black & Decker is also continuing to adjust its supply chain configurations to mitigate tariffs and making progress with its multi-year, cost reduction program, which is on track to reach $2 billion in total savings by the end of 2025. The program generated $150 million in cost savings in Q2.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs ongoing tariff volatility disrupts trade and commerce, Stanley Black & Decker is focused on achieving 35% adjusted gross margins or higher despite the uncertain economic backdrop, Nelson said on the call.\n\nAs part of these efforts, the company is leveraging its North American footprint while reducing its production in China to less than 5% by the end of 2026, Nelson said. It is also collaborating with customers on ways to deliver the most cost-effective products to end-users, and engaging with the U.S. administration on trade-related goals and challenges.\n\n\u201cWe plan to leverage supply chain moves and targeted pricing actions to improve our gross margin in the coming quarters,\u201d CEO Donald Allan said. \u201cWe believe Q2 to be the low point for gross margins, barring any new large changes to government policies.\u201d\n\nDuring Q2, Stanley Black & Decker reported revenue of $3.9 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, citing a slow outdoor buying season and tariff-related shipment disruptions. A roughly 4% drop in sales volume was offset by a 1% increase in prices and 1% increase in currency.\n\nIn addition to the tools and outdoor division, which comprises about 90% of total revenue, the company also has an engineered fastening division that supplies nuts and bolts to manufacturers.\n\nThat division generated $484 million in Q2 sales, also down about 2% from a year ago. While it saw strong demand from aerospace customers, the company said declines in the automotive and industrial businesses outweighed those benefits.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 27% in the quarter, down 140 basis points from last year. It also posted Q2 net earnings of $101.9 million compared to a loss of $19.2 million in Q2 2024.\n\n\u201cOverall, a very solid quarter in a turbulent environment,\u201d Allan said on his last earnings call.\n\nAllan is scheduled to become executive chairman of Stanley Black & Decker, effective October. The company last month named Nelson as his successor.\n\nFollowing the April price hikes, Nelson said the company saw no noticeable \u201cshift in buying trends,\u201d signaling relatively healthy demand as it works to cut costs and boost margins.\n\n\u201cOur simplified and more nimble supply chain is enabling us to deliver improved profitability, better service for our customers and end users and sustainable market share gains,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nStanley Black & Decker provided no Q3 outlook, but updated investors on the potential tariffs cost impact for 2025.\n\nThe company is forecasting a gross tariff cost impact of $800 million for the year, excluding mitigation efforts. CFO Patrick Hallinan said the calculations factor in 30% incremental tariffs on goods from China, 30% on non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and more than 20% in aggregate on goods from the rest of the world. The company also factored in 50% Section 232 metal tariffs.\n\nIncluding mitigation efforts, Stanley Black & Decker is expecting a negative earnings per share impact of 65 cents for 2025, which is 10 cents lower than its headwind estimate from Q1.",

View past columns in the archives here.\n\nFor marketers to, as the conventional wisdom goes, move at the speed of culture, they need to be embedded in the dirt of social media, in touch with grassroots developments and ready to scale organizational branches. Doing so can allow ideas to bear fruit, as in the latest campaign from Miracle-Gro, which encourages consumers to embrace the idea of a \u201cFull Bush Summer.\u201d\n\nAs with almost every contemporary trend, \u201cfull bush in a bikini\u201d kicked off with a video on TikTok that now has over 17 million views. That direct, body-positive sentiment about pubic hair has since spread across social and traditional media, showing up in Vogue, Glamour and Women\u2019s Health. It also caught the eye of The Martin Agency, which serves as Miracle-Gro\u2019s creative agency of record.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't [a brief] \u2014 this was a fully proactive idea from The Martin Agency team,\u201d said Nadezhda Camperlengo, vice president at head of social at the agency. \u201cThey brought it to me, and I was like, \u2018This is bigger than one post. This is bigger than just a social moment. This is bigger than just one element.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe campaign, which will run across organic and paid social with digital banner placements, merchandise giveaways and an influencer partnership, is the type of lightning-in-a-bottle moment that marketers are always looking to capture \u2014 even when they come with possible brand safety concerns.\n\n\u201cObviously, this concept is a bit edgy, but it is really true to our roots and our brand purpose, which is encouraging growth, empowerment and self-expression through gardening,\u201d said Sadie Oldham, vice president and head of gardens at the company. \u201cWhile it was playful, the message was sincere in that Miracle-Gro supports healthy growth, however that might look to you.\u201d\n\nGrowing an ecosystem\n\nWhile the \u201cfull bush\u201d idea had a clever connection to Miracle-Gro\u2019s purpose and products, it would need to be more than just an ephemeral trend or TikTok format for the Martin Agency to craft a durable brand campaign around it. But beyond the pun, the agency found a resonant brand truth in the moment.\n\n\u201cThis is a return to natural beauty and self-expression. It's a larger cultural phenomenon\u2026 there's longevity to that,\u201d Camperlengo explained. \u201cThe conversation itself is way more than a TikTok and way more than a hashtag.\u201d\n\nCamperlengo quickly reached out to folks throughout the agency and encouraged them to embrace blue sky thinking as they generated every idea they could around the concept, knowing that Miracle-Gro has pushed the agency to be creative and embrace the uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt was truly like a writer's room type of vibe, of how we built this ecosystem as a team, but we knew that beyond TikTok, this is a human truth and experience that we wanted to hit from as many designs as possible,\u201d Camperlengo said.\n\nFor Miracle-Gro, the campaign represented a way to speak to the young consumers who are new to the gardening category and also highly engaged online.\n\n\u201cWe felt the spark. it was unexpected.

She stood for those things in addition to just being herself and always standing for self-expression,\u201d Camperlengo said.\n\nAlong with Windey\u2019s content, banner placements across Amazon and other social media elements, the campaign also features baby tees emblazoned with the tagline, \"Nobody knows I'm growing a full bush rn\u201d \u2014 another example of how the effort jumps on another trend that has hit the pages of Vogue.\n\n\u201cTo be connected to culture, you need to show up in places where people experience cultures,\u201d Oldham said. \u201cWe cannot wait to continue to explore other fun and kitschy ways to surprise and delight our audiences with funny campaigns like this.\u201d",

Developed proactively by The Martin Agency, it includes organic and paid social media, digital banner placements, merchandise giveaways, and an influencer partnership with Gabby Windey. The goal is to reach young consumers new to gardening and highly engaged online.\n\n**Why it matters:** This \"edgy\" campaign for Miracle-Gro, a gardening company, is described as a \"lightning-in-a-bottle moment\" with \"possible brand safety concerns.\" It challenges conventional marketing by embracing an \"unexpected\" and culturally relevant trend to connect with younger consumers. The company believes the campaign aligns with its brand purpose of \"encouraging growth, empowerment and self-expression through gardening,\" demonstrating a willingness to be creative and \"embrace the uncomfortable.\" This approach may signal a shift in how traditional brands engage with new demographics, potentially departing from more conservative marketing norms.\n\n**The big picture:** The conventional wisdom for marketers is to \"move at the speed of culture\" by closely monitoring social media trends. The \"full bush in a bikini\" concept began as a TikTok video with over 17 million views, subsequently spreading across social and traditional media like Vogue and Glamour. The Martin Agency proactively identified this cultural phenomenon and connected it to Miracle-Gro's brand purpose of encouraging growth and self-expression.

The company helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million consumers in the U.S. through full-funnel offerings that include its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 its DSP.\n\n\u201cOur trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping, and streaming signals paired with extensive supply side relationships and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to optimize advertising, deliver greater precision, and drive efficient and effective advertising outcomes,\u201d CEO Andy Jassy said of the DSP on an earnings call.\n\nAlong with revamping the DSP user experience in October, Amazon in June integrated it with Disney\u2019s Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX), allowing advertisers to leverage insights from both companies.

The company\u2019s guidance around operating income in Q3 was lower than analysts expected.

While not seeing tariff-related demand or price impacts yet, Amazon's Q3 guidance for net sales was wide, and operating income guidance was lower than expected due to macroeconomic factors.\n\n**Why it matters:** Amazon's ad business continues growing faster than its core retail, signifying a strong, high-margin revenue stream. Strategic deals with Roku and Disney, alongside AI tools, expand its advertising ecosystem and reach to over 300 million U.S. consumers.

The brand, which is over 40 years old, is viewed as nostalgic by millennials, according to press materials.\n\nThe campaign is the brand\u2019s first big marketing push in several years and will span TV, online video, social and digital channels. It signals a messaging shift by Lunchables after moving away from its \u201cBuilt To Be Eaten\u201d brand platform in 2020.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOnce the undisputed king of pre-packed lunch products marketed to children, Lunchables has seen its dominance weaken amid increased competition. As competitors crowd grocery store shelves, Lunchables is hoping to reignite interest in the brand for kids and parents alike with what it\u2019s saying is its first far-reaching marketing push in several years.\n\nIn its Q2 2025 earnings release this week, the company pointed to declining volume for Lunchables and said it expects sluggish sales across several brands to continue throughout the year. On an earnings call, executives said the company plans to ramp up marketing spend in the second half, including by up to 75% for brands like Lunchables and Capri Sun, according to Adweek.\n\n\u201cThe Lunchables Effect\u201d was inspired by social media conversations surrounding the product. There are over 170 Reddit threads talking about how \u201ccool\u201d Lunchables are, according to press materials. Many are made by older consumers reminiscing about the role the product played during their school years. Nostalgia is a go-to marketing strategy for consumer brands looking to reach a wide audience with feel-good messaging at a time of divisiveness and economic uncertainty.\n\nVideo spots focus on the impact Lunchables can have for kids during difficult moments. In \u201cShoulders,\u201d a kid is hoisted into the air by classmates after biting into a Lunchables. In \u201cFractions,\u201d the product serves as a valuable bargaining chip during a trade.\n\n\u201cBy tapping into the way kids truly enjoy the beloved lunchtime staple, we were able to creatively show the \u2018cool effect\u2019 and reinforce the brand as a classic, bold and beloved everyday choice around back to school season,\u201d said Alyssa Cicero, senior brand manager, Lunchables, in a statement.\n\nLunchables has faced competition from Lunchly, an alternative from influencers Logan Paul, Mr. Beast and KSI. Lunchly claims to be the healthier alternative to Lunchables, boasting higher electrolyte counts, fewer calories and less sugar. However, Lunchly isn\u2019t without its controversy. The product was plagued by mold accusations.\n\nLunchables has had its own share of controversy over the years. In 2024 Kraft Heinz pulled Lunchables from U.S. schools after a nutritional controversy. Since 2018, the brand\u2019s market share has slipped to approximately 60%, a 25-point drop. Its new campaign arrives ahead of Kraft Heinz\u2019s expected spin-off of its grocery brands, including Lunchables, following a difficult few years for sales as consumer tastes change.",

This aggressive marketing push challenges any consensus that Lunchables could maintain its market position without significant intervention, given the persistent sales decline and market share drop.\n\n**The big picture:**\nLunchables, a brand over 40 years old, has seen its market share slip to approximately 60% since 2018, a 25-point drop. This decline is attributed to increased competition and changing consumer tastes. The brand has also faced controversies, including Kraft Heinz pulling Lunchables from U.S. schools in 2024 due to nutritional concerns. Competitors like Lunchly, claiming to be healthier, have emerged, further challenging Lunchables' market position.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Campaign released on Aug. 29.\n*   Lunchables is over 40 years old.\n*   Executives plan to ramp up marketing spend by up to 75% for brands like Lunchables.\n*   Over 170 Reddit threads discuss Lunchables being \"cool.\"\n*   Lunchables market share has slipped to approximately 60% since 2018, a 25-point drop.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Kraft Heinz:** Parent company of Lunchables, reported declining volume and plans increased marketing spend.\n*   **Lunchables:** Kraft Heinz brand launching a new marketing campaign amid weakening dominance and sales.\n*   **Mischief:** Developed \"The Lunchables Effect\" campaign with Lunchables.\n*   **Alyssa Cicero:** Senior brand manager for Lunchables, quoted on the campaign's \"cool effect.\"\n*   **Capri Sun:** Another Kraft Heinz brand slated for up to 75% increased marketing spend.\n*   **Logan Paul, Mr. Beast, KSI:** Influencers behind Lunchly, a competitor to Lunchables.\n*   **Lunchly:** Competitor product claiming to be healthier than Lunchables, but plagued by mold accusations.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The new campaign arrives ahead of Kraft Heinz's expected spin-off of its grocery brands, including Lunchables.\n*   Kraft Heinz expects sluggish sales across several brands to continue throughout the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nKraft Heinz invests heavily to revive Lunchables amid market share decline.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Starbucks Sales Decline Continues, Turnaround Efforts Show Positive Signs\n\n**Key details:** Starbucks reported a 2% decline in U.S. comparable store sales for its Q3 fiscal year 2025, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines. This decline was partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket. Despite the sales trend, the company beat Wall Street revenue estimates. Customer value perceptions of the brand are near two-year highs, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennial consumers.\n\n**Why it matters:** Despite persistent sales declines, CEO Brian Niccol states Starbucks' \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround effort is working and ahead of schedule. The CEO attributes this progress to improved marketing and operational enhancements. This positive sentiment, coupled with improved customer value perceptions and transaction growth among non-rewards customers, challenges a purely negative view based on the headline sales number, suggesting underlying momentum.\n\n**The big picture:** Starbucks is implementing a \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround effort, which includes significant investments in marketing and operational improvements like the Green Apron Service. The company believes its enhanced marketing strategies are positively impacting the business. Recent marketing efforts include a January spot and a Super Bowl pre-game ad, both designed to reintroduce the brand's story.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   U.S. comparable store sales: Down 2% in Q3 FY2025.\n*   Average ticket: Up 2%.\n*   Same-store sales: Sixth straight quarter of declines.\n*   Customer value perceptions: Near two-year highs.\n*   Rewards program members: 34 million 90-day active members.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Starbucks:** Saw U.S. comparable store sales decline but confident in turnaround efforts.\n*   **Brian Niccol:** CEO of Starbucks, cited marketing and operational improvements for turnaround.\n*   **Wall Street:** Starbucks beat their revenue estimates for the recent quarter.\n*   **Gen Z:** Consumers in this group are driving gains in Starbucks' customer value perceptions.\n*   **Millennials:** Consumers in this group are also driving gains in Starbucks' customer value perceptions.\n*   **The Ting Ting\u2019s:** Band whose song was featured in a Starbucks marketing spot aired in January.\n*   **Stagwell:** Parent company of agency Anomaly, which created Starbucks' recent ad campaigns.\n*   **Anomaly:** Agency that won Starbucks\u2019 creative business at the top of the year.\n*   **WPP:** Holding company that previously held Starbucks' creative duties, facing setbacks.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Significant improvements to Starbucks' rewards program are planned for early 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Sales decline continues, but Starbucks sees turnaround gaining traction.",

Campaigns and creative for brand partners are also informed by Disney's swath of consumer data and insights and can leverage commerce-driven ads.\n\nAdvertiser interest in \u201cProject Runway\u201d arrives as U.S. ad spending on connected TV is expected to grow 16.8% in 2025 to reach $33.48 billion, per eMarketer forecasts. Simultaneously, streaming continues to grow as consumers\u2019 preferred method of viewing. Streaming outpaced the combined share of broadcast and cable viewing for the first time in May, according to Nielsen.\n\nCalia by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will be featured in a \u201cProject Runway\u201d episode through a sponsored challenge where contestants on the show create a piece inspired by the athleisure brand. The winning look, made from Calia fabric, will be produced and sold at Dick\u2019s. During the same episode, contestants will also be sporting clothing from the brand.\n\nAdditionally, Calia signed on as the first brand to participate in Disney\u2019s new commerce-driven ad solution, Shop the Stream, to allow viewers to shop looks from the marketer from their screens. Commerce media and CTV have been becoming more closely aligned as marketers attempt to generate more tangible results, like foot traffic and sales, from a channel that\u2019s typically leveraged for mass reach.\n\nUlta Beauty will serve as the exclusive beauty sponsor of season 21. Integrations include a custom \u201cSalon at Ulta Beauty\u201d on set, which was used by models for hair and makeup each episode before every runway. Additionally, some episodes will include conversations between designers, models and makeup artists about Ulta Beauty services.\n\nOne episode of the series is inspired by PNC Bank\u2019s \u201cBrilliantly Boring\u201d campaign, which asserts the brand\u2019s dedication to being \u201cboring\u201d by staying steady and reliable, by tasking contestants to transform \u201cboring\u201d fabrics into something fresh. PNC and \u201cProject Runway\u201d will also run a custom 30-second spot within the episode, followed by a 10-second co-branded slate that will run once the episodes become available on streaming. Social posts will also run after the episode debuts on Freeform.\n\nPilot Pens\u2019 Pilot FriXion Erasable Pen is the exclusive writing tool for contestants, and viewers will see in-show brand integrations and placements of designers using the pen during the season. Lilly hosted a sponsored challenge that tasked contestants to create a comfortable \u201cnight on the town\u201d outfit for people with skin sensitivities, including eczema.\n\nIn a sponsored challenge, contestants were tasked to create an avant-garde look inspired by Universal Pictures\u2019 forthcoming film \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d That episode will also feature an appearance by Paul Tazewell, the Oscar-winning costume designer from the film.\n\nDisney Advertising recently completed its 2025-26 upfronts presentation, reporting that overall volume is consistent with the year prior despite sports and streaming seeing increased sales. Notably, sports advertising volume across linear and addressable is nearly $4 billion, inclusive of 69 multi-year deals and women\u2019s sports volume growth up double digits.

In March, Kroger promoted Yael Cosset to executive vice president and chief digital officer to lead the division. It comes at a time when the grocer is pushing to make e-commerce profitable.

Kroger stated this change will help fuel full-funnel brand growth and build integrated commercial services at 84.51\u00b0.

Emulating old-school porn is a different beast, however, and could raise eyebrows for Doritos\u2019s Golden Sriracha variant, which is being positioned as the Frito-Lay marketer\u2019s potential next big flavor innovation.\n\n\u201cA Spicy, but Not Too Spicy Plumber\u201d carries the hazy look and corny feel of \u201870s smut, opening on a vinyl record starting to spin on a turntable. Goggins, who is having a moment in the cultural spotlight, stars as a plumber hired to fix a blond bombshell\u2019s broken pipes. Just as their conversation is reaching a fever pitch of innuendo, Goggins ruins the moment by describing the source of the sink leak in great technical detail. The viewer is meant to understand that everyone is operating from an X-rated script but him.\n\nThe arrival of a male roommate who hears \u201cbanging\u201d does little to break the plumber out of his straight-arrow character, nor does the later appearance of a \u201ccougar\u201d drawn to sounds of moaning (over the plumber\u2019s payment plan options). Only after biting into a Golden Sriracha Dorito does Goggins\u2019 protagonist seem to recognize the genre he\u2019s in, just in time for an \u201cextra large sausage\u201d pizza, courtesy of a ridiculous-looking delivery man.\n\nThe racy creative premiered as part of an event at the Slipper Room, an iconic Lower East Side venue that is credited with helping bring neo-burlesque to New York. A 360-degree media plan supports the short, including digital, social and OOH ads, including some placed around Times Square, once the seedy home of adult theaters. Doritos is also leveraging Instagram\u2019s broadcast channel feature for content that further straddles the NSFW line.\n\nDoritos said the effort, developed with agency Rethink, was informed by Gen Z\u2019s preference for flavors that are spicy without overcranking the heat index. \u201cA Spicy, but Not Too Spicy Plumber\u201d follows that lead with humor that is \u201cplayful and suggestive\u201d without ever being explicit. Doritos Golden Sriracha, which is now sold nationwide, is part of a larger wave of food and beverage products trying to capitalize on Gen Z\u2019s love of spicy snacks.\n\n\u201cBy elevating Doritos Golden Sriracha, a globally inspired flavor that balances tanginess and sweetness with approachable heat, with a campaign that playfully subverts expectations, we hope to inspire fans to take a bite of what could be our next \u2018mega-flavor,\u2019\u201d said Tina Mahal, SVP marketing at PepsiCo Foods U.S., in a statement.\n\nWhile the over-the-top approach could court controversy, Goggins may also help bolster Doritos\u2019 appeal. The actor has achieved fresh levels of popularity thanks to roles in streaming hits like HBO Max\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cFallout.\u201d Brand deals have quickly followed, with the actor appearing in recent campaigns for companies like Walmart and GoDaddy.",

The campaign centers on a long-form video, \"A Spicy, but Not Too Spicy Plumber,\" starring actor Walton Goggins. This video features innuendo, but Goggins' character initially undercuts it until eating Doritos.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Trump administration announced an initiative Wednesday that aims to boost health data sharing through partnerships with major healthcare and technology firms, including Amazon, Google, UnitedHealth and Epic.\n\nThe Health Tech Ecosystem focuses on two areas: encouraging adoption of a voluntary blueprint for data sharing called CMS Interoperability Framework and increasing the availability of digital health tools, like products for chronic disease management and care navigation, the CMS said in a press release.\n\nMore than 60 companies \u2014 including technology firms, providers, insurers and health data sharing networks \u2014 have pledged to participate in the initiative. The partnership aims to \u201cdeliver results for the American people\u201d in the first quarter next year, the CMS said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nInteroperability and information sharing is a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector, made harder by siloed data that doesn\u2019t easily flow between providers and a reliance on dated technology like fax machines.\n\nStill, the industry has seen some recent progress on health data sharing. In late 2023, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, a governance framework for information exchange, went live after years of effort.\n\nTEFCA launched with five Qualified Health Information Networks, or QHINs, and their number has since expanded to nine, including new additions like e-prescribing Surescripts\u2019 data exchange and ambulatory electronic health record vendor eClinicalWorks.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is launching its own data sharing initiative. It includes the CMS Interoperability Framework, which the agency said is a \u201ccall to action for health data networks that want to move faster.\u201d\n\nThe framework\u2019s criteria are supposed to be \u201cvisionary,\u201d the CMS said. Some of the goals include ensuring patients can access their electronic medical data anywhere on the network, using apps of their choice.\n\nPatients should also be able to access claims, explanation of benefits and prior authorizations from current and past payers, and data queries should be responded to quickly \u2014 possibly in real time, according to the CMS.\n\n\u201cFor too long, patients in this country have been burdened with a healthcare system that has not kept pace with the disruptive innovations that have transformed nearly every other sector of our economy,\u201d CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. \u201cWith the commitments made by these entrepreneurial companies today, we stand ready for a paradigm shift in the U.S. healthcare system for the benefit of patients and providers.\u201d\n\nAdvaMed, an influential medtech lobbying group, praised the initiative Wednesday. Shaye Mandle, executive director of AdvaMed\u2019s Digital Health Tech division, said the \u201cera of personalized, precision medicine is upon us,\u201d but it requires data that can be connected across the continuum of care.\n\n\u201cThe medtech industry is vital to the delivery of care and the improvement of patient outcomes, and we can do even more with additional tools,\u201d Mandle said. \u201cAccess to critical information for research and development can be a challenge for medtech innovators to obtain. Greater access would promote the personalized, precise medtech design, utilization, and care patients deserve.

It focuses on encouraging adoption of a voluntary data sharing blueprint, the CMS Interoperability Framework, and increasing the availability of digital health tools. Over 60 companies, spanning technology firms, providers, insurers, and health data sharing networks, have pledged to participate. The partnership aims to \"deliver results for the American people\" in the first quarter of next year.\n\n**Why it matters:** This initiative targets the healthcare sector's persistent challenge of siloed data and reliance on dated technology. It aims to enable patients to access their electronic medical data anywhere, using apps of their choice, and quickly obtain claims and prior authorizations. This push could challenge the current consensus of slow progress in health data sharing, with the CMS Administrator stating they are ready for a \"paradigm shift\" in the U.S. healthcare system. It seeks to promote personalized, precision medicine through connected data.\n\n**The big picture:** Interoperability and information sharing has been a long-term challenge for the healthcare sector, made harder by data that doesn\u2019t easily flow. While some recent progress includes the late 2023 launch of TEFCA, a governance framework for information exchange which expanded to nine Qualified Health Information Networks, this new initiative is a separate data sharing effort by the Trump administration. The CMS Interoperability Framework is described as a \"call to action for health data networks that want to move faster.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 60 companies have pledged to participate in the initiative.\n*   21 companies pledged to become CMS Aligned Networks.\n*   11 health systems committed to participating in the networks.\n*   30 companies joined the initiative to improve health outcomes with technology.\n*   The partnership aims to \"deliver results\" in the first quarter next year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Trump administration:** Announced new initiative to boost health data sharing.\n*   **CMS:** Agency launching \"Health Tech Ecosystem\" initiative, outlining framework and goals.\n*   **Amazon:** Major technology firm partnering in the health data initiative.\n*   **Google:** Major technology firm partnering in initiative, improving health outcomes.\n*   **UnitedHealth:** Major healthcare firm partnering in the data sharing initiative.\n*   **Epic:** Major firm partnering, also an EHR vendor pledging as CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **Dr. Mehmet Oz:** CMS Administrator, stated the system is ready for a paradigm shift.\n*   **AdvaMed:** Influential medtech lobbying group, praised the new initiative Wednesday.\n*   **Shaye Mandle:** AdvaMed executive, stressed connected data for personalized, precision medicine.\n*   **Surescripts:** E-prescribing data exchange, a new addition to TEFCA\u2019s QHINs.\n*   **eClinicalWorks:** EHR vendor, new addition to TEFCA\u2019s QHINs, and CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **Oracle Health:** EHR and health IT vendor, pledged as a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **athenahealth:** EHR and health IT vendor, pledged as a CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **CommonWell Health Alliance:** Data exchange with QHIN status, pledged as CMS Aligned Network.\n*   **Cleveland Clinic:** Health system that pledged to participate in the new networks.\n*   **Bon Secours Mercy Health:** Health system that pledged to participate in the new networks.\n*   **Intermountain Health:** Health system that pledged to participate in the new networks.\n*   **Apple:** Joined initiative to improve health outcomes with technology.\n*   **Samsung:** Joined initiative to improve health outcomes with technology.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The partnership aims to \"deliver results\" in the first quarter of next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New Trump initiative pushes faster healthcare data sharing with major industry partners.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBy the numbers Q2 revenue: $1.16 billion 15% increase year over year Q2 net income: $179.8 million 25% increase year over year\n\nDexcom raised its sales expectations for 2025 amid expanding access to its glucose sensors for people with Type 2 diabetes. The company raised its revenue forecast to a range of $4.6 billion to about $4.63 billion for 2025, after forecasting $4.6 billion last quarter.\n\nCFO Jereme Sylvain, on a Wednesday earnings call, attributed the change to three of the major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers now covering Dexcom\u2019s continuous glucose monitors for people with Type 2 diabetes who don\u2019t take insulin. The company is also looking to adoption of its over-the-counter device, Stelo, as a growth driver.\n\nAlthough Dexcom does not disclose exact user numbers, outgoing CEO Kevin Sayer said the company\u2019s Stelo app has been downloaded more than 400,000 times. Dexcom launched the over-the-counter glucose sensor last year, with the intent of marketing it to people with Type 2 diabetes who don\u2019t take insulin. However, most of the recent uptake has been by people who don\u2019t have diabetes and are buying the devices for health and wellness, Sayer said.\n\n\u201cQuite candidly, that's how we designed and developed the app, because last year, at this time, we didn't have very much of any Type 2 coverage for non-insulin users,\u201d Sayer said. \u201cAs time has gone on, and now G7 has coverage by the three largest PBMs in the country, we're seeing a shift.\u201d\n\nPlans for a multi-analyte sensor\n\nDexcom\u2019s main competitor, Abbott, has been working on a dual-analyte sensor that can detect both glucose and ketone levels. The company struck several planned integrations leading up to the American Diabetes Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions last month.\n\nWhen asked about plans for Dexcom\u2019s next flagship CGM, the G8, Chief Operating Officer Jake Leach, who will take over as CEO at the beginning of next year, said the sensor will be 50% smaller and will include a chip that supports multiple analyte sensing. He did not share the timing for the device.\n\nLeach said that there have been a lot of recent discussions around the clinical utility of measuring ketones simultaneously with glucose. Dexcom has a ketone sensor in development, \u201cand we'll bring it to the market when we feel it's appropriate,\u201d Leach said. \u201cBut at this point in time, we're very focused on features that extend safety and ease of use for both our patients as well as the prescribing physicians.\u201d\n\nRegulatory updates\n\nDexcom is still working with the Food and Drug Administration on resolving a warning letter the company received in March, which raised concerns with a design change Dexcom made to a component used in its sensors without submitting a premarket notification to the FDA. Dexcom had begun to produce a chemical internally for its sensor wires to add redundancy to its supply chain, but reverted back to the external supplier after the FDA requested a separate 510(k) submission, J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in March.\n\nThe company has made \u201cquite a bit of progress\u201d in updating its processes and documentation to address the FDA\u2019s concerns, Leach said.\n\nDexcom is also resolving a recall where receivers for its CGMs may not sound an audible alarm for low or high blood sugar levels. Sylvain said the company will be swapping out some receivers. The CFO said Dexcom recorded a charge in the second quarter that had a 100-basis-point impact on its quarterly results.",

This change is attributed to three major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers now covering Dexcom\u2019s continuous glucose monitors for people with Type 2 diabetes who do not take insulin. The company also anticipates growth from its over-the-counter device, Stelo. However, Stelo\u2019s recent uptake is primarily from non-diabetic users purchasing for health and wellness. Dexcom is also developing a smaller G8 sensor with multiple analyte sensing capabilities and a ketone sensor.\n\n**Why it matters:** The increased sales expectations signal significant growth potential from expanding access to a large, underserved patient population, specifically non-insulin Type 2 diabetes patients. The unexpected user base shift for Stelo towards general health and wellness indicates a broader market beyond traditional diabetes management. Development of multi-analyte sensors positions Dexcom to compete with rivals like Abbott and address evolving clinical needs in glucose monitoring. This challenges any consensus view that Dexcom's growth is limited to insulin-dependent users, by demonstrating new market penetration into non-insulin Type 2 and the wellness sector.\n\n**The big picture:** Dexcom launched its over-the-counter Stelo sensor last year, initially targeting Type 2 diabetes patients not on insulin, at a time when specific coverage was limited.

Dexcom and Abbott collaborated last year to launch the first over-the-counter glucose sensors.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Jake Leach has worked at Dexcom for 21 years.\n*   Leach served as chief technology officer from 2018 to 2022.\n*   He was named COO in late 2022.\n*   Leach was given the title of president in May.\n*   Kevin Sayer will still be involved with Dexcom for the next five months.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Dexcom:** A diabetes tech company undergoing a planned CEO transition after a decade of leadership.\n*   **Kevin Sayer:** Stepping down as CEO after a decade, remaining executive chairman of Dexcom\u2019s board.\n*   **Jake Leach:** Current COO, set to become Dexcom\u2019s CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and join the board.\n*   **Abbott:** A competitor expanding integrations and offering longer-lasting implantable sensors in the glucose monitoring sector.\n*   **Marie Thibault (BTIG analyst):** Stated Leach\u2019s appointment is not a surprise due to his promotions and visibility to investors.\n*   **Robbie Marcus (J.P. Morgan analyst):** Noted the change was telegraphed but expressed nervousness about a long-time CEO's retirement.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Jake Leach will assume the CEO role on Jan. 1, 2026.\n*   Kevin Sayer will remain involved with Dexcom for the next five months to assist with the transition.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nDexcom's planned CEO transition prompts investor nervousness despite long signaling.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBy the numbers Q2 revenue: $5 billion 3% increase year over year Net income: $486 million Nearly 14% increase year over year\n\nGE HealthCare lowered the expected impact from tariffs on its financial outlook Wednesday and said customer demand for capital equipment remained healthy in the second quarter.\n\nThe medical imaging company boosted its forecast for organic revenue growth in 2025 to 3%, up from a range of 2% to 3%.\n\nHowever, shares in the company fell nearly 8% to end at $71.64 on the New York Stock Exchange, as investors focused on slower-than-expected order growth and a delayed market recovery in China. J.P. Morgan analysts, in a Wednesday note to investors, said second-quarter order growth of about 3% year over year was below the 5% that investors wanted, and the outlook for China was disappointing.\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter Arduini told analysts on the earnings call that the situation in China continues to evolve.\n\n\u201cI'd say China, we're seeing activity pick up, but the market recovery is taking a little bit longer,\u201d said Arduini. \u201cWe think the longer-term outlook will be positive just based on the size of the country.\u201d\n\nStill, with greater clarity from deals struck between the U.S. and global trade partners, GE HealthCare now expects a 45-cent tariff impact to adjusted earnings per share for the full year, roughly half of the 85-cent hit it projected last quarter. The reduction is similar to revised outlooks from other large medical device makers, such as Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, which also halved their tariff impact forecasts.\n\nGE HealthCare raised its full-year outlook for adjusted EPS to a range of $4.43 to $4.63, from the previous forecast of $3.90 to $4.10. The improved outlook follows the company\u2019s steep earnings guidance cut in April.\n\nFor 2026, tariff expenses are expected to be below the 45 cents forecast for 2025 due to mitigation efforts that include supply chain restructuring actions and selective price increases.\n\nCFO Jay Saccaro, on the earnings call, said the company is working on longer-term changes to the supply chain, such as investing in more local manufacturing and shifting capacity within supplier networks to more tariff-friendly locations.\n\n\u201cAs we've seen these trade deals shape up, we're now in a position to begin to execute on some of these, which we'll do in the second half of the year, and then those will benefit 2026,\u201d Saccaro said.\n\nCapital equipment investment\n\nRepublicans\u2019 \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d has sparked concerns among healthcare investors that patient volumes could soften if people lose insurance coverage, with the trend in turn pressuring hospital budgets.\n\nGE HealthCare, however, is seeing a \u201crobust\u201d capital environment and healthy procedure growth, said Saccaro, with customers continuing to invest in innovative imaging equipment.\n\nIn the U.S., hospitals are replacing an aging installed base of equipment, after the replacement cycle was paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Arduini. Further driving demand is a need for imaging to support treatment advances in areas such as electrophysiology and pharmaceuticals that require more follow-up. Hospitals also want equipment that helps increase productivity.\n\n\u201cIt's difficult for U.S. hospitals to get staffed, and so equipment that moves the patient swiftly through the institution with a high-quality diagnosis is a very important asset,\u201d said the CEO.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** GE HealthCare shares dip as China lags, tariff hit halved.\n\n**Key details:** GE HealthCare reduced its full-year tariff impact to 45 cents per share, about half its previous projection. The company also boosted its 2025 organic revenue growth forecast to 3% and raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance. Despite these positive revisions, shares fell nearly 8% due to slower-than-expected Q2 order growth of about 3%. Investors also focused on a delayed market recovery in China.\n\n**Why it matters:** The share decline, despite improved financial forecasts and reduced tariff impact, indicates investors prioritized slower order growth and China's market recovery, challenging the immediate positive impact of the revised outlook. This suggests the market\u2019s consensus on the company\u2019s near-term drivers is heavily weighted toward market expansion. GE HealthCare's robust capital environment and healthy procedure growth also contrast with broader healthcare investor concerns about patient volumes softening.\n\n**The big picture:** GE HealthCare's lowered tariff impact aligns with similar revised outlooks from other large medical device makers like Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. The improved financial forecast follows the company\u2019s steep earnings guidance cut in April. In the U.S., hospitals are driving demand for capital equipment by replacing aging units paused during the pandemic and seeking productivity tools.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 revenue: $5 billion, a 3% increase year over year.\n*   Net income: $486 million, a nearly 14% increase year over year.\n*   Shares fell nearly 8% to $71.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n*   Q2 order growth: about 3% year over year, below the 5% investors wanted.\n*   Full-year adjusted EPS forecast: $4.43 to $4.63 (previously $3.90 to $4.10).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **GE HealthCare:** Medical imaging company that reported mixed Q2 results, reducing tariff impact while facing order growth and China concerns.\n*   **Peter Arduini:** CEO of GE HealthCare, stated China's market recovery is taking longer but sees a positive long-term outlook.\n*   **Jay Saccaro:** CFO of GE HealthCare, confirmed the company is experiencing a robust capital environment and planning supply chain changes.\n*   **J.P.

Currently, 412 units in the portfolio are offline, according to a news release shared with Multifamily Dive.\n\n\u201cHurricane Ida came through the properties and money was not invested back into them,\u201d said Steven Landgraber, senior managing director at New York City-based merchant bank IslandDundon, which was hired to advise Crown Capital on its restructuring strategy. \u201cSome of those units have just been down for quite some time.\u201d\n\nChicago-based commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield and New Orleans-based brokerage firm Larry G. Schedler & Associates are leading the sales effort on behalf of a court-appointed ownership entity representing the portfolio\u2019s debtors. The apartment communities could be sold individually or as a portfolio. There is no set price, and offers are due Sept. 10.\n\n\u201cThese assets have been effectively starved for capital and have not had leadership for quite some time due to prior management\u2019s absence,\u201d Landgraber said.\n\nLarry Schedler, principal of Larry G. Schedler & Associates, told Multifamily Dive that the properties received new roofs after Hurricane Ida, but are still in need of interior renovations.\n\n\u201cAlthough there's some exterior work to do, the majority of the capital that needs to be expended is really going to be in the interiors,\u201d Schedler said. \u201cThree of the four are in the upper-40% to low-50% occupancy range. There is one asset that is about 20% occupied.\u201d\n\nThe portfolio consists of:\n\nCarmel Brook, a 548-unit property, built in 1984\n\nCarmel Spring, a 400-unit property, built in 1983\n\nLaguna Creek, a 216-unit property built in 1981\n\nLaguna Reserve, a 348-unit multifamily community built in 1982\n\nThe portfolio is located within a 3-mile radius along Interstate 10 in the East New Orleans Opportunity Zone. That area lost nearly 4,000 units after Hurricane Katrina, making these four properties one-third of the housing stock in the area, according to Schedler.\n\n\u201cThere's a shortage of affordable housing in metro New Orleans, like there is all over the country,\u201d Schedler said. \u201cThis creates a very interesting opportunity for someone. All of these properties have washer-dryer connections, so they would they would be a great candidate for good, solid workforce housing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Schedler said private buyers have shown interest in the portfolio. The right purchaser could potentially transform the entire area.\n\n\u201cIt's a real opportunity for someone to get in there who has the construction expertise to bring these units online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt they would have demand for these units, and I think some of the reverberations of this would certainly help with them trying to create more rooftops out there.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEarlier this week, Greensboro, North Carolina-based apartment owner and operator Bell Partners announced that Sarah Young has been appointed to succeed John Tomlinson as chief financial officer, according to a news release .\n\nYoung previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Irving, Texas-based Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of Miami-based homebuilder Lennar. She will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners, which ranked No. 14 on 2025 National Multifamily Housing Council\u2019s Top 50 Manager list with 88,407 units across the U.S.\n\nTomlinson, who plans to retire on Aug. 22, will remain an advisor through the end of 2025 to further support the company and facilitate an orderly transition.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn her new role at Bell, Young will lead the firm\u2019s accounting, corporate finance, tax, financial planning and analysis, legal, compliance and risk management teams. She will also serve on the company\u2019s executive and investment committees, helping guide the company\u2019s strategic direction, business policies and investment decisions.\n\nYoung spent the previous 10 years at Quarterra, where she managed financial operations and strategic planning for the organization and its residential platforms.\n\nYoung also served on Quarterra\u2019s Investment Committee, where she was actively involved in high-level strategic decisions, contributing to the company\u2019s business performance across various platforms, including multifamily, single-family and land finance, according to the release.\n\nHowever, Quarterra has been scaling down its operations over the past couple of years. In a deal that closed last June, New York City-based global investment firm KKR purchased 5,200 units from Quarterra for about $2.1 billion. In September, it sold another 1,400 apartments to QuadReal Property Group, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based global real estate investment, operating and development company.\n\nIn June, New York City-based software provider Alfred and its property management firm, Charlotte-based RKW Residential, merged with Quarterra Living, the apartment operational arm of Quarterra Multifamily. The firm provided roughly 30,000 units to the venture.\n\nSarah Young Retrieved from Bell Partners on July 30, 2025\n\nBefore her tenure at Quarterra, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital, where she managed equity commitments across several funds. She began her career at Ernst & Young LLP.\n\n\u201cSarah Young comes to us with a wealth of experience guiding real estate investment decisions and fund management strategies in increasingly complicated financial arenas,\u201d Dunn said in the news release.\n\nWhile Quarterra has been scaling back, Bell is growing. The firm has been an active buyer of apartments this year, recently purchasing the Montane Apartments, a 400-unit apartment community located in Parker, Colorado, according to a separate news release. It purchased the asset through its Bell Value Add Fund VIII and will rename it Bell Parker Ranch.\n\nIn January, Bell announced it had acquired two properties in Denver and one in Miami on behalf of its Bell Value-Add Fund VIII in separate transactions for a total of $264.3 million.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nOver the past five years, office conversions have garnered significant attention, and it's easy to see why. As more Americans started to work remotely in 2020 and 2021, developers began to look for ways to better utilize that space.\n\nHousing has emerged as a top use, especially as rents have skyrocketed. Office-to-multifamily conversion projects increased from 12,100 units in progress in 2021 to 71,000 units by the beginning of 2025.\n\nHowever, Ryan Sudeck, CEO of Sage Investment Group, believes another type of conversion can be even more effective in addressing affordable housing challenges.\n\nSudeck\u2019s Kirkland, Washington-based firm acquires underutilized, off-market hotels and motels and transforms them into workforce studio apartments. The company now has 27 properties in six states.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the properties were built in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, although we do have some newer properties, a Marriott Residence Inn in Houston that was built in the 2000s,\u201d Sudeck told Multifamily Dive.\n\nSage owns assets in Washington state, Texas and the Carolinas, and plans to expand into Denver and Orlando, Florida. \u201cWe want to make sure we have good population density around the properties,\u201d Sudeck said.\n\nSage, which is delivering 13 conversions in 2025, intends to hold its properties for five years. The firm prefers hotels with exterior corridors because Sudeck believes they allow for easier transport of construction materials and provide greater separation between residents.\n\n\u201cThey feel like they've got their own space,\u201d Sudeck said. \u201cThey also don't smell each other's cooking.\u201d\n\nHere, Sudeck talks with Multifamily Dive about the transaction pipeline for hotel properties, financing those assets and the impacts of tariffs.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMULTIFAMILY DIVE: Are these generally distressed properties that you\u2019re buying?\n\nRYAN SUDECK: That certainly happens. We recently acquired a portfolio where we paid less than 50 cents on the dollar for what it had last transacted for, about three years prior. So we see a lot of distress.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that distress comes about in hospitality. Hotels fall on hard times. They can't afford a property improvement plan to refresh the property, so they drop a tier, and it's a slippery slope. So in most situations, we're buying distress.\n\nRyan Sudeck Permission granted by Sage Investment Group\n\nThere is also a lot of Indian family ownership. They immigrated in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, ran these hotels, and raised their kids. Their kids are well educated now. Now, the mom or dad or grandfather or grandmother moves on from the family business. We find that these are some of the sellers that we also buy from.\n\nWho are you competing with for these properties?\n\nThere aren\u2019t too many groups doing hotel conversions. Among the larger groups still active in this space, there are certainly hotel operators that will upgrade them.\n\nTypically, we can pay more than hotel operators because our business model is to capitalize on the fundamental difference between what a hotel is worth and what a multifamily property is worth. Whereas a hotel operator is constrained by the cap rate of a hospitality asset.\n\nHow many units do you prefer to convert in one property?\n\nWe're looking for something big enough where we can have on-site property management \u2014 usually over 100 units. But we\u2019re not doing more than 200 units because we're typically delivering fully amenitized studio units into the market, and we don't want to deliver too many and oversaturate the market.\n\nWhat financing are you using once these properties are stabilized? Are you using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?\n\nWe have not yet used agency debt as a refinance vehicle. We're planning to probably do that on one of our assets coming up. Typically, our takeout financing is from local banks and credit unions. They love this type of product.\n\nWith our most recent refinance, we secured a 35-year amortization term. Given the significant upgrades we're making to the properties themselves, banks are willing to give us a longer shelf life on the property itself.\n\nHow are you incorporating the kitchens?\n\nThe hotels we buy do not already have kitchens in them. We're installing the kitchens, and we typically include a full-size refrigerator, a full-size range and a microwave. The range obviously comes with a stovetop too. And so they live like a fully amenitized studio unit.\n\nThen we take all the hotel common spaces and trick them out with various amenities, fitness centers, pools, yoga studios, lounges \u2014 areas for folks to form community.\n\nHow are tariffs affecting your business?\n\nOne of our shipments got hit with a tariff of $33,000, but that's across $45 million worth of spend this year. So, it has had a relatively minor impact. There has been a lot less development by and large, so there is a lot more availability from subs.\n\nWe had been buying offshore, and for the year of 2025, we brought some of those relationships onshore at the same prices we were getting internationally. We were able to negotiate that. So that helped mitigate the effect.\n\nWe usually budget for an 11%-ish contingency over our budget. We have three properties that are scheduled to deliver in the next couple of weeks, and we're 1.2% over budget, which is well within our contingency.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.",

        "summary": "**Hotel Conversions Emerge as Effective Affordable Housing Solution**\n\n**Key details:** Sage Investment Group is transforming underutilized hotels into workforce studio apartments, an approach CEO Ryan Sudeck deems more effective for affordable housing than office conversions. The firm currently operates 27 properties across six states, with plans for further expansion into Denver and Orlando. Sage prioritizes acquiring distressed hotels, often at significant discounts, and prefers properties with exterior corridors for operational benefits. They typically seek properties with over 100 units for on-site management, but under 200 to avoid market oversaturation.\n\n**Why it matters:** This strategy provides a potentially more effective solution for affordable housing than the widely discussed office-to-multifamily conversions. Sage's business model allows them to outbid hotel operators by leveraging the value disparity between hospitality and multifamily assets. This challenges the prevailing focus on office conversions as the primary urban repurposing trend and highlights a specialized niche with a distinct competitive advantage in property acquisition and financing.\n\n**The big picture:** The rise of remote work in 2020-2021 led to underutilized office space, prompting developers to explore new uses. Housing became a primary focus due to skyrocketing rents, resulting in a substantial increase in office-to-multifamily conversion projects. Amidst this trend, hotel-to-multifamily conversions are emerging as a distinct and potentially more effective strategy for addressing affordable housing challenges.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Office-to-multifamily conversions rose from 12,100 units in 2021 to 71,000 units by early 2025.\n*   Sage Investment Group owns 27 properties across six states.\n*   The firm is delivering 13 hotel conversions in 2025.\n*   Sage recently acquired a portfolio for less than 50 cents on the dollar of its last transaction price.\n*   A $33,000 tariff hit one shipment across $45 million in spending this year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Ryan Sudeck:** CEO of Sage Investment Group, who advocates hotel-to-apartment conversions for affordable housing.\n*   **Sage Investment Group:** Firm that acquires and converts hotels into workforce studio apartments, owning 27 properties.\n*   **Multifamily Dive:** Publication that conducted the interview with Ryan Sudeck about hotel conversions.\n*   **Fannie Mae:** Government-sponsored enterprise that Sage plans to potentially use for future refinance vehicles.\n*   **Freddie Mac:** Government-sponsored enterprise that Sage plans to potentially use for future refinance vehicles.\n*   **Marriott Residence Inn:** Example of a newer hotel property acquired by Sage in Houston.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Sage Investment Group plans to deliver 13 conversions in 2025.\n*   Three properties are scheduled to deliver in the next couple of weeks.\n*   The firm is planning to use agency debt, like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, on an upcoming asset.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Hotel conversions carve out a profitable niche, tackling affordable housing.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPaper cups are for the first time part of the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s materials specifications list, the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. Graphic Packaging International praised the cups update, calling it \u201ca major milestone in a broader movement to increase awareness and drive greater collection of paper cups in recycling systems,\u201d according to a Monday news release.\n\nReMa's ISRI specifications set standards for the quality of recycled materials and serve as a guide for scrap material buyers' and sellers' transactions. However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nContainerboard producers are being hit with a class-action antitrust lawsuit accusing them of creating a \u201ccartel\u201d and engaging in price collusion to boost profits at the expense of customers, as first reported by Bloomberg Law.\n\nOn Tuesday, Artuso Pastry Foods Corp. filed the complaint in federal court in Illinois against entities including Cascades, Georgia-Pacific, Graphic Packaging International, Greif, International Paper, Packaging Corporation of America, Pratt Industries and Smurfit Westrock over a series of seven price increases from November 2020 to the present .\n\n. Artuso Pastry is requesting that plaintiffs receive treble damages, an amount three times the damages eventually awarded by the court. It also seeks injunctive relief, in which a court orders violating parties to stop taking a particular action, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThis is not the first time major containerboard producers have faced a price collusion class action lawsuit. In one example, Minnesota-based cleaning products company Kleen Products in 2010 brought a suit against nearly 10 containerboard producers, also in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on accusations of conspiring to increase prices and reduce output from 2004 to 2010.\n\nThat case resulted in multiple containerboard companies, including Packaging Corporation of America and International Paper, settling via multimillion-dollar payments, although Georgia-Pacific and WestRock went to court. Many of the defendants in the Kleen Products case are also named in the new lawsuit.\n\nIn this week\u2019s nearly 50-page filing, Artuso Pastry said current containerboard producers and their predecessors have engaged in anticompetitive behavior and price fixing for more than 85 years. It says in the last five years, defendants engaged in \u201cnumerous unprecedented and unjustified price increases, often implemented at the exact same time and for the exact same increase.\u201d This \u201cconspiracy\u201d resulted in customers paying higher prices for containerboard than would have existed in a competitive market, according to the filing.\n\nThis lawsuit stems from Mount Vernon, New York-based Artuso Pastry purchasing containerboard products from WestRock, now Smurfit Westrock, and paying \u201can artificially high price,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nSmurfit Westrock does not comment on pending litigation, but it is aware of the lawsuit and reviewing it, a company spokesperson told Packaging Dive on Wednesday. Georgia-Pacific also emailed a statement: \u201cThese claims against Georgia-Pacific are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend the company.\u201d The other companies Packaging Dive contacted Wednesday did not respond by publication time.\n\nThe plaintiff claims that containerboard prices were relatively stable throughout the 2010s, but have jumped dramatically over the last five years \u2014 33% from November 2020 to September 2022. The lawsuit alleges that no changes occurred to economic conditions such as input costs or demand \u201cthat could plausibly account for the magnitude of the price increases\u201d that the producers implemented.\n\nReasons that producers have cited for the hikes include increased input costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. Some industry observers have questioned the timing of containerboard price hikes during the last two years, citing weak demand and a global oversupply.\n\nPart of the problem is the amount of industry consolidation that has occurred over the last few decades, the lawsuit says, citing that just a handful of companies now control the vast majority of market share, 85%, for containerboard products. It notes numerous major M&A deals in the industry over the last 25 years, including last year\u2019s combination of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, IP\u2019s acquisition of DS Smith in January, and the early July announcement that PCA would buy Greif\u2019s containerboard business. This type of concentration makes the market more susceptible to collusion, according to the plaintiff.\n\nDefendants took a two-year pause on major price increases but resumed in December 2023, the suit says. At that time, numerous manufacturers announced nearly identical price increases for various board grades, set to take effect in January and February. That spring, a cluster of companies announced they would again raise prices in June 2024, with analysts pointing to a leading index only partially recognizing the first increase. More announcements started late in 2024 for price bumps taking effect this year, with more than a dozen manufacturers ultimately becoming part of that movement.\n\nAlthough subtle differences existed in the different companies\u2019 price hikes, \u201cthe lockstep movements further reinforced a repeated pattern of parallel pricing,\u201d the lawsuit says. The plaintiff says containerboard producers\u2019 collusion defies economic logic and goes against their individual self interests.\n\nThe plaintiff further argues that containerboard producers engaged in capacity restrictions, specifically that they used \u201cvalue over volume\u201d strategies and facility closures to restrict volumes. It cites numerous closures by WestRock, International Paper and Greif, along with executives\u2019 repeated public references to \u201cvalue over volume\u201d in recent years.\n\nThe court docket shows Artuso Pastry\u2019s attorneys appeared in court Wednesday. Another document indicates involved parties must jointly provide the judge with a status update by Dec. 17.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** New antitrust lawsuit hits containerboard producers over alleged price collusion.\n\n**Key details:**\nArtuso Pastry Foods Corp. filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against major containerboard producers, including International Paper and Smurfit Westrock, on Tuesday. The complaint accuses these companies of creating a \u201ccartel\u201d and engaging in price collusion, resulting in a series of seven price increases from November 2020 to the present. Artuso Pastry is requesting treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The lawsuit alleges containerboard prices jumped 33% from November 2020 to September 2022 without justifiable economic reasons. Defendants are also accused of capacity restrictions and using \u201cvalue over volume\u201d strategies.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis lawsuit challenges the prevailing pricing environment in the containerboard industry, alleging that significant price increases since November 2020 were not economically justified by factors like input costs or demand. The plaintiff claims that industry consolidation, with a few companies controlling 85% of the market, makes the sector susceptible to collusion. This information might challenge the current consensus by suggesting that recent price stability and hikes are a result of anticompetitive practices rather than market forces. If the claims are proven, it could significantly alter the industry's competitive landscape and pricing power.\n\n**The big picture:**\nMajor containerboard producers have faced similar price collusion class-action lawsuits in the past, such as the 2010 Kleen Products case which resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements for some defendants. The current nearly 50-page filing claims a history of anticompetitive behavior and price fixing by current and predecessor companies for more than 85 years. The lawsuit alleges \"numerous unprecedented and unjustified price increases\" that were often implemented at the exact same time. Industry observers have also questioned the timing of recent containerboard price hikes, citing weak demand and global oversupply.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Seven:** Number of alleged price increases from November 2020 to the present.\n*   **33%:** Increase in containerboard prices from November 2020 to September 2022.\n*   **85%:** Market share controlled by a handful of companies for containerboard products.\n*   **85+ years:** Alleged duration of anticompetitive behavior and price fixing by producers.\n*   **2 years:** Duration of a pause on major price increases before resuming in December 2023.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Artuso Pastry Foods Corp.:** Plaintiff that filed the class-action antitrust lawsuit against containerboard producers.\n*   **Cascades:** Named as a defendant in the new class-action antitrust lawsuit regarding price collusion.\n*   **Georgia-Pacific:** Named as a defendant in the new lawsuit; claims are without merit and the company will defend.\n*   **Graphic Packaging International:** Named as a defendant in the new class-action antitrust lawsuit regarding price collusion.\n*   **Greif:** Named as a defendant in the new lawsuit; cited for facility closures and is an M&A target.\n*   **International Paper:** Named as a defendant in the new lawsuit; previously settled similar claims and acquired DS Smith.\n*   **Packaging Corporation of America (PCA):** Named as a defendant in the new lawsuit; previously settled similar claims and will buy Greif's business.\n*   **Pratt Industries:** Named as a defendant in the new class-action antitrust lawsuit regarding price collusion.\n*   **Smurfit Westrock:** Named as a defendant in the new lawsuit; formed last year and is reviewing the litigation.\n*   **Kleen Products:** Cleaning products company that brought a similar containerboard antitrust suit in 2010.\n*   **Smurfit Kappa:** Combined with WestRock last year, mentioned in the context of industry M&A.\n*   **DS Smith:** Company acquired by International Paper in January, mentioned in the context of industry M&A.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Involved parties must jointly provide the judge with a status update by December 17.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nContainerboard giants face renewed legal scrutiny over alleged price fixing.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUpcoming negotiations in Geneva meant to finalize a global agreement to end plastic pollution will have important implications for recycling supply chains, business innovations and brands\u2019 voluntary plastic reduction commitments, said speakers during a Tuesday roundtable hosted by the Solid Waste Association of North America in Washington, D.C.\n\nSpeakers from WM, the Circular Action Alliance, SC Johnson and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they are closely monitoring the upcoming round of Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings that will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSome of these outcomes of INC-5.2 may impact plastic production, design and available end markets, which is really crucial,\u201d said Amy Lestition Burke, SWANA\u2019s CEO.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear just what direction this round of negotiations may take, Burke said waste and packaging stakeholders are watching for major movement on topics such as proposed extended producer responsibility models or proposed limits on overall plastic production. Those two facets could meaningfully shape recycling supply chains and influence brands\u2019 packaging design decisions, she said.\n\nThe Geneva negotiations are a continuation of a long-term discussion between global governments and stakeholders that started in 2022 and is meant to develop an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution. The goal was to complete the process by the end of 2024, but negotiators did not reach an agreement at what was supposed to be the final meeting in Busan, South Korea, in November.\n\nThough stakeholders from waste and packaging groups previously expressed frustration and disappointment that the negotiations have dragged into 2025, speakers at the SWANA event said a plastics treaty is nonetheless worth the time and effort.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can all agree on is that the waste and resource resource management industry is key to this, and it is a solution,\u201d Lestition Burke said.\n\nChuck Chaitovitz, vice president of environmental affairs and sustainability for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the ideal plastics treaty outcome would offer a \u201cglobal framework that drives country ambition\u201d while helping to provide \u201ceffective collection and reuse systems and end markets where we would have a circular economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber sent a letter in June to the U.S. State Department urging the federal government to continue participating in plastics treaty negotiations by advocating for an end to plastic pollution, but not an end to plastic use altogether. \u201cAn effective agreement would provide global economic opportunities,\u201d the Chamber wrote.\n\nA global plastics treaty must include investments in infrastructure that can boost recycling in both developed and developing countries, but those investments must also ensure long-term end markets for recycled materials, said Ganesh Nagarajan, senior director of plastics for WM.\n\n\u201cThese investments need to happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about having a framework or an agreement in place, but you need to really have those sustainable end markets behind it.\u201d\n\nBolstering end markets could help raise recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials such as plastic film and flexibles, he said. WM is currently working on some pilot programs to ramp up recycling for these materials, but is so far only recycling the materials customers are accidentally putting in their bins. \u201cOnly 2% is recycled today, so that's a large untapped opportunity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a robust and predictable end market\u201d before telling customers that such materials are allowed in curbside bins.\n\nMany global brands are already working on voluntary recycled content goals that are driving the market for recycled materials, said Jeff Bezzo, plastics sustainability leader at SC Johnson. But voluntary actions alone won\u2019t cut it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've made some great progress,\u201d Bezzo said, noting that 25% of the company's packaging globally is made with recycled content. \u201cWe'd like to do more. It is hard to be competitive when you're doing voluntary actions versus everybody rowing together in the same direction. That means the brand owners, the waste haulers, the reclaimers, all the way through the entire circle.\u201d\n\nSC Johnson is also a founding member of the Circular Action Alliance, the producer responsibility organization that manages extended producer responsibility programs for six U.S. states.\n\n\u201cWe see EPR as a key legislative tool to expand recycling, because most municipalities, let's face it, have stretched budgets,\u201d he said. Better funding mechanisms means more collection, better MRF infrastructure and more developed end markets, he said.\n\nBezzo sees EPR as an important tool for global treaty discussions, too. \u201cIn a global treaty, we'd love to see EPR as part of that design guideline, so manufacturers around the world have some certainty around what packaging they should be putting into the market, so it has its best chance to get recycled,\u201d he said.\n\nFor recycled content discussions, Bezzo said it\u2019s important for brands to see PCR content requirements \u201cratchet up over time.\u201d That would allow recycled plastics suppliers time to ensure they have viable end markets, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber recognizes that \u201cthere is a role to play for EPR in a global agreement,\u201d Chaitovitz said. However, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to consider these issues globally\u201d when U.S. stakeholders alone are still grappling with key aspects of EPR programs, such as PRO funding mechanisms and decisions about who gets to be in the PRO. \u201cAlso, we need to decide who gets the materials back, both those in the recycling space who want to recycle it, but then those brand owners and others that want to reuse that material to continue to make valuable products.\u201d\n\nFor WM, EPR could be an important driver as long as it has built-in demand drivers, such as minimum recycled content thresholds, Nagarajan said.\n\nPrevious INC meeting discussions included debates over whether to enforce virgin plastics production caps, and speakers at the SWANA event said they\u2019ll be watching to see what direction those discussions take in Geneva.\n\nBezzo said brands should already be reducing virgin demand. Such virgin reductions can be advanced by PCR requirements and other drivers like product lightweighting and reuse and refill programs.\n\nConsumers are already expressing an interest in products made with less plastic, Chaitovitz added, \u201cbut it's the market that needs to decide.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Global Plastic Treaty Talks Resume, Shaping Recycling and Brand Commitments\n\n**Key details:** Upcoming global plastic pollution negotiations in Geneva (Aug. 5-14) will impact recycling supply chains, business innovations, and brands' voluntary commitments. These talks, known as INC-5.2, could shape plastic production, design, and end markets. Key topics include extended producer responsibility (EPR) models and potential limits on overall plastic production. The goal is a legally binding agreement, though negotiations extended beyond the original 2024 deadline into 2025.\n\n**Why it matters:** The negotiations could profoundly shape recycling supply chains and influence brands' packaging design decisions globally. Industry players emphasize that a unified, global framework, including investments in infrastructure and robust end markets, is essential. This challenges the current consensus where voluntary actions by brands, though progressive, are deemed insufficient for widespread change, making it difficult for competitive companies to act alone. A legally binding agreement is seen as critical to drive collective industry action beyond individual voluntary commitments.\n\n**The big picture:** These Geneva negotiations are a continuation of global government and stakeholder discussions that began in 2022. The long-term goal is to develop an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution, originally aiming for completion by late 2024. Despite frustrations over delays pushing talks into 2025, industry participants view the treaty as essential. Stakeholders like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seek a global framework that drives ambition while supporting effective collection, reuse systems, and circular economy end markets.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Aug. 5-14:** Dates for the upcoming Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) meetings in Geneva.\n*   **2022:** Year global discussions to end plastic pollution began.\n*   **2024:** Original target year for completing the international agreement.\n*   **25%:** SC Johnson's global packaging made with recycled content.\n*   **2%:** Percentage of hard-to-recycle plastic film and flexibles currently recycled by WM.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA):** Hosted a roundtable discussion on plastic pollution negotiations in Washington, D.C.\n*   **WM:** Waste management company whose senior director emphasized investments for long-term end markets for recycled materials.\n*   **Circular Action Alliance:** Producer responsibility organization managing extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs in six U.S. states.\n*   **SC Johnson:** Consumer goods brand with 25% recycled content in global packaging, seeking unified industry action.\n*   **U.S. Chamber of Commerce:** Urged U.S. government participation in treaty talks, advocating for economic opportunities.\n*   **Amy Lestition Burke:** SWANA's CEO, stated INC-5.2 outcomes could impact plastic production, design, and end markets.\n*   **Chuck Chaitovitz:** U.S. Chamber of Commerce VP, discussed ideal treaty outcomes for global collection and reuse systems.\n*   **Ganesh Nagarajan:** WM Senior Director of Plastics, stressed immediate investments in infrastructure and sustainable end markets.\n*   **Jeff Bezzo:** SC Johnson Plastics Sustainability Leader, noted voluntary actions need global support and sees EPR as key.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The next round of Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings (INC-5.2) will occur Aug. 5-14 in Geneva, Switzerland.\n*   Watch for major movement on proposed extended producer responsibility models or limits on overall plastic production.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Global plastic treaty negotiations could redefine recycling and packaging, moving beyond voluntary efforts.",

The Federal Trade Commission took action against BlueSnap and its former CEO last year over processing payments for deceptive and fraudulent companies.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   BlueSnap had raised at least $80 million.\n*   BlueSnap at one point had about 200 employees.\n*   Fintech venture capital firms contributed $50 million to BlueSnap in 2014.\n*   The combined entity will process payments in 47 countries.\n*   The combined entity will process payments in some 100 different currencies.\n*   BlueSnap focused on clients with between $2 million and $1 billion in annual revenue.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Payroc WorldAccess:** Fast-expanding payments processor and acquirer, made its second acquisition this month.\n*   **BlueSnap:** Payments orchestration firm acquired by Payroc, focused on the middle market with global payment capabilities.\n*   **Jim Oberman:** Payroc CEO, stated the acquisition expands global footprint and capabilities for customers and partners.\n*   **Henry Helgeson:** BlueSnap CEO, said joining Payroc provides customers direct access to acquiring relationships.\n*   **LedgerPay:** Cloud-based payments player, Payroc's other acquisition announced this month.\n*   **Great Hill Partners:** Fintech venture capital firm that contributed to BlueSnap's investments in 2014.\n*   **Parthenon Capital Partners:** Fintech venture capital firm that contributed to BlueSnap's investments in 2014.\n*   **Ralph Dangelmaier:** Former BlueSnap CEO, exited after FTC action against the company for processing fraudulent payments.\n*   **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** Federal agency that took action against BlueSnap and its former CEO in May 2024.\n*   **Edible Arrangements:** Gift company mentioned as a BlueSnap customer.\n*   **Jamf:** Software company mentioned as a BlueSnap customer.\n*   **MyHeritage:** Online genealogy company mentioned as a BlueSnap customer.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nPayroc's latest acquisition boosts global reach and service offerings significantly.",

No witness should be deposed more than once, U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in New York City ruled last month .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe complaint alleges that Visa, the biggest U.S. card network, operates an illegal monopoly in the market for debit card payments, and \u201cwields its dominance, enormous scale, and centrality\u201d to impose agreements on merchants and banks that exclude potential competitors from debit processing, the Justice Department said when it filed the complaint.\n\nThe answer from Visa, which also routes credit card transactions, to the lawsuit came about five weeks after the company lost its bid to have the case dismissed.\n\nThe Justice Department brought the lawsuit in September under then-Attorney General Merrick Garland during the Biden administration.\n\nKoeltl denied Visa\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit on June 24, finding that the government\u2019s allegations were plausible and that a dismissal would be premature. In its filing Thursday, Visa again asked Koeltl to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and enter judgement in its favor.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Visa also struck agreements with various fintech firms to prevent them from entering debit market competition.\n\n\u201cVisa has no agreements that pay competitors not to compete or agreements that pay potential competitors not to develop alternatives to debit card networks or adopt technologies to disintermediate debit card networks,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\nSan Francisco-based Visa handles more than 60% of U.S. debit card transactions on its network, collecting more than $7 billion annually in processing fees, according to the federal government\u2019s complaint. Mastercard is a distant second in the market, with less than a quarter of the debit-processing market, the lawsuit said.\n\nVisa said its contracts with issuers and acquirers \u201care pro-competitive discounting arrangements, are reflective of common industry practices, are responsive to demands from sophisticated customers\u201d and have not stymied competition.\n\nThe case is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.",

The company stated its conduct was procompetitive, had legitimate business justifications, and its practices were reasonably justified. Visa also denied having agreements to pay competitors not to compete or develop alternatives to debit networks.\n\n**Why it matters:** The Justice Department's complaint alleges Visa operates an illegal monopoly and imposes exclusionary agreements. Visa's detailed denial directly challenges these core government allegations, asserting its practices are pro-competitive and common industry practice. This refutation suggests Visa is prepared for a lengthy legal battle, potentially shifting the market's view on the strength of the DOJ's claims.\n\n**The big picture:** The Justice Department brought this lawsuit in September under Attorney General Merrick Garland during the Biden administration. The complaint accuses Visa, the largest U.S. card network, of operating an illegal monopoly in the debit card payments market. A judge previously denied Visa's bid to dismiss the case, finding the government's allegations plausible.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Visa handles more than 60% of U.S. debit card transactions.\n*   Visa collects more than $7 billion annually in processing fees from debit transactions.\n*   Mastercard holds less than a quarter of the debit-processing market.\n*   Visa lost its bid to dismiss the case approximately five weeks before filing its response.\n*   The fact discovery process in the case is set to end March 17, 2026.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Visa:** Filed its formal response, denying claims of an illegal monopoly in the U.S. debit card market.\n*   **U.S. Department of Justice:** Filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa, alleging an illegal debit card monopoly.\n*   **U.S. District Judge John Koeltl:** Denied Visa's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, ruling its allegations were plausible.\n*   **Merrick Garland:** Was the Attorney General when the Justice Department filed the initial lawsuit.\n*   **Mastercard:** Is a distant second in the U.S. debit-processing market, behind Visa.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The fact discovery process in the case is scheduled to end March 17, 2026.\n*   Expert witness discovery in the case is scheduled to end August 7.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Visa strongly defends its business model against a major federal antitrust challenge.",

Zelle has begun funding a series of free workshops in conjunction with the national non-profit group Consumer Action.\n\n\u201cWe train the trainers and then they go out and work in their local communities,\u201d Zelle General Manager Denise Leonhard said in a July interview.\n\nZelle is a digital payment network used by consumers and businesses to send and receive money.\n\nThe community leaders and groups who will attend the workshops include union leaders and advocacy organizations as well as groups that work with the elderly, Leonhard said.\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Early Warning Services\n\nThe sessions will also include groups that work with people who speak Chinese and Spanish, Consumer Action Executive Director Anna Flores said in a July interview.\n\n\"We've been doing this for a number of years,\" Flores said. The organization connects with community leaders from underserved populations \"and we train them on consumer protection issues, mostly in the financial services space.\"\n\nThe difference now is that the workshops organized in conjunction with Zelle will focus entirely on scams and fraud, she said.\n\nConsumer Action connected with Zelle because both organizations are part of the Aspen Institute, which has a national task force on preventing fraud and scams, Flores said. A meeting of that task force is where an EWS representative first approached Flores, she said.\n\nThe first workshop was held in New York City on July 22 and more workshops are planned in Los Angeles in September and Scottsdale, Arizona in December, according to an Early Warnings Services news release. An undetermined city in North Carolina will also hold a workshop in the first quarter of next year, Flores said.\n\nThe gatherings are intended to educate community leaders on spotting red flags that can identify fraudsters and scammers so they can better educate populations that are particularly vulnerable to fraud, such as the elderly, Flores said.\n\nZelle\u2019s parent, EWS, is owned by seven big banks. It has recently added hundreds of smaller community banks to its network.\n\nExecutives from EWS and the owner banks have appeared before Senate committee panels to explain what the service is doing to prevent fraud, congressional investigations have found that Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams and news outlets have reported that the payment service allowed fraud to proliferate.\n\nMore than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud, an Early Warning Services spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201dThe fact is scams don\u2019t start on Zelle, they start with criminals manipulating people long before dollars move,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe real threat isn\u2019t the payment method. It\u2019s the criminals \u2013 both in the U.S. and increasingly in foreign countries \u2013 exploiting American through texts, DMs and online marketplace scams.\u201d\n\nThe company helped organize the workshops because use of the platform is on the rise, Leonhard said, noting that payment volume on Zelle exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n\nThe four initial workshops are offered free of charge because of Zelle\u2019s financial contribution, Flores said. The company and the group hope to schedule more sessions and other cities in the future.\n\nEarly Warning Services recently pitched Zelle to the U.S. Treasury Department as a viable option for sending money to taxpayers as the federal government considers how to end its use of paper checks.",

Zelle, an EWS peer-to-peer payment service, is funding these free workshops. The workshops, a new focus for Consumer Action, aim to educate vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those speaking Chinese and Spanish. The first session took place in New York City, with others scheduled for Los Angeles, Scottsdale, and an undetermined city in North Carolina.\n\n**Why it matters:** Zelle has faced significant criticism from consumer advocates and lawmakers for purportedly allowing fraud to proliferate on its platform, with congressional investigations citing hundreds of millions in user losses. This initiative indicates Zelle's direct response to these concerns. The company contends that \"scams don\u2019t start on Zelle\" but with criminals manipulating people beforehand, suggesting the payment method is not the real threat. This challenges the prevailing view that Zelle's platform itself is a primary cause of widespread fraud.\n\n**The big picture:** Zelle is a digital payment network widely used by consumers and businesses, recently exceeding $1 trillion in payment volume for the first time in 2024. Its parent company, Early Warning Services (EWS), is owned by seven large banks and has expanded its network to include hundreds of smaller community banks. The company has been under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and consumer groups regarding fraud on its platform. This new initiative is part of an ongoing effort by Zelle to address these fraud concerns and educate users.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   More than 99.95% of Zelle transactions do not involve a report of a scam or fraud.\n*   Zelle payment volume exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in 2024.\n*   Congressional investigations found Zelle users lost hundreds of millions of dollars to fraud and scams.\n*   Zelle's parent, EWS, is owned by seven big banks.\n*   Four initial workshops are offered free of charge due to Zelle's financial contribution.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Early Warning Services (EWS):** Parent company of Zelle, co-organizing workshops to combat scams.\n*   **Consumer Action:** Non-profit partnering with EWS to train community leaders on fraud prevention.\n*   **Zelle:** Peer-to-peer payment service funding and co-organizing workshops amid fraud scrutiny.\n*   **Denise Leonhard:** Zelle General Manager, discussed the training program and increasing platform usage.\n*   **Anna Flores:** Consumer Action Executive Director, explained workshop focus and collaboration origins.\n*   **Aspen Institute:** Connected Consumer Action and EWS through its national task force on fraud.\n*   **U.S. Treasury Department:** Pitched Zelle as a viable option for sending money to taxpayers.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Additional workshops are planned in Los Angeles in September and Scottsdale, Arizona in December.\n*   An undetermined city in North Carolina will hold a workshop in the first quarter of next year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Zelle launches workshops to counter fraud concerns, defend platform amid scrutiny.",

        "summary_text": "Digital payments pioneer PayPal Holdings has begun a \u201clarge-scale initiative\u201d to update its \u201cexisting technology infrastructure\u201d at an estimated cost of as much as $300 million, the company said.\n\nThe effort is expected to occur over 18 to 42 months and resulted in a $95 million charge during the second quarter, including for employee severance and benefits costs, according to a PayPal quarterly filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The workforce reductions associated with the plan are expected to be completed by 2027, the filing said.\n\nIt\u2019s a major \u201cexistential\u201d technology upgrade for a company that\u2019s considered the \u201cgrand-daddy\u201d of the fintech industry, TD Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin said in an interview. It\u2019s a part of providing the technology support for their new initiatives and re-accelerating growth, he said, referring to plans laid out at a February meeting with investors and analysts by PayPal CEO Alex Chriss and other executives.\n\n\u201cLarge organizations need modern technology, and that's a component of this,\u201d Bergin explained in a Thursday interview. \u201cSo a lot of this has to do with making sure they are on the most modern technology, and it is also about consolidating disparate systems behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nThe company laid out the benefits it\u2019s seeking by way of the restructuring in its quarterly filing. \u201cManagement undertook a large-scale initiative (the \u2018Q2 2025 Plan\u2019) to re-engineer our existing technology infrastructure to improve scalability, reduce network latency, decrease operational costs, and optimize our workforce,\u201d the filing said.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Jose, California-based company declined to comment on the workforce reduction beyond the quarterly filing, which didn\u2019t specify how many employees will be cut.\n\nThe restructuring was mentioned only briefly during a Tuesday webcast with analysts to discuss the company\u2019s second-quarter financial results.\n\n\u201cYou'll also see in our (second-quarter) materials that we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $92 million,\u201d PayPal\u2019s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, told analysts during the webcast, referencing a non-GAAP figure. \u201cThese costs are related to workforce actions and the key tech transformation initiatives that we discussed in our investor day,\u201d she said.\n\nChriss, who took the top post in September 2023, has replaced much of the company\u2019s management team and set a new strategic course since taking over from Dan Schulman, who struggled to expand the company\u2019s business after a temporary benefit from COVID-19 e-commerce activity.\n\nThe three-year initiative will \u201cre-engineer infrastructure, streamline operations and exit certain data centers as we unify platforms and migrate more to cloud-based solutions,\u201d Miller said. Benefits of the overhaul will include increased speed, more flexibility in operations, better data utilization and increased scalability, she added.\n\nBased on the quarterly disclosure, the company expects to absorb as much as $300 million in overall cost reductions under the restructuring plan over time. Overall, PayPal forecast $90 million to $100 million in employee severance costs; $40 million to $60 million in accelerated depreciation expense; and other costs of $110 million to $140 million related to the initiative, the filing said.\n\nSome of the other costs are related to the re-engineering work, migration to cloud-based software expense, contractor costs, consulting fees, prepaid software expense and maintenance costs, the filing said. Still, the plan is still developing and the cost estimates could change, PayPal noted.\n\nThe restructuring is also designed to allow the company to better compete with a slew of fintechs entering the payments arena. The current PayPal management team is showing \u201cmore urgency in ultimately modernizing the company because if you don't it's going to be much more difficult in to compete with digital, native players built on stacks today,\u201d Bergin said.\n\nDespite some macroeconomic headwinds this year, including related to U.S. tariffs, the company\u2019s PayPal namesake payments business for merchants, its Braintree offering for larger businesses and Venmo peer-to-peer system continued to expand.\n\nThe company\u2019s second-quarter payments volume rose 6%, or 5% on a foreign exchange neutral basis, including 45%-plus growth in its Venmo volume and 20%-plus growth in buy now, pay later payments volume, the earnings report showed.\n\nSecond-quarter net income rose 12% over the year-ago period to $1.26 billion as revenue climbed 5% to $8.29 billion, including a 20% jump in revenue from Venmo, PayPal said.\n\nSecond-quarter sales and administrative expense dropped 19% to $461 million from a year ago, according to the earnings report, likely reflecting the smaller workforce. Those costs typically include labor expenses.\n\nAs of the end of last year, PayPal had about 24,400 employees worldwide, including about 8,900 in the U.S., according to the company\u2019s annual filing with the SEC in February.\n\nPayPal also noted a \u201cworkforce reduction\u201d that began in the first quarter related to a new regulation in an unidentified international market, saying in the quarterly filing that it resulted in costs for the first half of the year of $36 million.\n\nRestructuring and related costs have been a reality for the company for the past two years. While the overall \u201crestructuring and other\u201d charge for the second quarter this year was 3% higher at $116 million relative to the same quarter last year, PayPal\u2019s $182 million expense for the first half of this year was 44% lower than for the first half of 2024, according to the filing.",

        "summary_text": "Shareholders of Wise voted overwhelmingly Monday to move the U.K.-based money transfer company\u2019s primary stock listing to New York from London.\n\nThe vote was not without controversy, however. The vote on relisting Wise was bundled alongside a measure that lets Class B shareholders in the company retain \u201cgolden share\u201d supervoting powers for 10 more years.\n\nUnder Wise policy, Class B shares, owned by the company\u2019s longtime investors, are worth nine votes apiece, while Class A shares are worth one. But the Class B voting power was limited to five years after the company went public. That debut came in 2021, so golden shares were due to expire next year.\n\nCoupling the two measures drew backlash from one of the fintech\u2019s co-founders, Taavet Hinrikus, who urged shareholders last week to reject the relisting, on the thought the golden share extension would give too much power to his former business partner, Wise CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann.\n\n\u201cEvery CEO would like to have special rights forever. Every shareholder says they should not exist,\u201d Hinrikus said, according to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe question is how do you impose time limits, so everyone feels good, and how do you do it transparently?\u201d\n\nAs it stands, K\u00e4\u00e4rmann owns an 18% stake in Wise but controls just less than 50% of the votes in the company because of his Class B shares. Hinrikus, by comparison, owns 5.1% of Wise\u2019s shares.\n\nWise asserted in June that moving its primary listing to the U.S. would draw retail and institutional investors, increase its liquidity and perhaps boost its valuation, currently around $17 billion.\n\nBut K\u00e4\u00e4rmann remains cautious that outside forces may pressure Wise to increase fees as a method to boost earnings, Bloomberg reported, citing sources who have worked with the CEO.\n\nPerhaps another concern is that activist investors might push Wise to pay dividends. The company\u2019s technology may also draw interest from an acquiring bank.\n\nHinrikus, meanwhile, accused Wise of trying to bury the detail that the relisting vote would also include the supervoting extension. (The first mention of the supervoting measure came on page 10 of the proposal Wise sent to its investors.)\n\nThe supervoting measure was hidden so well, Hinrikus argued, that proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services didn\u2019t mention it on first pass. Each later issued an addendum.\n\n\u201cGlass Lewis believes multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights are typically not in the best interests of common shareholders,\u201d the proxy adviser wrote in a report July 22, adding it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Glass Lewis ultimately advised Wise shareholders to back the move.\n\nWise needed a majority of Class A and B shareholders to approve the measure \u2013 with the caveat that a \u201csupermajority\u201d of investors holding 75% of the value of the company\u2019s stock must vote in favor of the relisting proposal for it to pass.\n\nIt received support from holders of more than 90% of its Class A stock and nearly 85% of its Class B shares.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that our owners have overwhelmingly approved the proposal, giving us a strong mandate to proceed,\u201d Wise Chair David Wells said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe appreciate the extensive engagement with our owners. With this high level of support, our focus is firmly on moving forward.\u201d\n\nWise plans to keep a secondary listing in the U.K. A court in the country must also give its blessing on the move.\n\nStill, the dual measure draws skepticism from some observers of the space.\n\n\u201cWhenever anyone wants to extend dual-class shares for 10 years, there are legitimate concerns about their motivations,\u201d Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIs this entrenchment, or is this innocuous?\u201d",

        "summary": "**Wise shareholders approve US listing amid \"golden share\" controversy.**\n\n**Key details:** Wise shareholders overwhelmingly approved moving the company's primary stock listing to New York from London. This vote controversially bundled the relisting with an extension of \"golden share\" supervoting powers for Class B shareholders for an additional 10 years. Class B shares, held by longtime investors, carry nine votes apiece compared to one for Class A, and their special rights were set to expire next year. The proposal passed with strong support from both Class A and Class B shareholders.\n\n**Why it matters:** The move aims to increase Wise's liquidity, attract investors, and potentially boost its $17 billion valuation. However, the accompanying \"golden share\" extension grants significant power to Class B shareholders for another decade, raising corporate governance concerns. This extended dual-class structure might challenge the view that such moves are always purely for broad shareholder benefit, as it potentially entrenches existing management control. CEO K\u00e4\u00e4rmann also expressed caution about external pressure to increase fees or pay dividends, which could impact the company's operational strategy.\n\n**The big picture:** Wise is a U.K.-based money transfer company that went public in 2021. Its Class B \"golden share\" supervoting rights were originally set to expire next year, five years after its debut. The recent shareholder vote bundled the proposed primary listing move to the U.S. with a controversial extension of these Class B supervoting powers for 10 more years. This coupling led to backlash from co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, who argued it would give too much power to CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **10 years:** Extension of Class B \"golden share\" supervoting powers.\n*   **9:1:** Ratio of votes per Class B share to Class A share.\n*   **$17 billion:** Wise's current valuation.\n*   **18% stake / <50% votes:** CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann's ownership stake and voting control.\n*   **>90% Class A, ~85% Class B:** Shareholder approval rates for the proposal.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Wise:** U.K.-based money transfer company moving its primary stock listing from London to New York.\n*   **Taavet Hinrikus:** Co-founder who opposed the bundled vote due to concerns over extended supervoting powers.\n*   **Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann:** Wise CEO, whose Class B shares give him significant voting control for 10 more years.\n*   **David Wells:** Wise Chair, who stated satisfaction with the strong shareholder mandate for the move.\n*   **Glass Lewis:** Proxy adviser initially concerned about multi-class structures, later advised shareholders to back the move.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Wise plans to maintain a secondary listing in the U.K.\n*   A U.K. court must provide its approval for the listing move.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Wise secures US listing and entrenched founder control despite governance concerns.",

Block plans to roll out the feature to all users in the coming months, the company said in a news release Tuesday. The feature will let users contribute money from their Cash App accounts or rival digital wallets from Apple and Google.\n\nOakland, California-based Block is likely making a play for Apple and Google customers by allowing that interoperability, KBW analyst Vasu Govil said in an interview.\n\n\"If an Apple Pay user sees this functionality being used with Cash App and likes what they see, they might decide they want to try Cash App,\u201d she said.

By contrast, gross profit for the app nearly doubled for the first quarter of 2024, relative to the year-earlier period.\n\nThe pooling feature could be a way to get more customers onto the app, but it will take some time before users of competing payment services see the value in Cash App, Govil said. \u201cI don't think this will be a meaningful contributor to profit growth\u201d in the short-term, she said.\n\nThe launch is part of an effort to improve customers\u2019 financial journey, a Google spokesperson said in an email.

Crucially, the feature supports contributions not only from Cash App accounts but also from rival digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

The fresh funding gave Ramp a $22.5 billion valuation.\n\n\u201cSo, why are we raising another $500 million? (just 45 days after our last round)?\u201d Ramp\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Eric Glyman, wrote Wednesday in a blog post explaining the startup\u2019s reasoning on capital. \u201cBecause we\u2019re at a unique moment in finance.

The bots are built for \u201creal-world policy enforcement, fraud detection, and policy improvement,\u201d Ramp said in a prior July 9 blog post.\n\nNew York-based Ramp \u2013 like rivals that include Airbase, BILL and Brex \u2013 offers corporate clients tools that handle tasks such as expense management, accounting, travel and procurement along with corporate cards and software to analyze and optimize corporate spending.\n\nRamp has raised $1.9 billion in venture funding since it was established in 2019, according to the release.\n\nInvestment firm Iconiq Capital led the funding round, along with the firms that invested in June and seven new investors that included Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, the wife of Apple\u2019s late co-founder; GV (Google Ventures); and T. Rowe Price Associates.\n\n\u201cWe believe Ramp is leading in agentic AI and setting the standard for what AI-powered finance can look like in the coming years \u2013 at a defining inflection point in their journey,\u201d Roy Luo, an Iconiq general partner, said Wednesday in a statement emailed by a Ramp spokesperson.\n\nAI agents will assume the \u201cbusywork\u201d of many finance functions in 2026, Glyman wrote, using the example of a traditional approval process for an employee\u2019s $5 latte. The manual process requires 14 minutes and $20 of human intervention cost for questions, approvals, audits and coding of the coffee expense.\n\n\u201cScale that across 2,000 swipes a month and your finance team is trapped in an endless loop of micro-decisions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn 2027, finance AI will begin handling contracts, which traditionally have flowed from one person to another in corporate procurement, from a vendor to the procurement department, then to legal and finance, ending with a purchase order and the company\u2019s payment, Glyman predicted.\n\nAI agents will start handling these workflows in a parallel process, with procurement schedules reduced from a week or more to minutes, according to Glyman. \u201cWhy can\u2019t legal, risk, and procurement copilots review the same request at once?\u201d he wrote.\n\nRamp is \u201can exciting addition,\u201d to GV\u2019s fintech portfolio, a partner at the investment firm, Elena Sakach, wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\n\u201cCore finance operations remain stuck in decades-old legacy systems,\u201d Sakach wrote. \u201cRamp is changing this by executing on the everyday well.

        "summary_text": "Visa, the largest U.S. card network, expects to target its stablecoin strategy to certain markets and uses as the digital currencies become a reality around the world.\n\nVisa CEO Ryan McInerney fleshed out the card network giant\u2019s stablecoin approach during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday, explaining how it makes sense for the company to pay special attention to the viability of stablecoins in certain markets.\n\nIn particular, Visa\u2019s efforts to offer stablecoin options may be best suited to emerging market economies where it\u2019s had more difficulty digitizing payments, he said.\n\n\u201cOn the emerging markets use cases, the bulk of those markets around the world are very cash rich markets \u2014 the bulk of those markets around the world are markets where we haven't been as successful digitizing cash as we have in more mature markets,\u201d McInerney told analysts on the webcast in discussing stablecoin opportunities.\n\nSpecifically, he foresees options for shifting payments in stablecoins to transactions on the networks\u2019 array of credit and debit cards in such markets. \u201cTo the extent that stablecoins get adopted in a broad-based way by both consumers and businesses\u201d in such emerging markets, \u201cI think that could accelerate our progress digitizing consumer payments, small business and commercial payments in those markets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Visa strategy on stablecoins is surfacing just days after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act, which begins to create a regulatory framework for the digital assets that are pegged to a currency or commodity that is considered a stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar. While stablecoins are still rarely used in commerce, companies are beginning to see them as potentially useful particularly for cross-border transactions.\n\nStablecoins are often seen as an alternative or bridge to cryptocurrencies. With the proliferation of hundreds of different cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins emerged as alternatives to those more volatile digital assets.\n\nMcInerney expects stablecoins could bolster the company\u2019s cross-border and business-to-business payments plays to make inroads in areas where it hasn\u2019t before. He specifically cited the market for remittances, which are payments sent by migrants working in certain countries, often the U.S., to friends and family in other countries.\n\n\u201cWhether it's remittances or B2B money movement, those are enormous (total addressable markets) that we're still relatively low, in terms of our penetration of those as well,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThat's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to expand and accelerate our growth.\u201d\n\nThe company has generally relied on its international Visa Direct payments network to offer remittances services, but in some cases it hasn\u2019t been as effective, McInerney acknowledged.\n\n\u201cFor example, sending money from a Visa card to a bank account in an emerging market, we're reliant on local banking infrastructure, so in these types of use cases, stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions,\u201d McInerney explained on the webcast.\n\nThe San Francisco-based card network is now testing the use of stablecoins in some such markets versus its other fiat money movement options and pinpointing where the digital assets are most effective, the CEO said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we've got a pretty good sense on which corridors we can provide, faster money movement, cheaper money movement, which ultimately is value, I think, that will accrue both to end users and to our clients,\u201d McInerney said.\n\nThe CEO didn\u2019t specify which markets are being used for those experiments. A spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a question seeking additional information.\n\n\u201cThere is a real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors, and as the largest money movement platform around the world, we're going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end-users.\n\nVisa reported its fiscal third-quarter net income for the month ended June 30, rose 8% over the year-ago period to $5.3 billion as revenue climbed 14% to $10.2 billion, according to the company\u2019s earnings presentation. Payments volume also increased 8%. Profits rose despite a 35% jump in operating expenses, driven by a 26% rise in general and administrative costs and a 23% rise in professional fees, according to the presentation.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s emerging stablecoin solutions should accelerate its (commercial and money movement solutions) business,\u201d analysts at the financial firm William Blair told clients in a Wednesday note.

The company believes stablecoins are particularly well-suited for emerging market economies, where it has struggled to digitize payments effectively. This approach aims to accelerate the digitization of consumer, small business, and commercial payments in those regions. Visa is currently testing stablecoins in certain corridors to identify where they are most effective for faster and cheaper money movement.\n\n**Why it matters:** This strategy could significantly bolster Visa's cross-border and business-to-business payment plays, helping them make inroads in areas of low penetration like remittances.

        "summary_text": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday in a court filing that it will \u201csubstantially\u201d rework a U.S. open banking rule, prompting a federal judge to stay proceedings in a lawsuit that banking associations filed last year to block the measure.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent events in the marketplace, the Bureau has now decided to initiate a new rulemaking to reconsider the Rule with a view to substantially revising it and providing a robust justification,\u201d CFPB attorneys wrote in their motion to stay the case. The bureau faced a Tuesday deadline to reply to a filing from the Financial Technology Association, which has intervened to defend the 2024 rule.\n\nThe agency plans \u201can accelerated rulemaking process\u201d and said it would issue a rulemaking notice within three weeks to begin drafting a new rule. U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves of the Eastern District of Kentucky granted the stay request, telling litigants to update him every 45 days.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBefore Reeves\u2019 decision, the Financial Technology Association told the court that it did not oppose the bureau\u2019s request. By contrast, the bank plaintiffs opposed halting the litigation. In May, Reeves ruled that the FTA could intervene in the suit to defend its members\u2019 interests.\n\nThe FTA will \u201cparticipate in the rulemaking process in good faith in the hopes of achieving a solution that upholds consumers\u2019 fundamental right to their financial information,\u201d FTA CEO Penny Lee said in an emailed statement.\n\nFor fintechs, the fate of U.S. open banking gained new urgency over the past month as JPMorgan Chase informed several data aggregators of new fees for access to consumers\u2019 financial information.\n\nSuch fees, if widely adopted, could add hefty costs for fintechs seeking to handle transactions and lure customers away from banks. New fees could also hamper the growth of cryptocurrency enterprises and \u201crisks the future of fintech, digital assets, and America\u2019s financial innovation and global leadership,\u201d 10 associations wrote last week in a letter seeking President Donald Trump\u2019s help with the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad the CFPB recognized that financial institutions will take advantage of regulatory uncertainty and that consumers must retain the right to access and share access to their own financial data,\u201d Steve Boms, executive director of the Financial Data and Technology Association, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe American Fintech Council \u201cwill work with the CFPB to promote and support a regulatory framework that ensures consumers continue to benefit from products and services that serve their needs by making finance more accessible, transparent, and affordable,\u201d AFC CEO Phil Goldfeder said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, the Kentucky Bankers Association and Forcht Bank sued the CFPB last year to block the rule, arguing that the agency, under the Biden administration, had exceeded its authority, and challenged several aspects of the open banking rule, including its prohibition against assessing fees for data access. The CFPB later, under the Trump administration, adopted the plaintiffs\u2019 view, asking the court to set aside the rule, which it called \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bureau seeks to comprehensively reexamine this matter alongside stakeholders and the broader public to come up with a well-reasoned approach to these complex issues that aligns with the policy preferences of new leadership and addresses the defects in the initial Rule,\u201d the CFPB said in its motion.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the plaintiff banks filed their reply to the FTA\u2019s June 29 motion, reiterating their request for Reeves to set aside the rule.\n\nThe bureau had previously planned to draft a new rule to replace the current rule, a CFPB spokesperson said Tuesday via email, without elaborating. The spokesperson did not respond to questions about which areas of the open banking rule it aims to revise or the anticipated timeframe for that work.\n\nThe open banking rule stems from Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The banks contended in their filing Tuesday that the law requires sensitive financial data to be shared only with consumers, or their representative having \u201ca special, fiduciary-like relationship,\u201d not with third-party companies.\n\nThe CFPB adopted the rule in October. It is set to take effect for the largest banks in mid-2026, with compliance deadlines for other banks layered through 2030. Financial institutions with less than $850 million in assets are exempt from the rule.",

        "summary_text": "Bilt Technologies, which provides credit cards aimed at rent payments, will revamp its offering next year with its new issuing partner Cardless, pivoting away from its ties to Wells Fargo.\n\nBilt plans to have three cards with Cardless, starting in February, including two new cards with annual fees, as it expands from a single no-fee card, according to a press release earlier this month. The company has sought to build a business offering renters a way to earn loyalty points on their monthly rent payments to landlords.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies declined to discuss how the new cards\u2019 terms or rewards will differ from the Bilt Rewards card Wells Fargo has issued since 2022. The company has promised more details this fall.\n\nThe Wells Fargo card, tied to the Mastercard network, touts an ability to earn reward points on rental payments without a transaction fee. Bilt will move card holders from Wells to Cardless in February 2026, according to the July 10 release.\n\nApartment dwellers typically have not paid their monthly rents with credit or debit cards because of the interchange costs landlords would assume, or pass along to tenants, by accepting card payments. The interchange fee terms under the Bilt-Wells agreement meant the bank relied more on non-rent spending for interchange revenue.\n\nNew York-based Bilt and Wells Fargo found that some cardholders were using the card for their rent and for small charges, like a coffee, to meet a requirement of posting at least five transactions per payment period to earn rewards.\n\nWells Fargo lost as much as $10 million per month on its Bilt card because of such user behaviors, the Wall Street Journal reported in June 2024, citing people familiar with the matter. The bank had predicted that about 65% of spending on the Bilt card would be nonrent, but it turned out that only about 35% of card volumes were for charges not associated with rent, according to the Journal report.\n\nBecause of the financial losses, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo decided to quit its Bilt partnership three years before the 2029 end date, the Journal reported July 10, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment via email. A Bilt spokesperson said the company declined to comment beyond the July 10 press release that detailed the new cards with Cardless and its latest capital raise. San Francisco-based Cardless, a startup that issues cards for companies including Alibaba Group, Qatar Airways and Simon Property Group, also declined to comment.\n\nIn effect, Bilt\u2019s card offered point rewards coupled with a 30-day free loan, or float, on rent payments for people who did not carry a card balance, reducing income for Wells, said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a research publication on the card and payments industry.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not getting enough people who are revolvers to subsidize the portfolio of the people who are just transactors, you\u2019re in trouble, especially on a card that doesn\u2019t have the (annual) fee,\u201d Robertson said Wednesday in an interview, adding \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why (Wells Fargo) made the deal to begin with.\u201d\n\nBilt will need to \u201ctailor the card more to people who use it more broadly and revolve balances to address the revenue shortfall that Wells experienced,\u201d TD Cowen analyst Moshe Orenbuch wrote in a July 23 email.\n\n\u201cWe assume that the new manager of the program will design the products to attract consumers that would be more profitable,\u201d he said.\n\nBilt must become its customers\u2019 default card and earn top-of-wallet use status if the company and its partners want to generate a successful financial return, Robertson said.\n\nBilt, which is valued at $10.75 billion based on a $250 million capital raise this month, said in the July 10 press release that its revenue will top $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. The company says its payment platform includes 25% of U.S. apartment buildings and 40,000 merchants.\n\nBilt\u2019s \u201c2.0\u201d revamp with Cardless represents the company\u2019s foray into a fleet of three tiered card brands. A no-fee card will remain, joined by two cards with annual fees of $95 and $495, respectively. The company is also expanding from rental to mortgage payments, student housing and condominium HOA fees.\n\n\u201cYou have to make the rewards component so compelling that it justifies the $495,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cMaybe the answer to that as a card issuer is in co-partnerships, not cobranding. What kind of deals can you give the cardholder as an incentive for spending that also provide additional value? That might not simply be the bonus points, it might be discounts for you-name-it.\u201d\n\nThe Bilt-Cardless cards enter a landscape of consumer credit cards in which American Express, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase have all recently announced fee and benefit changes to their premium rewards cards.\n\n\u201cYou have Chase and AmEx \u2026 raising their annual fees, but also doubling down again in that very competitive world of trying to find out what\u2019s the most compelling value proposition to generate spending,\u201d Robertson said. One benefit Bilt might realize, he said, is that banks have raised premium card fees to near $800 annually, \u201cso $495 doesn\u2019t look so bad.\u201d\n\nBilt has 22 travel partners for points redemptions, including 17 airlines and five hotel chains. The points can also be redeemed for gift cards at retailers or to pay for Lyft rides.\n\nFormer American Express CEO Ken Chenault joined Bilt as board chairman in January 2024, when General Catalyst, the venture capital firm where he serves as chairman, helped to raise $200 million for Bilt. Roger Goodell, the National Football League commissioner, also joined Bilt\u2019s board last year.\n\nWells Fargo and Mastercard were among Bilt investors when the company announced a $60 million capital raise in September 2021, along with more than a dozen real estate companies.",

This move includes expanding from one no-fee card to three, with two new annual fee cards. Wells Fargo reportedly lost up to $10 million monthly on its Bilt card, leading the bank to quit the partnership three years early. Bilt will transfer existing cardholders from Wells Fargo to Cardless in February 2026.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters because Wells Fargo reportedly lost up to $10 million monthly on its Bilt card, primarily due to low non-rent spending and cardholders not revolving balances. This challenges the implied consensus that a no-fee rent payment card can be profitable for the issuer without substantial non-rent spending or revolving credit. The new strategy with Cardless, including annual fees, aims to attract more profitable consumers and address the revenue shortfall Wells Fargo experienced. Success for Bilt depends on becoming a default, top-of-wallet card for broader spending.\n\n**The big picture:** Bilt's core business aims to offer loyalty points for monthly rent payments, addressing a gap where card use for rent is typically avoided due to interchange fees. Wells Fargo's partnership faltered as non-rent spending on the Bilt card was significantly lower than predicted, leading to substantial losses. This new \"2.0\" revamp sees Bilt expanding its offering to three tiered cards with annual fees and broadening payment options to include mortgages, student housing, and HOA fees. The revamped cards enter a competitive market where other major card issuers are also adjusting their premium rewards card offerings.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Wells Fargo lost up to $10 million per month on its Bilt card.\n*   Wells Fargo predicted 65% non-rent spending, but only 35% of card volumes were non-rent.\n*   Bilt is valued at $10.75 billion after a $250 million capital raise this month.\n*   Bilt projects revenue to exceed $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026.\n*   New Bilt cards with Cardless will include annual fees of $95 and $495.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Bilt Technologies:** Revamping credit card offerings, shifting from Wells Fargo to Cardless for rent payments.\n*   **Wells Fargo:** Exiting its credit card partnership with Bilt due to reported monthly financial losses.\n*   **Cardless:** New issuing partner for Bilt's revamped credit card line, including new annual fee options.\n*   **David Robertson:** Nilson Report publisher, explained why Wells Fargo's Bilt card lost money.\n*   **Moshe Orenbuch:** TD Cowen analyst, anticipates new products will attract more profitable consumers.\n*   **Ken Chenault:** Former American Express CEO who joined Bilt as board chairman in January 2024.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Bilt has promised more details on the new cards\u2019 terms and rewards this fall.\n*   Bilt plans to launch its new cards with Cardless starting in February.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Bilt's new card strategy aims for profitability after Wells Fargo's costly partnership exit.",

In the first quarter, company revenue declined by 6.9% to $394 million compared to the year-ago quarter, where it made about $423 million, according to an earnings release.

During Q2, AUVs were at $2.1 million.\n\nWingstop already uses MyWingstop to build guest engagement.

It will leverage information from the chain\u2019s proprietary tech stack, MyWingstop, which already encompasses 60 million guest data points for personalized content. Management is confident this loyalty program, alongside the digital kitchen display platform, Wingstop Smart Kitchen, will help reach the $3 million average unit volume goal.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis initiative comes after Wingstop reported a rare 1.9% same-store sales decline in Q2, its first in three years, challenging a previous growth consensus. The loyalty program is positioned to drive traffic and bolster same-store sales, directly addressing this recent dip. Investing in technology, including this program, continues to be a key strategy that has previously paid off, with digital transactions already making up over 72% of systemwide sales. This suggests a strategic pivot to leverage a proven tech investment to reignite growth.\n\n**The big picture:**\nWingstop's investment in technology is a long-standing key strategy, having significantly boosted digital transactions to over 72% of systemwide sales. The company already uses its MyWingstop database, with 60 million guests, to build engagement, notably for the Crispy Chicken Tenders relaunch which reactivated lapsed users. This success informed the design of the new loyalty program. Other fast-casual chains, such as Portillo\u2019s and Chipotle, have also been updating or leveraging their rewards programs to build guest engagement, indicating a broader industry trend.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Q2 2025 Average Unit Volumes (AUVs): $2.1 million\n*   Wingstop's AUV goal: $3 million\n*   Digital transactions share of systemwide sales mix: over 72%\n*   MyWingstop database size: 60 million guests\n*   Q2 same-store sales decline: 1.9%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Michael Skipworth:** Wingstop CEO, announced the Q4 loyalty program pilot and detailed its purpose.\n*   **Alex Kaleida:** Wingstop CFO and Senior Vice President, stated the Crispy Chicken Tenders relaunch informed loyalty program design.\n*   **Peter Saleh:** BTIG analyst, suggested loyalty could boost sales for lesser-known products or slower dayparts.\n*   **Wingstop:** Fast casual chain planning to pilot a new loyalty program to drive engagement and sales.\n*   **Portillo\u2019s:** Fast casual chain that launched an app-less reward program earlier this year.\n*   **Chipotle:** Fast casual chain that amplified its rewards program with a \"Summer of Extras\" campaign.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Pilot of the loyalty program during the fourth quarter.\n*   Systemwide launch of the loyalty program expected in 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWingstop bets on loyalty tech to reverse sales dip and boost growth.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nStarbucks is maintaining its emphasis on customer experience, with an eye toward operations, as it pursues a turnaround.\n\nThe Back to Starbucks plan, which was introduced in September 2024 and grounded in customer and associate feedback, remains the right strategy for the job, according to CEO Brian Niccol. In-store customer experience plays a key role in the turnaround effort.\n\n\u201cWe are building a better Starbucks, where everyone can experience the best of Starbucks, one that is stronger, more resilient and consistently growing, a Starbucks that is once again the gold standard in customer service, partner experience, the coffeehouse experience and financial performance,\u201d Niccol said on a fiscal Q3 2025 earnings call Tuesday.\n\nStarbucks still has work to do. Global comparable store sales fell 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2025, according to a company earnings report. Total net revenue rose 4% year over year to $9.5 billion.\n\nExecutives say that the company is on the right track, and that efforts like the Green Apron Service model are setting the stage for improvements to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fixing the operational foundations of the business and building a platform for innovation in 2026,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cSome of the changes are already visible while others will be seen in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nExecutives shared Starbucks\u2019 CX wins and fresh initiatives on the company\u2019s third quarter 2025 earnings call. Here are four major takeaways:\n\n1. Experience investments are showing promise\n\nWhile Starbucks\u2019 comparable sales are still trending downward, customer perceptions of the experience are on the upswing, according to Niccol.\n\nCustomers are taking notice of improvements to speed, hospitality and accuracy at Starbucks locations, according to Niccol. Customer connection scores are up and customer complaints are down quarter over quarter and year over year, while the brand\u2019s value perceptions are at near two-year highs.\n\nThe company is seeing gains among Gen Z and millennial customers, who make up over half of Starbucks\u2019 base, according to Niccol. Transaction growth from non-Starbucks Rewards members also rose year over year.\n\nStarbucks is adopting a growth scorecard to help the company keep track of the metrics that will drive its future financial performance.\n\n\u201cIt's about the customer,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cIt's about our being staffed correctly. It's about ensuring that we obviously get the right speed requirements hit. And so when we do those things, we see the outcomes that we want, which is transaction growth which then ultimately, I think, is a key indicator of health in the business.\u201d\n\n2. Four-minute handoffs remain a priority\n\nOne of the biggest challenges at Starbucks in recent years has been wait times, driven by the popularity of mobile ordering \u2014 which was slowing down in-person and drive-thru customers.\n\nNiccol made getting mobile orders under control a top priority and set the goal of fulfilling in-person orders within four minutes and mobile orders in no more than 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nEfforts like better order sequencing have helped speed up drink making, and average peak drive-thru times are at three minutes and 20 seconds at the 7,600 locations with drive-thrus, according to Niccol.\n\nStarbucks will maintain its commitment to four-minute handoffs as it rolls out new processes, according to Niccol. \u201cOne of the principles for our innovation is it cannot negatively impact our ability to deliver on cafe orders in less than four minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is using Green Apron Service to prepare it to implement innovations without slowing down the customer experience, according to Niccol. The model is expected to help Starbucks make further changes while minimizing the impact on baristas.\n\n3. CX benefits have a ramp up time\n\nGreen Apron Service, slated to start expanding across company-operated U.S. locations in August, is being rolled out ahead of schedule, according to Niccol.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal is to have the model in place ahead of pumpkin spice season, according to Niccol. While cafes with Green Apron Service saw improvements to metrics including sales and customer service times, they didn\u2019t manifest immediately.\n\nGreen Apron Service includes adding more employee hours, and it \u201ctakes a little bit of time for us to get into a rhythm with the new labor that we have on the team,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cAnd that also takes a little bit of time for our customers to recognize that they're getting a different kind of service experience.\u201d\n\nHowever, once established, locations using Green Apron Service show good results, according to Niccol. He noted that customers appreciate the better experience, and he expects the positive trends to continue improving.\n\nMany customers come into Starbucks for pumpkin spice season, \"and now they're going to experience Green Apron Service,\" Niccol said. \"And I just think that's a winning proposition for us that sets the table for what's to come in 2026.\u201d\n\n4. Loyalty is still growing\n\nStarbucks Rewards has nearly 34 million 90-day active members, and Starbucks plans to continue evolving the loyalty program to keep them coming back.\n\nPlans include a new Starbucks app, enhancements to mobile order and new pay options \u201cthat will further improve our ability to deliver a great customer experience at pickup,\u201d Niccol said. The company plans to address customer feedback with its updates.\n\nOne of Starbucks\u2019 goals is to continue growing non-discounted transactions with loyalty members, according to Niccol. That number is on the rise quarter over quarter, but Niccol sees more work to do, noting that the rewards program has put too much emphasis on discounts.\n\n\u201cAnd the feedback we've gotten from customers that are part of it is, if I'm a really big loyal customer, I think there should be more recognition of that,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cAnd if I'm a less frequent customer, we should then set up the program so that it fits for them.\u201d\n\nStarbucks plans to tailor the program to be more about recognizing loyalty and engagement, according to Niccol. The company expects to reveal more information in February 2026.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWingstop has installed the Wingstop Smart Kitchen, a new kitchen operating system, in 1,000 restaurants, with full deployment across its U.S. system expected by the end of the year, CEO Micheal Skipworth said Wednesday on the chain\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call.\n\nRestaurants with the Wingstop Smart Kitchen have seen a 40% reduction in ticket times within four weeks of implementation. \u201cMarkets with the Wingstop Smart Kitchen are delivering faster speed, a more consistent guest experience and sales outperformance, and all of this without additional advertising to the guests,\u201d Skipworth said.\n\nThese kitchen changes will likely help bolster comparable sales, which fell 1.9% in Q2 2025, the first decline reported by the fast casual chain since Q2 2022. Skipworth said that the comps were up against strong sales growth of 28.4% in the year-ago quarter and 16.8% in Q2 2023.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nRestaurants with Smart Kitchens, including the initial 160 stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth test market, reported \u201cmeaningfully higher same-store sales growth relative to control restaurants,\u201d Skipworth said.\n\nThe new KDS includes four touch-screen monitors and uses predictive order management, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a June 30 report detailing a restaurant tour. The system offers greater operational precision. For example, the KDS displays how many ounces of fries need to be cooked, an improvement on employees guessing portions, Saleh said. The system uses a restaurant\u2019s existing servers and tech stack, and can be installed overnight and enabled the next day.\n\nTicket times in modernized kitchens are down to about 10 minutes, compared to 18 to 22 minutes \u201con our best days,\u201d Skipworth said, adding that it takes restaurants about four weeks to acclimate to the new system and hit these ticket times. These restaurants also have seen an eight-point increase in guest satisfaction scores compared to restaurants without a Smart Kitchen, he added.\n\nWingstop Smart Kitchen is also decreasing delivery times, which sometimes exceeded 40 minutes and frustrated customers, Skipworth said. Delivery times are now under 30 minutes for third-party delivery.\n\n\u201cWe believe the faster service times will be a key component to bridge the gap from 30% to 50% delivery mix, as customers on delivery apps can sort by criteria like fastest near them and delivery within 30 minutes, so Wingstop can now be in those consideration sets,\u201d Saleh said.\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, year-over-year sales growth is already outpacing U.S. delivery sales by mid-single digits.\n\n\u201cThe results we are seeing from the Wingstop Smart Kitchen are exactly what we had anticipated and are validating the opportunities we have within our strategies supporting our long term target of scaling AUVs to $3 million,\u201d Skipworth said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWayback Burgers\u2019 franchisor wants to redefine what it means to be a multi-brand franchisee. On Thursday, it unveiled Hubspoke Brands, a franchising platform that supports multi-brand ownership within the fast casual segment. Jake\u2019s Franchising, the franchisor of Wayback Burgers, also rebranded as Wayback Franchising, the company said in an emailed press release.\n\nHubspoke Brands currently offers six concepts, including Molte Pizze, giving franchisees the opportunity to expand into different brands without changing franchisors.\n\n\u201cIt makes it easier from an operational perspective. [For some multi-brand franchisees], the back offices are different at all the brands, the requirements are different, and we can bring it all under one [company] and make it more efficient for them,\u201d John Eucalitto, Wayback Franchising CEO, said.\n\nWayback Franchising opened the first Hubspoke Kitchen over a year ago, a company-owned unit that houses six brands and prepares meals in an off-premise-focused space in Connecticut. The next version of Hubspoke Kitchen will contain indoor seating, going along with the trend of customers returning to dine-in.\n\nMore On Hubspoke Brands Molte Pizze: The concept offers crispy tavern-style, foldable New York and cheesy, caramelized Detroit pizzas. Pane & Mozz: The brand offers focaccia sandwiches with meats, cheeses and toppings as well as hot sides like tots and fries, salads and wings. Taculto: A taco, burrito and bowl concept. Citta Pasta: The brand offers scratch-made pasta dishes, salads, wings and Italian-style side dishes. Uncle Willie\u2019s Smokehouse: The barbecue concept offers slow-smoked meats and Southern sides like mac and cheese, baked beans, and corn bread with honey butter.\n\nRenaming the franchisor and expanding its brands was years in the making, Eucalitto said, adding that planning began in 2018, but the COVID-19 pandemic put this work on hold.\n\nThe new platform and the sister brands don\u2019t mean Wayback Burgers is slowing down its current growth rate. Wayback Burgers, which has about 180 units, has roughly 15 stores currently under construction. It expects 10 to 25 units to open in 2025, which could push its unit count to 200 by year's end.\n\nWith Wayback Burgers growing post-pandemic, Eucalitto and his team decided to pull the trigger on the new brand platform. Franchisees have been growing in the last five years, but through M&A, private equity or other means, but Eucalitto said he wants to offer another way for growth.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t aspire to do that. We aspire to continue to grow and help our staff and our franchisees grow, but see how we can do it better,\u201d Eucalitto said.\n\nA Detroit-style pizza from Molte Pizze Permission granted by Wayback Franchising\n\nGrowing Hubspoke Brands\n\nThe Hubspoke Kitchen concept, which is also under the Hubspoke Brands platform, is designed for experienced operators rather than first-time franchisees, Eucalitto said. The company\u2019s variety of brands can benefit multi-branded operators who may have sold out a concept in particular territory and are looking to other concepts for growth. It can potentially open up new real estate options too, especially in shopping centers, where there may be competing brands. Hubspoke\u2019s roster of brands means operators can shift to a different brand that won\u2019t face intense sales competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d pivot to something else to better compete if we needed to, because that\u2019s how Hubspoke is supposed to be,\u201d Eucalitto said, adding that he expects Hubspoke to expand from six brands to 10 to 12.\n\nHubspoke expects its multi-brand units to show strong volume and controllable food and labor costs. At the Hubspoke Kitchen in Wallingford, Connecticut, each brand has its own station to test its performance with just two or three employees. Wayback Franchising is testing the brands outside the Hubspoke model to measure performance.\n\nSo far, the company feels like its Molte Pizza and Pane & Mozz brands are ready to standalone after being proven within Hubspoke Kitchen.\n\nThe company is already building out three co-branded concepts, one of which, a Molte Pizza and a Wayback Burgers in New Jersey, is opening next week. It has more co-branded locations forthcoming in Bridgeport and Orange, Connecticut, both of which are owned by a multi-unit, multi-brand franchisee, Eucalitto said. A standalone Pane and Mozz will also open near the existing Hubspoke Kitchen in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Hubspoke Kitchen model as a market/restaurant/multi-branded or multi-menu mix concept will last \u2026 We have to focus on making every individual brand and the product and the systems as best as we possibly can, so that they can stand on their own,\u201d Eucalitto.\n\nHubspoke Kitchens can also be used to test new menu items. For example, the company came up with an ice cream parfait for Wayback within a Hubspoke Kitchen as a way to save leftover cookies that would otherwise go to waste. This is the top selling item in the Hubspoke Kitchen, he said, adding that the parfaits will be rolled out to Wayback Burgers in September or October.\n\nA double bacon cheeseburger from Wayback Burgers Permission granted by Wayback Franchising\n\nWayback Burgers remains key brand\n\nWayback has been focusing on improving back office operations and getting systems in place to support franchisees, like up-to-date data and reporting, Eucalitto said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot lose sight of Wayback [Burgers]. That is the most important brand for us,\u201d Eucalitto said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t exist, we wouldn\u2019t be here. We have to continue with it. We know we can do much better with it.\u201d\n\nWayback realigned and expanded its corporate team this past year to ensure that leaders were in the right place doing what they do best, Eucalitto said.\n\nFrom a technology perspective, the company improved how it communicates key metrics and sales data to operators. Franchisees typically see daily sales reports from their own point-of-sales systems as well as from corporate, which sends daily journals and recommendations on different sales drivers. This has helped cut down the time needed to reconcile POS data from nearly an hour to five minutes.\n\nThe company, which has done very little advertising since the COVID-19 pandemic started, also said it would collect 2% local marketing fee and spend it with franchisees, which it hasn\u2019t done before: Wayback previously left marketing to franchisees. Regions will now pool their resources for marketing in addition to national marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cWe're very conservative, we're very slow and methodical, but we do everything we possibly can to help because we only have that one customer,\u201d Eucalitto said. \u201cAnd that's the franchisees.\u201d",

        "summary": "Here is the summary of the provided article:\n\n**Headline:** Wayback Burgers' Franchisor Unveils Hubspoke, Expanding Multi-Brand Fast Casual Platform\n\n**Key details:**\nWayback Burgers\u2019 franchisor, Jake's Franchising, has rebranded as Wayback Franchising and unveiled Hubspoke Brands. This new platform supports multi-brand ownership within the fast-casual segment, currently offering six concepts like Molte Pizze and Pane & Mozz. The goal is to make multi-brand operations more efficient by unifying back office systems for franchisees. Wayback Franchising also operates a company-owned Hubspoke Kitchen in Connecticut, testing brands in an off-premise-focused space.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis initiative provides franchisees with a new growth avenue, distinct from M&A or private equity, by allowing expansion into different brands without changing franchisors. Streamlining operations for multi-brand owners could enhance profitability and efficiency. The platform potentially opens up new real estate options and allows operators to shift brands to better compete in specific territories. This strategy challenges the traditional single-brand franchising model by offering a more integrated and diversified approach for growth.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe development of Hubspoke Brands was years in the making, with planning starting in 2018 but paused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Wayback Burgers continues its growth, expecting up to 200 units by year-end 2025. The franchisor emphasizes its conservative, methodical approach, aiming to help franchisees grow while keeping Wayback Burgers as its \"most important brand.\" The company has also improved internal operations, including technology for franchisee communication and sales data reporting.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **6:** Concepts currently offered under Hubspoke Brands.\n*   **180:** Approximate number of Wayback Burgers units.\n*   **15:** Wayback Burgers stores currently under construction.\n*   **10 to 25:** Expected Wayback Burgers units to open in 2025.\n*   **200:** Potential Wayback Burgers unit count by year's end 2025.\n*   **2%:** Local marketing fee Wayback will now collect and spend with franchisees.\n*   **5 minutes:** Reduced time for POS data reconciliation for franchisees (from nearly an hour).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Wayback Burgers:** The core burger concept, identified as the franchisor's \"most important brand.\"\n*   **Jake\u2019s Franchising:** The former name of Wayback Burgers' franchisor, now rebranded as Wayback Franchising.\n*   **Wayback Franchising:** The rebranded franchisor of Wayback Burgers, which launched the new Hubspoke Brands.\n*   **Hubspoke Brands:** A new franchising platform designed to support multi-brand ownership in fast-casual.\n*   **Molte Pizze:** A fast-casual pizza concept, one of six offered under the new Hubspoke Brands platform.\n*   **Pane & Mozz:** A focaccia sandwich concept, also offered as part of the new Hubspoke Brands platform.\n*   **Taculto:** A taco, burrito, and bowl concept available within the Hubspoke Brands platform.\n*   **Citta Pasta:** A scratch-made pasta concept, one of the new brands under Hubspoke Brands.\n*   **Uncle Willie\u2019s Smokehouse:** A barbecue concept featuring slow-smoked meats under Hubspoke Brands.\n*   **John Eucalitto:** CEO of Wayback Franchising, who provided insights on the new platform and strategy.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A co-branded Molte Pizza and Wayback Burgers location is opening next week in New Jersey.\n*   Ice cream parfaits, tested in Hubspoke Kitchens, will roll out to Wayback Burgers in September or October.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nWayback diversifies its franchise growth by consolidating multi-brand operations.",

For example, Niccol said the chain will introduce a protein Cold Foam customization.\n\nStarting next year, the chain will launch a new baked goods case, a new variety of dark roast coffee and other menu changes, with a particular focus on experiential drinks and afternoon snacks, Niccol said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSome of Starbucks\u2019 food innovations could come from tests in other markets. Canada has been a strong food market for the chain in recent months, selling pancakes and waffles and will begin to serve bagel bites soon, Niccol said. Food innovation is helping to drive same-store sales growth.\n\n\u201cThere is [an] opportunity for us to figure out what they\u2019re doing up in Canada from a food standpoint to figure out what makes sense for us to bring not only to the U.S. but around the world,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nFrom a drinks standpoint, Starbucks will test alternatives, such as coconut water-based tea and coffee drinks in select markets, Niccol said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lean into customer needs with upcoming tests of gluten-free and high-protein options to create food that\u2019s as artisanal as our beverages,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nThe combined focus on ingredients, like coconut water and added protein, place Starbucks\u2019 new strategy squarely within the major menu trends in restaurants. Premium coffee concepts that focus on on-premise experiences are doing well, while consumers are looking for healthy-seeming inclusions, like protein and fruit, in new drinks.\n\nSimultaneously, the growth of caffeinated beverages other than coffee is creating new daypart opportunities. With QSR chains like McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands focusing on new drinks development, Starbucks may be looking to preserve its position as a go-to beverage chain from new entrants seeking to capitalize on shifting consumer sentiment.\n\nStarbucks is standardizing its menu test process by rolling out new items in five stores, a shift the chain calls the Starting 5.\n\nNiccol said the aim of the Starting 5 is to ensure \u201cinnovation is being co-built with our baristas in our stores, versus we build it in the support center, we throw it over the wall, and we hope that our baristas can figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe coffee giant will do its menu development in conjunction with its field teams and baristas from now on in an effort to prevent new drinks and additions \u2014 like the protein Cold Foam \u2014 from adding unnecessary operational complexity.\n\nThat Cold Foam will come with 15 grams of protein per serving in Q4. Sales of the original Cold Foam modifiers rose 23% year over year.\n\nNiccol said that during the protein Cold Foam development process, Starbucks \u201ctapped into our baristas to help us fine-tune the program so that it\u2019s executed in a way that can be a great drink every time on the speed requirements that our customers expect.\u201d\n\nThe menu additions follow a campaign of simplification earlier this year that, when it was announced, was forecast to trim about 30% of the chain\u2019s menu. Niccol said that simplification was necessary to reduce the labor demands of the menu and free up space for new menu items.",

That\u2019s according to a GlobalData analysis, which sees Adidas as one of the biggest winners in the global apparel market in 2025.\n\nLast year, Nike held 2.9% of the global apparel market, 1.1 percentage points higher than Adidas. In 2025, that\u2019s expected to decline by 0.3 percentage points, at the same time that Adidas\u2019 share grows by 0.1 percentage point.\n\nOther share gainers in apparel this year will be Shein, Uniqlo, Skechers and New Balance, according to GlobalData\u2019s forecast. Puma, which just reported a Q2 sales decline and slashed its full-year forecast due to tariffs and soft sales trends, is expected to lose share, alongside H&M and Louis Vuitton.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe upheaval caused by the Trump administration\u2019s ever-changing tariff policies is impacting all retailers in one way or another, though apparel is one of the hardest-hit sectors. Within that segment, retailers are raising prices and shifting production to cut down on costs, all while navigating a wary consumer.\n\n\u201cBrands that can quickly react to trends and offer good value for money will have the opportunity to gain share, whereas those that are unable to compete on price or style are forecast to lose out,\u201d Tom Ljubojevic, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement.\n\nStyle is one of the reasons Adidas is forecast to win, with GlobalData citing the success of its Originals line and performance footwear in the current environment. Adidas just this week reported sales growth of 2% in Q2 and said it expects style preferences to continue to work in its favor. Nike, on the other hand, is struggling under the weight of lackluster innovation and the need to cut down on core franchises.\n\n\u201cElsewhere within sportswear, New Balance and Skechers are also expected to gain share, bolstered by their versatility, alongside their high-profile athlete and brand partnerships,\u201d Ljubojevic said.\n\nSkechers has been on a tear recently, expanding into categories including soccer cleats and basketball shoes, alongside a robust brand ambassador strategy. Among others, Skechers has signed Harry Kane, Julius Randle, Terance Mann, OG Anunoby, Bernhard Langer and Kiki Iriafen. The retailer also recently signed a deal to sell itself to 3G Capital for $9.4 billion.\n\nAlthough Shein will gain share again this year, that growth is slowing now \u201cdue to its established presence,\u201d GlobalData said. Low prices and quick action on trends are helping the brand outshine others in apparel, though, including H&M and Zara.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAdditions to fast-food menus rarely get six months to build buzz, but that was not the case with the return of Snack Wraps to McDonald\u2019s. The chain\u2019s U.S. president Joe Erlinger confirmed the return of the cult favorite item, which was removed from most U.S. locations in 2016, in December 2024, kicking off months of hype from fans and the brand.\n\nBut McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t alone. In an attempt to hijack the conversation and beat the Golden Arches to the punch, Popeyes on June 2 announced the addition of Chicken Wraps to its menu, offering \u201ca whole lot of flavor without breaking the bank.\u201d\n\nSince then, the marketing \u2014 and competitive sparring \u2014 has continued, with Taco Bell getting into the chicken wrap game and KFC, Wingstop and even White Castle doubling down on marketing around chicken. These efforts demonstrate how QSRs continue to market the protein, years after the so-called chicken sandwich wars reinvigorated the category.\n\n\"Our foot traffic data indicates that while value is important, innovation is equally relevant to QSR consumers when making purchase decision,\u201d said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, in emailed comments. \u201cOver the past few years, chicken has been a major source of innovation across the QSR category, from new chicken strip offerings to, more recently, various snack wrap options.\u201d\n\nLovin\u2019 nostalgia\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s, the power of innovation is in the data. On the day of Snack Wrap\u2019s return (July 10), visits to the chain were up 15%, compared to the year-to-date average, with visits on July 11 increasing 22.3% compared to the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe Snack Wrap\u2019s successful comeback is the latest example of a revived product finding success, reinforcing the power of nostalgia in today\u2019s QSR limited-time offers,\u201d Hottovy told Marketing Dive\u2019s sister publication Restaurant Dive.\n\nTo market the return of the Snack Wrap, McDonald\u2019s leaned into that nostalgia, as it has with everything from a sales-lifting celebration of Grimace\u2019s birthday to Happy Meals, McNugget Buddies and collector cups. The brand launched a throwback web portal to hype the return, extending the campaign with a TV spot, social posts, out-of-home ads and a Snapchat activation.\n\nBut the chain is also using the return of the Snack Wrap to take its marketing forward. The chain recently appointed Translation as its new agency of record for the African American consumer market. To reach that market, the agency created an \u201cUnc\u201d character, played by Hassan Johnson (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), who features in ads that co-sign the Snack Wrap for a generation of consumers who weren\u2019t around during the product\u2019s heyday.\n\nTranslation has worked with McDonald\u2019s before, on the creation of the iconic \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d jingle and a \u201cThink with Your Mouth\u201d Big Mac campaign. Moving forward, the brand and agency hope to deliver more insight-led, culturally informed campaigns, per a statement.\n\nChicken wars continue\n\nIn its efforts to needle McDonald\u2019s, Popeyes looked to instigate a full-blown \u201cwrap battle\u201d with what it billed as the first-ever artificial intelligence-generated diss track music video. The chain partnered with creator PJ Accetturo for a video that featured \u2014 among other things \u2014 a Popeyes party, a knight in shining armor and a depressed, fast-food-slinging clown.\n\n\u201cMore than just a brand video, this marks a shift in how fast food connects with fans: not through polished ads, but through collaborative creativity,\u201d a brand spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPopeyes was not alone in getting into the so-called wrap wars. Taco Bell built on its launch of a crispy chicken nuggets product with crispy chicken burritos and tacos \u2014 the latter resembling a snack wrap, by any other name. The products are part of a full, permanent crispy-chicken platform that will roll out by 2026.\n\n\u201cCrispy chicken is having a moment, but our fans made it a movement,\u201d said Taco Bell CMO Taylor Montgomery, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not like every other chicken spot out there, we\u2019re doing crispy chicken the only way we know how: full of flavor and unmistakably Taco Bell.\u201d\n\nTo connect with fans around culture, Taco Bell took to Cameo to cast a wide net of brand ambassadors, from actress Kate Flannery (\u201cThe Office\u201d), rapper-actor GaTa and celebrity chef Christian Petroni for the new crispy chicken products. The chain also began running an ad wherein a consumer ponders the unlikely pairing of a \u201cCrispy Chicken From a Taco Place.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more unlikely than crispy chicken from a taco place is crispy chicken from the world\u2019s first fast-food hamburger chain. Yet White Castle on June 30 launched a Crispy Chicken Slider alongside branded merch and a $5 combo only available to rewards members. Loyalty plays have increased as restaurant chains look to entice cash-strapped consumers during an uncertain economic period.\n\nChicken chain bona fides\n\nWhile many in the QSR space are focused on snack wraps, other chicken-focused chains are ramping up marketing, as well. KFC this month looked to enter its \u201ccomeback era\u201d with a multipart campaign that features both a spot co-starring celebrity chef and actor Matty Matheson and a push to make founder-mascot Colonel Sanders more serious. The campaign, \u201cThe Colonel Lived So We Could Chicken,\u201d looks to right the ship after a period of U.S. sales declines amid increased competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of the latest fried chicken rankings and I\u2019m fired up to launch a bold Kentucky Fried Comeback and remind America exactly who we are,\u201d said Catherine Tan-Gillespie, president of KFC U.S., in a statement. \u201cIf people can give their ex a million second chances, I hope our fans can give us one.\u201d\n\nAmong KFC\u2019s major competitors is Wingstop, which saw 41% growth in consumer spend in 2024 \u2014 the largest gain among the top 50 restaurant chains \u2014 according to Circana data. The chain has been an active marketer as of late, teaming with WNBA star Paige Bueckers for a celebrity meal reminiscent of those offered by McDonald\u2019s Famous Orders platform. Wingstop also looked to make their dominance in chicken official, filing an application to register the \u201cNational Chicken Tender Day\u201d trademark.\n\n\u201cSome say that chicken fingers, strips and tenders are the same, but Wingstop isn't buying it,\u201d said Mark Christenson, Wingstop's chief revenue officer, in a press release. \u201cBy filing a trademark application to register 'National Chicken Tender Day,' Wingstop is giving the finger to fingers and staking our claim on our distinctive crispy tenders that fans crave.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** McDonald's Snack Wrap comeback sparks renewed fast-food chicken battles.\n\n**Key details:**\nMcDonald's Snack Wraps returned on July 10, confirmed by U.S. president Joe Erlinger, after being removed in 2016. This sparked a \"wrap battle\" with Popeyes, which launched its own chicken wraps on June 2 to preempt McDonald's. Other QSRs like Taco Bell, KFC, Wingstop, and White Castle have also intensified their chicken marketing and new product launches. McDonald's saw significant foot traffic increases of 15% and 22.3% on July 10 and 11, respectively, after the Snack Wrap's return. Popeyes used an AI-generated diss track, while Taco Bell is rolling out a permanent crispy-chicken platform.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis resurgence in chicken-focused marketing highlights that while value remains crucial for QSR consumers, innovation is equally relevant for purchase decisions. The success of revived products, like McDonald's Snack Wrap, reinforces the power of nostalgia in driving traffic and sales. This challenges a potential consensus view that QSRs primarily compete solely on price or entirely new concepts, demonstrating that reintroducing popular items and specific protein innovation can be highly effective.\n\n**The big picture:**\nSnack Wraps, a \"cult favorite,\" were removed from most McDonald's U.S. locations in 2016. The fast-food industry has seen a resurgence in chicken offerings years after the initial \"chicken sandwich wars\" reignited the category. Companies are now focusing on chicken innovation, ranging from new strip offerings to various snack wrap options, to capture consumer interest and drive sales.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Snack Wraps removed from McDonald's U.S. locations in 2016.\n*   McDonald's visits increased 15% on July 10 vs. year-to-date average.\n*   McDonald's visits increased 22.3% on July 11 vs. year-to-date average.\n*   Popeyes announced Chicken Wraps on June 2.\n*   Wingstop experienced 41% growth in consumer spend in 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **McDonald\u2019s:** Confirmed Snack Wrap return, saw increased visits, launched nostalgia marketing.\n*   **Joe Erlinger:** McDonald\u2019s U.S. president, confirmed the return of the Snack Wrap.\n*   **Popeyes:** Launched Chicken Wraps to preempt McDonald's, used AI diss track marketing.\n*   **Taco Bell:** Entered chicken wrap game, building permanent crispy-chicken platform by 2026.\n*   **KFC:** Launched \"comeback era\" campaign to address U.S. sales declines.\n*   **Wingstop:** Saw significant consumer spend growth, applied to trademark \"National Chicken Tender Day.\"\n*   **White Castle:** Launched a Crispy Chicken Slider and a $5 combo for rewards members.\n*   **R.J. Hottovy:** Head of analytical research at Placer.ai, commented on innovation and nostalgia.\n*   **Translation:** McDonald's new agency for African American market, created \"Unc\" character for ads.\n*   **Hassan Johnson:** Actor from \"The Wire,\" plays \"Unc\" character in McDonald's Snack Wrap ads.\n*   **PJ Accetturo:** Creator Popeyes partnered with for an AI-generated diss track music video.\n*   **Taylor Montgomery:** Taco Bell CMO, stated crispy chicken is a \"movement\" for their fans.\n*   **Kate Flannery:** Actress from \"The Office,\" cast by Taco Bell as a brand ambassador.\n*   **GaTa:** Rapper-actor cast by Taco Bell as a brand ambassador for new chicken products.\n*   **Christian Petroni:** Celebrity chef cast by Taco Bell as a brand ambassador for new chicken products.\n*   **Matty Matheson:** Celebrity chef and actor, co-starring in KFC's new multi-part comeback campaign.\n*   **Catherine Tan-Gillespie:** President of KFC U.S., commented on KFC's \"Kentucky Fried Comeback\" strategy.\n*   **Mark Christenson:** Wingstop's chief revenue officer, commented on their distinctive crispy tenders.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nFast-food chicken wars intensify, driven by innovation and nostalgic favorites.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nYum Brands knows, years ahead of time, which flavors it will pursue for beverage innovation. This strategic foresight is made possible by two factors, said Yum Brands Chief Marketing Officer Ken Muench.\n\nFirst, Muench said, fast food is near the end of the cultural adoption cycle for most flavor trends \u2014 brands have to appeal to a wide range of consumers, and they\u2019re constantly chasing flavors that are well known but still on the upswing. In other words, these chains seek the most advanced, yet acceptable ideas, Muench said. Second is a 35-person unit within Yum, called Collider Labs, that monitors consumer trends across major markets in real time.\n\n\u201cOur entire job is to look at where culture is going, look at where consumers are headed and then inform the brands. And we do that years ahead of time,\u201d Muench said. \u201cIt's probably the largest beverage database in the world.\u201d\n\nThat database has allowed Yum to understand the shifting landscape of consumer preference, identify where trends are coming from, and intervene in menu strategies to position restaurants to take advantage of these trends.\n\nThe QSR beverage opportunity is growing\n\nOne trend of particular importance to Yum is the expansion of the kind of drinks consumers are willing to buy from QSRs, Muench said. Collider identified how consumer acceptance of beverage types was changing, and communicated that to Yum\u2019s constituent brands.\n\nFor KFC, that meant looking into lemonades, refreshers, milkshakes and iced coffee as development opportunities, said Val Kubizniak, KFC\u2019s chief marketing officer. The pace of beverage development is attractive and advantageous to brands, she said. Kubizniak said that the nature of beverage development offers advantages for brands.\n\n\u201cDeveloping products like new burgers or new tenders takes time,\u201d Kubizniak said. \u201cBut beverages can be quite a fast space to play in once you're working with the right suppliers.\u201d\n\nMuench said QSR coffee drinks are on the cusp of that \u201cmost advanced, yet accepted status,\u201d because consumers have begun to favor cold, convenience and visual appearance over hot and on-premise coffee experiences in the last decade and a half.\n\nSuch structural trends have resulted in drinks like Taco Bell\u2019s Churros Chillers and Coffee Chillers. Muench said the company is looking at a variety of wider coffee options.\n\n\u201cWhether it's cold coffee, cold brew, varieties of coffee with bubbles in it, with inclusions in it, with a cream top, a foam top, all that sort of stuff, is a super interesting area that was never open to QSRs before,\u201d Muench said.\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s refreshers, called refrescas, are a prime example of the expanding QSR beverage opportunities. Courtesy of Taco Bell\n\nCold coffee and blended coffee beverages don\u2019t require the same degree of equipment as hot espresso drinks, which are still a no-go for Taco Bell and KFC consumers, Muench said.\n\n\u201cThere's some things that intuitively don't work. Hot coffee and Mexican food doesn't work for Americans yet,\u201d Muench said. \u201cHot coffee and fried chicken, at least in Western countries, [is] also a weird thing.\u201d\n\nOther beverages like iced teas, lemonades and various refreshers present clearer, easier opportunities for Yum Brands to adopt. And Yum\u2019s standard for acceptability is quite high.\n\n\u201cQSRs in the U.S. reach 95% of consumers,\u201d Muench said. \u201cIf it's just applicable to 10% it's not interesting. If it's just applicable to 30% to 40%, it's not really interesting. If it's applicable to 50%, now you're starting to get to a place where, okay, maybe this is something we should then expand.\u201d\n\nHow do preference changes become new drinks?\n\nBeverage trends often start in higher end, experiential restaurant concepts or in markets outside the U.S., Muench said.\n\n\u201cBasically, if it's catching on in South Korea, it's going to catch on anywhere in the world. That's the shorthand,\u201d Muench said. The political economy of South Korea, which has limited socio-economic mobility, encourages younger consumers to compete to be trendy, according to Muench.\n\nYum collects drink ideas from particularly innovative regions. Then Collider works with the brands to host innovation sessions, which can result in up to 150 ideas.\n\nThe next step is less intuitive: Yum uses prediction markets to assess a narrow range of drink options. These sorts of markets use betting data to assess the likelihood of given outcomes. The most famous such market is PredictIt, which allows individuals to events like the 2025 New York Mayoral race.\n\nYum asks consumers to bet on which drinks, out of a slate of 10, are likely to be the most successful, Muench said. The theory behind this strategy is that a large group of people \u2014 Yum asks upwards of 500 consumers in each country it assesses \u2014 are good at predicting what in aggregate might be popular, rather than what they, individually, might enjoy drinking.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in college, you know before your roommate knows that he's going to break up with his girlfriend,\u201d Muench said. \u201cWe are much better predictors of other people\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\nYum asks consumers to predict a variety of outcomes, both long-term popularity and short-term buzz, which helps offset conservative estimates. Buzzy items with a lower predicted popularity can make good candidates for limited trials, Muench said. Short-form video social media platforms shortened the time it takes a drink to go from a fringe option to something a broad swath of consumers clamor for. Successful drinks ideas in prediction markets then go through Yum\u2019s flavor testing and design process to refine and finalize ingredients.\n\nA view of a KFC restaurant on July 10, 2024 in Vallejo, California. Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\n\nA Case Study: KFC\n\nGiven Yum\u2019s scale, it\u2019s worth looking at how one brand is integrating beverage insights from Collider into its menu and development strategy. KFC, which has seen dramatic international growth at the same time as its sales have eroded in the U.S., has a particularly important beverage innovation pipeline.\n\nThe insights generated by Collider\u2019s efforts and the speed with which drinks can be developed make the question of new menu development an operations question, rather than an ideas question, Kubizniak said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for us is how do we \u2026 bring it to life in our restaurants,\u201d Kubizniak said.\n\nThat\u2019s a challenge the brand has been working to overcome in the U.K., where it launched a premium, beverage-focused QSR brand \u2014 called Kwench by KFC \u2014 in 38 restaurants earlier this year. Kwench also has a presence in Australia.\n\nThe Kwench set up will require a coffee machine, milkshake machine and a back-of-house set up called the Kwench bench, Kubizniak said. Because the concept and the drinks are new, they will also entail a fair amount of employee training.\n\nBut early results have been encouraging. Customers have responded well to Kwench\u2019s menu lineup, particularly its crunchy milkshakes,and franchisees are excited about the beverage program. Texture plays a big role in distinguishing drinks, Kubizniak said.\n\nSome of the Kwench drinks, refreshers and lemonades, are good companions for fried chicken, but others could draw consumers on their own.\n\n\u201cMilkshakes and coffees \u2014 the more indulgent flavors \u2014 they're really a standalone purchase,\u201d Kubizniak. \u201c\u2018Come for the beverage, stay for the chicken,\u2019 is the mantra.\u201d\n\nKwench, Kubizniak said, will be a larger initiative, rather than a way to test individual drinks. But adding a new beverage program across the brand\u2019s franchise system requires finding the right equipment, formalizing a supply chain, determining the appropriate pricing, securing franchisee buy-in and ensuring all of this can be done in existing real estate. The U.K. and Australia will see significant expansions next year.\n\n\u201cWe have more tests planned in Mexico and South Africa and Poland, and then also, hopefully, in the U.S. this year,\u201d Kubizniak said.\n\nBut the U.S. market, where the brand has struggled to compete in recent years, will require other efforts before new beverages become a priority, Kubizniak said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Yum Brands' beverage strategy: Predicting trends years ahead for QSR growth.\n\n**Key details:** Yum Brands employs a 35-person unit, Collider Labs, to monitor consumer trends in real-time and predict flavor preferences years ahead. This strategic foresight is powered by what is described as \"the largest beverage database in the world.\" The company also utilizes prediction markets, asking consumers to bet on potential drink success, to narrow down and assess new drink options. This approach helps identify structural trends, like the consumer shift towards cold, convenient, and visually appealing QSR coffee. KFC, a Yum brand, is implementing these insights by launching a premium, beverage-focused brand \"Kwench by KFC\" in the U.K. and Australia.\n\n**Why it matters:** The QSR beverage market is expanding, offering brands a faster development cycle compared to traditional food items. Yum's data-driven approach aims to capture these trends years in advance, positioning restaurants to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This strategy could challenge the traditional view that QSRs are primarily food-driven, as beverages can become \"standalone purchases\" attracting customers on their own. It highlights a proactive approach to growth, particularly relevant for brands like KFC that have experienced U.S. sales erosion while expanding internationally. The focus on beverage innovation suggests a new lever for future growth, potentially shifting investor focus from core food items.\n\n**The big picture:** Fast food brands typically seek well-known but up-and-coming flavors to appeal to a wide range of consumers. Yum Brands' approach involves proactively looking at where culture and consumers are headed years ahead of time. Beverage trends often originate in higher-end, experiential restaurant concepts or international markets, with South Korea identified as a key source. QSR coffee drinks are nearing \"most advanced, yet accepted status\" due to a decade-and-a-half consumer shift towards cold, convenient, and visually appealing options. Yum's high standard for acceptability means new offerings must appeal to at least 50% of QSR consumers in the U.S. to be seriously considered.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **35:** Number of people in Yum's Collider Labs unit.\n*   **95%:** Percentage of U.S. consumers QSRs reach.\n*   **50%:** Minimum applicability to U.S. consumers for a new beverage concept to be interesting.\n*   **500+:** Number of consumers Yum asks to bet on drink success in each country.\n*   **38:** Number of KFC Kwench restaurants launched in the U.K.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Yum Brands:** Parent company implementing strategic beverage innovation based on advanced consumer trend monitoring.\n*   **Ken Muench:** Yum Brands Chief Marketing Officer, explains strategic foresight and Collider Labs' role.\n*   **Collider Labs:** 35-person Yum unit that monitors consumer trends, informing brands years ahead.\n*   **KFC:** Yum brand integrating beverage insights, launching the Kwench concept in some markets.\n*   **Val Kubizniak:** KFC\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer, highlights beverage development advantages and Kwench's rollout.\n*   **Taco Bell:** Yum brand cited for expanding QSR beverage opportunities with drinks like Churros Chillers.\n*   **PredictIt:** Example of a prediction market, similar to method Yum uses for drink success assessment.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Significant expansions of Kwench by KFC are planned for the U.K. and Australia next year.\n*   More Kwench tests are planned this year in Mexico, South Africa, Poland, and potentially the U.S.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Yum's data-driven beverage innovation seeks significant new QSR growth opportunities.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon\u2019s Q2 online store net sales rose 11% year over year to $61.5 billion, as physical store sales rose 7% to $5.6 billion, the e-commerce giant reported Thursday.\n\nRelated operations grew more in the period, with third-party seller services up 11% to $40.3 billion, advertising up 23% to $15.7 billion and subscription services up 12% to $12.2 billion.\n\nOn a call with analysts, CEO Andy Jassy touted additions to the assortment, including Away, Aveda and Marc Jacobs Fragrances; brands from the tie-up with Saks Global, including Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Stella McCartney, Rosetta Getty and La Prairie; and \u201cthe much requested return of Nike's products.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon\u2019s retail enterprise, while immense and growing, is increasingly in the shadow of adjacent businesses like advertising, subscriptions and marketplace seller services. In Q2 those operations grew as fast or faster than its online and physical stores and together netted more revenue. The company\u2019s stalwart cloud business also continues to be yet another boon to its e-commerce.\n\nOnline plus brick-and-mortar net sales topped $67 billion, while advertising plus subscription fees plus seller services, where growth was mostly higher, topped $68 billion. Sales at the AWS unit rose 17.5% year over year to nearly $31 billion.\n\n\u201cThe solid growth and profitability of AWS and advertising should continue to outperform and support Retail,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group analysts led by Joseph Feldman said in a note on the company\u2019s Q2 report.\n\nThis is a unique situation in retail, though Amazon is encountering many of the same challenges. Currently that includes uncertainty around tariffs.\n\n\u201cThere continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cMuch of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we can share is what we've seen thus far, which is that through the first half of the year, we haven't yet seen diminishing demand nor prices meaningfully appreciating,\u201d he also said.\n\nOne aspect of the Trump administration\u2019s trade policy \u2014 the end of the de minimis loophole on goods from China and elsewhere \u2014 could turn around the lackluster performance from Amazon Haul, the company\u2019s answer to ultra-cheap sites like Shein and Temu. Or at least mute the competition for a while.\n\n\u201cAmazon remains the main winner from the ongoing disruption to this part of the market,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. \u201cAdmittedly, this disruption will not last forever as both Shein and Temu will reformulate their approach \u2013 but a big part of their advantage has been lost for good, and that works in Amazon\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s push into rural areas will also soon pay off, according to Saunders. In June, Amazon announced plans to bring same- and next-day delivery to more than 4,000 small towns and rural communities by the end of the year, saying earlier in the year that it would invest more than $4 billion by 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe gains in any one area might be modest but given the sheer number of rural areas across America and the relative lack of retail competition within them, the gains for Amazon are significant,\u201d Saunders said.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Amazon's Q2: Services Outpace Retail, Tariffs Not Yet Impacting Demand.\n\n**Key details:** Amazon reported Q2 online store net sales increased 11% to $61.5 billion, with physical store sales rising 7% to $5.6 billion. Related operations, including third-party seller services, advertising, and subscription services, grew faster, up 11%, 23%, and 12% respectively. Sales from the AWS unit also grew 17.5% year over year to nearly $31 billion. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted new brand additions to the assortment, including Nike's products. Amazon's adjacent businesses together netted more revenue than online and brick-and-mortar sales in Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:** Amazon's Q2 results indicate that its adjacent businesses, such as advertising and third-party services, are now growing faster and contributing more revenue than its core retail operations. This suggests a significant shift in key revenue drivers and profit support for the company. The company\u2019s CEO noted that uncertainty around tariffs has not yet caused diminishing demand or meaningfully appreciating prices through the first half of the year. This challenges a potential consensus view that retail performance is the primary determinant of Amazon's growth and that tariffs are broadly impacting demand. Furthermore, the end of the de minimis loophole could mute competition for Amazon Haul from ultra-cheap sites.\n\n**The big picture:** Amazon's core retail enterprise, though immense, is increasingly overshadowed by its adjacent businesses like advertising, subscriptions, and marketplace seller services. These operations are growing as fast or faster than its online and physical stores and together netted more revenue in Q2. The company\u2019s stalwart cloud business, AWS, also continues to be a significant contributor to its e-commerce strength. While Amazon faces broader retail challenges, such as tariff uncertainty, it has not yet observed negative impacts on demand or prices. Strategic initiatives like expanding into rural areas are also noted for their potential future gains.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Online store net sales: $61.5 billion (up 11% year over year)\n*   Physical store sales: $5.6 billion (up 7%)\n*   Advertising sales: $15.7 billion (up 23%)\n*   AWS sales: nearly $31 billion (up 17.5% year over year)\n*   Advertising + subscription fees + seller services revenue: topped $68 billion\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Amazon:** E-commerce giant reporting strong Q2 growth across diverse business segments.\n*   **Andy Jassy:** Amazon CEO, discussed Q2 performance, new product additions, and tariff impacts.\n*   **Joseph Feldman:** Telsey Advisory Group analyst, stated AWS and advertising should outperform and support Retail.\n*   **Neil Saunders:** GlobalData Managing Director, commented on Amazon benefiting from market disruption and rural expansion.\n*   **Nike:** Brand whose products made a much requested return to Amazon's assortment.\n*   **Shein:** Ultra-cheap site mentioned as competition potentially muted by trade policy changes.\n*   **Temu:** Ultra-cheap site mentioned as competition potentially muted by trade policy changes.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Amazon plans to bring same- and next-day delivery to over 4,000 small towns and rural communities by the end of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Services and cloud drive Amazon's growth, overshadowing core retail.",

The electronics retailer lowered its full-year guidance due to the evolving trade policy landscape, now expecting a revenue range from $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion.\n\nThe new approach for Ikea also comes as the home decor and furniture brand expands its U.S. store count. Ikea in February revealed plans to open eight new locations across the country this year. The planning and pickup formatted stores will be located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon, Arizona and California.\n\nIkea U.S. also updated its loyalty rewards program in May, allowing shoppers to earn points on purchases and various engagements that can be exchanged for rewards such as free food and purchase discounts.",

Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we\u2019re still thinking about.\n\nFrom Petco\u2019s 60th anniversary to the future of Outdoor Voices, here\u2019s our closeout for the week.\n\nWhat you may have missed\n\nJ. McLaughlin names CEO\n\nApparel brand J. McLaughlin this week named Greg Unis chief executive officer. Unis had been serving as interim CEO since March.\n\n\u201cGreg\u2019s passion for design and brand-building make him the right leader for this pivotal moment,\u201d Kevin McLaughlin, co-founder of J. McLaughlin, said in a statement. \u201cHe understands what makes J. McLaughlin special and brings a fresh perspective to help us further engage with our customers and stay true to our roots.\u201d\n\nPrior to J. McLaughlin, Unis served as president of Victoria\u2019s Secret and Pink. He has also held senior executive roles at Coach, Brooks Brothers and Gap Inc.\n\nStaples expands partnership with Verizon\n\nStaples and Verizon have expanded their partnership, bringing the phone and internet carrier\u2019s kiosks to 35 Staples stores.\n\nThe initiative marks the start of a broader effort to bring \u201cmore wireless and tech services to Staples customers this year,\u201d the companies said in their announcement Thursday.\n\n\u201cAt Staples, we\u2019re focused on bringing in the right partners to deliver even more value to our customers and this collaboration with Verizon does exactly that,\u201d Marshall Warkentin, president of Staples U.S. Retail, said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re making essential wireless services more accessible for small businesses and everyday shoppers in the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nThe stores will open on a rolling basis through mid-August, with additional locations opening later in the year.\n\nTillys names a new CEO\n\nYouth apparel company Tillys announced that, effective Aug. 18, Nate Smith will step into the role of president, chief executive officer and director. Current CEO Hezy Shaked will transition to the executive chairman role also on that date, per a company press release.\n\nSmith joins the company from Marolina Outdoor, where he served as CEO. He also has leadership experience at Boardriders, Oakley and Patagonia, among other companies.\n\n\u201cTillys has had a strong track record of success over its 43-year history, and I am excited to work with Hezy, the Board and the team to revitalize and build upon that history,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nRetail therapy\n\nIHOP enters the Dubai chocolate ring\n\nPistachio shortage? If that\u2019s the case, IHOP hasn\u2019t gotten the memo. The famous breakfast foods chain is debuting two limited-edition Dubai chocolate-flavored pancake stacks on Monday in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin.\n\nThe first 25 guests will get the luxe Dubai chocolate pancake stack for free, featuring Madagascar vanilla whipped cream, a whole Dubai chocolate bar, edible 24K gold flakes and gold glitter. After that, guests can purchase a scaled-down version for $13, per a Wednesday press release.\n\nNo, you wear it on your head\n\nIn Prada\u2019s latest attempt to offer products to people who have more money than common sense, the fashion house is offering a cat basket and passing it off as a hat. The Straw Visor Cap currently sells on Saks Fifth Avenue for $2,800.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t vibing with the lampshade-on-your-head look, definitely pick up the company\u2019s holey Leather Visor for a lot less ($1,790) or a more traditional cotton baseball cap for $895.\n\nIs it a lampshade? Is it a hat? Can it be both? Retrieved from Saks Fifth Avenue on July 30, 2025\n\nWhat we\u2019re still thinking about\n\n12.6%\n\nThat\u2019s how much Purple's second quarter net revenue declined year over year.\n\nThe mattress company attributed the drop to \u201cdelays in the timing of Rejuvenate 2.0 shipments, lapping reductions in wholesale door count from 2024, and softness in ecommerce.\u201d Still, executives sounded upbeat on the full year, reiterating guidance and saying on an earnings call Tuesday that the brand expects its showrooms to become profitable in 2025.\n\n60\n\nThat\u2019s how old Petco is this year. The retailer, a brick-and-mortar stalwart, started off as a veterinary supply mail-order business. Acquiring two pet-supply rivals in 1988 tripled its store footprint, and its expansion continued well into the 21st century. More recently, the chain has struggled, though, and it\u2019s now pursuing a turnaround under new leadership.\n\nFor its anniversary this month, Petco is hosting tastings, promotions and adoption events, including a birthday party Aug. 16 at stores nationwide. From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time, pets and their families get various treats, with gift bags going to the first 60 customers. The festivities culminate on Aug. 26, National Dog Day, with special deals and an Instagram giveaway for a chance to win a Petco shopping spree.\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nThe return of Outdoor Voices\n\nAfter an abrupt closure of its store footprint last year and a sale to Consortium Brand Partners, Outdoor Voices is back with new product and its old founder. Ty Haney has rejoined the brand as founder, owner and partner, and led the nine-month-long design process of the brand\u2019s new collection, launching next week.\n\nThe move has already sparked plenty of discourse about what Outdoor Voices will accomplish this time around, with fans peppering the brand\u2019s Instagram with comments about which products to bring back and general excitement for the reveal. Many also praised the return of Haney herself, who left the brand in 2020 under tumultuous circumstances.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all exercise dress bliss. The brand\u2019s posts have also become home to customers airing grievances about certain style changes in the new collection \u2014 including a sweater with a sparkly \u201cDoing Things\u201d bedazzled on the front \u2014 as well as complaints about limited sizing and months-old order mishaps.\n\nWith Haney back at the helm and the deeper resources of a parent company, can Outdoor Voices regain its spot in activewear shoppers\u2019 closets?",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEtsy\u2019s flagship marketplace continued to struggle in Q2. Gross merchandise sales fell 5.4% year over year to $2.4 billion, and its number of active buyers fell 4.6% to 87.3 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s smaller U.K.-based Depop marketplace fared better, with GMS up 35.3% to $249.6 million; U.S. GMS grew 54%.\n\nOverall at the company GMS fell 4.8% to $2.8 billion, while revenue rose 3.8% to $672.7 million. Net income reached $28.8 million, down by $24.2 million compared to last year. The number of active buyers dropped by 3.4% to 93.3 million.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEtsy Inc. is working to inject strength into its flagship marketplace as declines in various metrics continued in Q2, and the company is betting that mobile will provide a much-needed boost.\n\n\u201cThe app is key to our flywheel,\u201d CEO Joshua Silverman told analysts Wednesday. \u201cToday, it's not just different than a year ago. It's markedly better, more intuitive, more inspiring and a lot more browseable, with the introduction of multiple new features you can see by simply opening the app homepage.\u201d\n\nIn Q2, GMS on the marketplace\u2019s app outpaced non-app GMS and reached nearly 45% of total GMS, he said.\n\nThe company aims to dial down its marketing via linear cable television to about a low single-digit percentage of its U.S. brand media spend and \u201cdramatically\u201d shift to more marketing via streaming platforms, Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal said. The company is also turning more to \u201cpartnerships and influencers to build awareness and credibility,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese efforts go hand-in-hand with our work to build a better app experience,\u201d Goyal said. \u201cSo that when we reach buyers, they land on an engaging intuitive shopping experience that both inspires and enables them to browse and explore.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s once-trailblazing search ranking models are \u201cnot the right fit for where the future of personalized shopping experiences are headed,\u201d she also said, citing conversations with newly returned Chief Technology Officer Rafe Colburn.\n\n\u201cSo we're retooling our ranking platform to more effectively leverage capabilities of LLMs in generative AI, allowing us to understand our listings, users and their activity much more deeply as we work to deliver better search results,\u201d Goyal said. \u201cAnd we're creating more diverse and engaging recommendations by scoring items across a very broad range of interests and clustering them to capture nonobvious connections to encourage discovery.\u201d\n\nThe approach will improve Etsy\u2019s ability to predict and match buyer interest over time, as it has already at Depop, she said.\n\nGoyal underscored the role of sellers as well. Marketplaces from Poshmark to Amazon have adjusted various seller policies in the past several months; in April Etsy added tools for sellers. The site\u2019s fees and other policies have upset sellers in the past, but Goyal told analysts that work to enable sellers is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWhile most marketplaces push sellers into the background, we have the opportunity to bring sellers to the forefront,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're finding ways to better highlight the sellers behind the items and create more seamless connections between them and buyers throughout the shopping journey, from the listing page to the custom order process and direct conversations.\u201d\n\nEtsy completed the sale of Reverb on June 2; the company acquired the secondhand musical instrument site six years ago.",

Overall company GMS dropped 4.8% to $2.8 billion, despite revenue rising 3.8% to $672.7 million. Net income decreased significantly to $28.8 million, down $24.2 million year over year. The company is retooling its search ranking platform with LLMs and generative AI. Etsy is also shifting marketing from linear television and focusing on app experience, where GMS reached nearly 45%.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe ongoing declines in Etsy\u2019s core marketplace GMS and active buyers signal persistent challenges for its main business. Management explicitly states its \"once-trailblazing search ranking models\" are \"not the right fit,\" indicating a fundamental strategy shift. This challenges any prior consensus that existing search and marketing strategies were sufficient for growth. The company's significant bet on mobile, AI, and new marketing channels reflects an urgent pivot. Success of these new initiatives is critical to stemming further GMS declines and reactivating buyers.\n\n**The big picture:**\nEtsy Inc. faces continued declines in its flagship marketplace, prompting a strategic overhaul. The company is moving away from its older search ranking models, deemed no longer suitable for personalized shopping. A significant marketing shift is underway, transitioning from linear cable television to streaming platforms and influencer partnerships. These changes aim to improve the mobile app experience, which is seen as critical to driving future growth. Etsy also recently completed the sale of Reverb, a secondhand musical instrument site.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Flagship marketplace GMS: Down 5.4% to $2.4 billion in Q2.\n*   Overall company GMS: Down 4.8% to $2.8 billion.\n*   Revenue: Rose 3.8% to $672.7 million.\n*   Net income: $28.8 million, down $24.2 million year over year.\n*   Depop GMS: Up 35.3% to $249.6 million (U.S. GMS up 54%).\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Etsy Inc.:** The core company reporting Q2 financial struggles and new strategic initiatives.\n*   **Depop:** Etsy's U.K.-based marketplace, showing significant GMS growth in Q2.\n*   **Reverb:** A secondhand musical instrument site previously owned by Etsy, sold on June 2.\n*   **Joshua Silverman:** Etsy's CEO, emphasized the app's critical role in the company's strategy.\n*   **Kruti Patel Goyal:** Etsy's Chief Growth Officer, detailed marketing shifts and AI-driven search retooling.\n*   **Rafe Colburn:** Etsy's newly returned Chief Technology Officer, involved in retooling the search platform.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nEtsy's core business faces headwinds, betting on tech and app for recovery.",

In Chicago, they\u2019re down 38% since 2020. Newark has seen a more than 60% reduction in violent crime and homicides over the past decade.\n\nThese statistics are not a result of zero-tolerance, tough-on-crime policies, the mayors of these cities said during a media briefing held Thursday by the Democratic Mayors Association and the justice advocacy group Vera Action. Rather, they attributed the reduction in violent crime to investments in community-focused solutions such as targeted policing, violence intervention, mental health services and youth employment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a remarkable moment here, halfway through 2025,\u201d said Insha Rahman, Vera Institute of Justice vice president of advocacy and partnerships. Nationwide, homicides are down 22.6%, overall violent crime is down 6.4% and property crime has dropped by 8.8% since 2020, she said.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s really important to note is that there were huge amounts of federal and local dollars \u2014 millions, maybe even billions \u2014 put into community-based solutions for safety,\u201d Rahman said. At the same time, she noted, \u201coverall, the number of police was down between 5% to 10%, so that wasn't actually the driver of these remarkable gains in community safety.\u201d\n\nChicago has reduced crime by strategically deploying officers, partnering with community violence intervention groups and investing in mental health clinics and youth employment programs in the city\u2019s 35 most violent police beats, said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. The city has also worked to repair \u201chistoric distrust\u201d between the residents and police officers based on what he called \u201cdecades of bad policing\u201d targeting the Black community.\n\nToday, Johnson said, constitutional policing plays a role in crime reduction, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the only body of government or entity of government that should be responsible for the challenges that we are experiencing.\u201d\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said his city has \u201cthe lowest amount of violent crime and homicides that we\u2019ve seen [to date this year] in the history of this city.\u201d He attributed this to a focus on deterrence and investments in community violence intervention and hospital-based response programs, as well as in recreation and parks in historically overlooked neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe all know that zero-tolerance and lock-up-everyone-Black and lock-up-everyone-poor policing didn't work,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt's never been about how many arrests a police department is making. It's about who and for what and the certainty of accountability for everyone.\u201d\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka attributed his city\u2019s over 60% reduction in violent crime and homicides to a decade-long coordinated intervention strategy involving hospitals, community organizations, public safety roundtables designed to build trust between police and community members, and intelligence-based policing that targets the most violent individuals and neighborhoods.\n\nHe and Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, president of the Democratic Mayors Association, decried the Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of hundreds of public safety grants in April, saying it will affect many of these programs.",

Nationwide, homicides are down 22.6% and overall violent crime 6.4% since 2020. City mayors and justice advocates attribute these reductions to investments in community-focused solutions such as violence intervention and mental health services. They explicitly state these gains were not due to \"tough-on-crime\" policies, noting police numbers were down 5% to 10%.\n\n**Why it matters:** This data challenges the conventional wisdom that increased policing and \"tough-on-crime\" policies are the primary drivers of crime reduction. The article suggests that significant federal and local funds allocated to community-based solutions were more effective. This shift in strategy could influence future public safety spending and investment priorities away from traditional law enforcement sectors. It implies that alternative models of public safety offer proven results, potentially redirecting resources.\n\n**The big picture:** Democratic mayors and justice advocacy groups held a briefing to highlight successful crime reduction strategies. Their message challenges the idea that \"zero-tolerance\" policing is effective, citing \"decades of bad policing.\" Instead, they point to significant federal and local investments in community-based safety solutions as the driver for reduced crime.

The agency said it needs to begin planning for a 40% cut in service for the Chicago Transit Authority and Metra commuter railroad, with the loss of nearly 3,000 transit jobs.\n\nThe House and Senate bills would reorganize the transit system under a regional entity called the Northern Illinois Transit Authority.

The legislation would also create a statewide $1.50 package-delivery fee and a fee on businesses engaging in electric vehicle charging to help fund the transit system.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes a mandate to buy only zero-emission buses. However, these come at a higher price than traditional transit buses and have large production backlogs.

Over the past month, the U.S. has experienced dangerous and deadly flash flooding and extreme heat. Projections for the 2025 wildfire season in the Western U.S. indicate significantly increased fire potential driven by drought expansion and above-average temperatures. Meanwhile, the 2025 U.S. tornado season is on track to be above the 30-year historical average, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season.\n\nBesides the devastating loss of life and the damage inflicted by these types of events, they have something else in common: they often leave communities without power to meet critical needs. Despite the inevitable occurrence of these events, there is good news for people in the paths of these natural disasters.\n\nThe power sector is not waiting around to reactively address damage from the next severe weather event. Hurricanes or extreme heat may be seasonal, but preparation is not.\n\nA coalition of more than 40 energy providers and system operators \u2014 along with 100 academics, policymakers, non-profits, government agencies and others \u2014 have worked together to develop a data-driven, science-based framework to improve the resilience and reliability of the power system.\n\nThe public Climate READi framework, issued and developed by independent, non-profit energy R&D institute EPRI, guides energy companies in assessing risk and vulnerability in the energy system across a wide variety of weather and climate conditions. In addition, utilities, regulators and other stakeholders can use this set of guidance, references and tools to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments and adapt the evolving electric system to the climate of the future.\n\nThe framework, developed over the past three years, highlights how factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience to climate hazards. Knowing the exposure of assets and systems to current and future climate hazards and pinpointing system vulnerabilities at the asset and company level is key for determining which adaptation strategies to consider for any region. It\u2019s important to note there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer, as a West Coast utility may need to prepare against wildfires versus an East Coast utility, which may more frequently deal with ice storms. Having different options for what best suits individual utilities will be key to proactive planning for these events.\n\nSo how do companies conduct climate-informed planning and analysis?\n\nFirst, the framework recommends having a dedicated team with clear ownership and responsibility. Once in place, the framework recommends the team begin with in-depth and iterative scoping, setting expectations among internal and external stakeholders to define the bounds and objectives of the assessment, while also integrating information from previous impacts of weather and climate events on asset or system performance. This involves the selection of climate data and vulnerability information that characterizes baseline conditions and captures the range of expected future conditions.\n\nSecond, the framework recommends conducting model-based evaluations across an integrated modeling platform, where data and assumptions are used consistently throughout. The company may also want to review its existing integrated resource plans, regulatory filings, or other planning documents to identify plausible future configurations of its portfolio.\n\nThird, it is important to ensure the load data used for planning and evaluation reflects the weather dependency for the selected conditions and technologies being evaluated.\n\nLastly, the framework recommends comparing baseline model results to results with the various adaptations in place to determine the anticipated benefits and cost effectiveness of options under consideration. This comparison can be used to justify and prioritize adaptation investments.\n\nWork has and will continue to be underway to proactively plan for the weather of the future. For example, last year, researchers from EPRI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory mapped how future hurricanes could affect power outage risk. Working with PNNL, we combined synthetic hurricane tracks in a future climate with a predictive power outage model, developed using power outage data from 23 historical hurricanes that affected the continental United States and Puerto Rico between 2016 and 2023. This allowed us to assess changes in outage risk in the 2066-2100 timeframe compared to today\u2019s climate. According to the models, the average person in the metropolitan areas of Houston, New Orleans and Boston could see expected outage events increase by more than 70% per decade, while Miami residents may see a 119% increase.\n\nAs this analysis shows, there isn\u2019t one clear answer, since different locations have different needs and weather conditions. Regardless of where you live, it\u2019s clear that a common, consistent and collaborative framework for physical climate risk \u2014 and available to all parties \u2014 is needed to ensure the reliable, resilient and affordable power system of the future for all of us.",

This data-driven, science-based framework guides energy companies in assessing climate risk and vulnerability across various weather conditions. Developed over three years, it recommends dedicated teams, model-based evaluations, and cost-effective adaptation strategies to boost energy system resilience. The framework emphasizes tailoring solutions to specific regional hazards, like wildfires for the West Coast or ice storms for the East Coast. Its aim is to help utilities, regulators, and stakeholders prioritize investments and adapt the electric system for future climate conditions.\n\n**Why it matters:** Extreme weather events, including projected increases in wildfires and hurricanes, frequently cause widespread power outages, impacting critical community needs. The power sector is proactively addressing this, shifting from reactive damage control to preventive measures. This framework challenges the traditional reactive approach by highlighting that factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience. This proactive investment strategy can potentially lead to more reliable service and lower long-term costs for utilities, benefiting investors by reducing exposure to climate-related operational disruptions.\n\n**The big picture:** The U.S. has recently experienced dangerous flash flooding and extreme heat, with projections for 2025 indicating significantly increased wildfire potential and an above-average tornado season.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nArtificial intelligence is changing the face of waste education. City staff and facility operators are looking beyond paper mailers and public service announcements to cameras, screens and text prompts. The technology is designed to meet users at the bins and help them navigate the complexities of local recycling rules.\n\nAI has been used to identify items and trigger physical separation within materials recovery facilities for years, and more recently it\u2019s even been implemented to track contamination levels at the point of collection when haulers integrate camera systems into their trucks. But neither of these use cases go as far upstream as trying to help consumers make the right decision about where to put their refuse, recyclables or organics.\n\n\u201cThis was really an effort to help people better understand small nuances, and it also gave us new insights about common questions and gaps in knowledge,\u201d said Pamela Perez, marketing manager for LA Sanitation & Environment, which recently introduced Professor Green, an AI tool for organics recycling education.\n\nProponents of these AI feedback systems hope they can cut down on contamination and increase capture rates, but the technology is still evolving.\n\nWhether the tools are chatbots or item-identifying cameras, operators have to tinker with the software over time and hone its ability to offer users the right responses. Experts say accurate item identification \u2014 particularly at the curb, where trash and recycling come in an almost infinite number of forms \u2014 could be a challenge for some iterations of this consumer-facing AI. Another hurdle will be convincing consumers to use it.\n\nSend a text or take a photo\n\nContamination rates remain stubbornly high, as recycling rates are also stagnant in many parts of the U.S.\n\nIn New York City, for example, non-recyclable contaminants in the metal, plastic and glass waste stream have increased from nearly 34 pounds to almost 49 pounds per household between 2017 and 2023. The Recycling Partnership estimated in 2020 that the inbound material contamination rate was 17%.\n\nWaste and recycling professionals hoping to improve these statistics are looking to AI as enabling coaching for residents and visitors on the spot.\n\nA rendering of Oscar Sort\u2019s AI-enable sorting technology, which uses cameras to help people decide where to place their items at airports, universities and other public areas. Permission granted by Intuitive AI\n\nSome public-facing AI sorting systems identify items the same way MRF technologies do. Oscar Sort, a platform offered by Intuitive AI, uses a camera to see what a user is holding. A follow-up message on a mounted screen shows which bin to drop it in \u2014 trash, recycling, compost, or even (as one client requested) a chopstick-only receptacle for a recycling service that turns them into wooden furniture. The software can also offer multi-part instructions, like directing a coffee cup to the trash bin and a cardboard sleeve to the recycling bin.\n\nIn the U.S., facilities such as the San Francisco Ferry Building and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport are in the early stages of using Oscar on site. The company says over 25 airports and 50 universities asked to become customers in the last year.\n\nEach Oscar installation costs $10,000 to $15,000, after which yearly services and data fees cost $5,500 to $6,500, said Brian Sano, head of strategy at Intuitive AI. In 2024, the company launched an ad-based offering \u2014 brands can pay to advertise on the embedded screens, generating potentially enough revenue for the facility to cover annual maintenance costs and then some.\n\nConsumer-facing sorting AI can also take in what the public offers via text, which is how the city of Los Angeles opted for its technology to operate.\n\nProfessor Green, the AI educator built for the city by software company Hello Lamp Post, works like a chatbot. Users in one of four pilot neighborhoods \u2014 Porter Ranch, Northridge, South LA and Watts \u2014 scan a QR code or go to the city website to text Professor Green. The system replies to tell users if their item can go in a city-provided green bin or their trash or recycling bins. The chatbot understands and replies to English, Spanish, Korean, Tagalog, Ethiopian and Armenian \u2014 languages selected to best serve populations in the pilot area.\n\nIdeally, Professor Green clears up local confusion about composting rules. The City of Los Angeles has a lot of residents who move in to the municipality and might not be familiar with local guidelines, Perez said, or need help parsing the rules from those of nearby areas. For example, some of the other municipalities in Los Angeles County ask that residents line their bins with compostable bags, but the city of Los Angeles only accepts paper-product liners.\n\nToo few trash photos\n\nBoth Intuitive AI and LA Sanitation staff dip into the data to make sure their programs are identifying items correctly.\n\nIntuitive AI does this for Oscar customers by comparing the instructions Oscar offers to recordings of what the user was holding, every day, along with four waste audits a year for most customers.\n\nLA Sanitation staff also comb through Professor Green requests every day. They spend at most an hour on the inquiries, which is often more than enough time to spot any issues. For example, staff taught the AI to respond to questions about tamale waste but soon realized it didn\u2019t know corn husks were part of the food. Perez said the team has since instructed Professor Green to associate the two.\n\nText-based sorting inquiries will likely give users more accurate instructions than camera-based technology, said Sharon Hsiao, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University.\n\nThat\u2019s because having people tell the AI what they\u2019re trying to dispose of gets around the issue of having to train the software to recognize what trash looks like. Written prompts can still run a wide range. As Perez pointed out, her office had a long list of terms for \u201cpet waste\u201d that Professor Green needed to recognize. But visual identification has even more variability.\n\n\u201cCigarette butts or COVID masks \u2014 those are very distinct,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cBut if you crumple up paper, it won\u2019t always be the same shape.\u201d\n\nThere are also few photos of trash that are freely available for AI models to learn from.\n\nHsiao and her colleagues tried to compile a database of these publicly accessible training images when building an AI waste sorter that relies on a smartphone camera. Not only were there too few images to train the software, but the computational power that would be needed for the AI to recognize any possible item goes beyond anything a smart phone can handle, Hsiao said.\n\nAn AI system focused on waste requires a small computer and is more likely to be accurate if developers can train the software to recognize a limited array of items, Hsiao said. Places that restrict the kinds of materials allowed inside, like entertainment venues or airports, could be a natural fit.\n\nLower barriers are better\n\nExperts expect technology to play an increasing role as local governments and facility operators look for ways to evolve their recycling education. But figuring out what will resonate with the public is an ongoing process.\n\nAI-enabled camera systems might be easier for users, despite being harder to teach. In surveys, Hsiao and her team found that people are likely to think of texting or responding to voice prompts as more work than waiting for a camera to register what it\u2019s seeing. And all of these options were considered significantly more time-consuming than the status quo \u2014the split-second decision of throwing items into whichever bin it seems to belong.\n\n\u201cAll the people that we surveyed wanted to be able to use their phone to scan items to tell them which bin it's supposed to be in,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cIn reality, they actually don't do it.\u201d\n\nTo convince people to take the time and use the AI identification they claim to want, Hsiao and her colleagues are working on a sorting system that also tells users about the benefits of their actions. Her team is experimenting with feedback about money or greenhouse gas emissions saved via correct sorting.\n\nFor now, the simpler text-based Professor Green option appears to be resonating. Los Angelenos have had over 4,000 conversations with the AI since its debut in March. Use has been particularly high in South LA, a low-income neighborhood where the majority of households speak Spanish at home.\n\nLA Sanitation is now looking at expanding Professor Green to other neighborhoods in the future. But to know for certain whether the AI system is meaningfully changing contamination rates or diverting more material from landfills, Perez and her team would have to see the results of a more old-fashioned tool: a waste audit.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Waste Dive: Recycling newsletter.

These technologies include camera-based systems like Oscar Sort, which visually identify items and provide sorting instructions on screens. Text-based chatbots, such as Professor Green in Los Angeles, allow users to text questions and receive guidance on local recycling rules.

But 33 states may miss their goals for funding or meeting the desired condition of roads and bridges, even with an influx of funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, according to Pew.\n\nPew found that state data was inconsistent across the country. A majority of states reported some of the information needed to assess gaps in their transportation policy, while 26 only have projections and gap analyses for funding and road conditions.\n\n\u201cWithout such comprehensive information, policymakers may not be able to easily connect funding shortfalls with the inability to meet condition targets and understand the scale of the challenge,\u201d the Pew report states.\n\nBut even inconsistent data revealed troubling issues. New York reported that nearly 28% of lane miles on its non-interstate pavement were in poor condition in 2022, while Arkansas said 46% of lane miles were below its target condition, per the Pew report.\n\nCalifornia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas were among 29 states that reported a projected gap in their ability to keep roads and bridges properly maintained over the following 10 years.\n\nPew recommends that states improve reporting, using clear standards and data on the National Highway System, which includes interstate highways, major roads and those considered essential to the military, and other non-NHS roads. This information \u201ccan provide critical information for policymaking,\u201d Pew states.\n\nWhile states have largely spent most of their pandemic-era relief funds, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $1.2 trillion in funding for transportation and infrastructure over a five-year period, including some $350 billion for federal highway programs. With help from this influx of federal funds, states increased the percentage of their average transportation spending from 6.8% in 2022 to 8% in fiscal year 2024, according to the latest National Association of State Budget Officers report.\n\nOn average, total state spending for transportation grew more than 21% in fiscal 2024 because of increased state and federal funds, according to the NASBO report. \u201cIn recent years states have prioritized transportation spending directing additional state funding to both maintaining roads and other infrastructure, as well as supporting new projects,\u201d the report states.",

This shortfall could prevent proper maintenance, impacting safety, economic development, and future budget needs. Despite recent federal funds from pandemic-era acts, 33 states may miss their funding or desired condition goals. State data consistency is an issue, but even inconsistent data reveals troubled infrastructure conditions like in New York and Arkansas.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe anticipated funding shortfall for states challenges the effectiveness of recent significant federal investments in infrastructure. Despite the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorizing $1.2 trillion, a majority of states still project maintenance gaps. This suggests that the current consensus view that federal funds will fully address infrastructure issues might be overly optimistic. The inability to properly maintain roads and bridges could hinder economic development and necessitate larger future budget allocations. Inconsistent state data further complicates policymaking, making it difficult to connect shortfalls to condition targets.\n\n**The big picture:**\nStates have historically struggled to make necessary investments to preserve and maintain their transportation systems.

Minneapolis; Gainesville, Florida; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, have all eliminated single family zoning, allowing multifamily housing citywide.\n\nHome to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville attracts a large number of students and professionals, Pinkston said. But until 2024, the city had \u201cvery restrictive zoning in terms of what could be built,\u201d he said.\n\nCharlottesville\u2019s ordinance updated the city\u2019s zoning map, rolled back regulations requiring a certain number of parking spaces in housing developments and allowed duplexes to be built throughout the city \u2014 effectively eliminating single-family zoning. The changes made it easier to build housing and add housing density throughout the city, Pinkston said.\n\n\u201cWe see it as a tool in addressing the housing affordability crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some states and cities, those reforms have received pushback, including lawsuits. Six Colorado cities sued the state over a pair of laws that required communities to ease their local land-use regulations to allow for more housing construction, for example.\n\nA group of residents sued Charlottesville shortly after it passed its ordinance, arguing that the city did not follow the proper process before adopting it, the city stated on its website.\n\nA Charlottesville Circuit Court judge granted a default judgement in the case on June 30 after the city\u2019s outside counsel failed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint by a required deadline. That voided the 2024 zoning ordinance, which had replaced the old one, leaving the city without a zoning code in place, the city stated.\n\nAs a result, the city placed all zoning-related applications on hold, affecting new construction, additions, site modifications and changes in land use, the city stated on July 11. It continued processing building permit applications such as trade and fire permits.\n\nThe city is in talks with the residents and their counsel to settle the case. If needed, it will ask the court to reconsider or will file an appeal, the city stated.\n\nWhile the city\u2019s legal counsel attempts to resolve the issue, the City Council is also working to re-adopt the 2024 zoning code. Last week, it passed a resolution to refer the amended code to the city\u2019s Planning Commission for review and recommendations. According to the resolution, the commission is required to hold a public hearing and report its findings and recommendations to the City Council within 100 days after its next meeting.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Charlottesville Zoning Ordinance Voided, Halting Development Applications\n\n**Key details:** The 2024 zoning ordinance, adopted unanimously in December 2023, was voided by a state judge, leading Charlottesville to pause all zoning application approvals. This ordinance had eliminated single-family zoning and parking space requirements at new developments. The judge granted a default judgment on June 30 because the city\u2019s outside counsel failed to respond to a plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint by a required deadline. As a result, the city is left without a zoning code, halting new construction, additions, and changes in land use.\n\n**Why it matters:** The voided ordinance aimed to increase housing density and address Charlottesville's housing affordability crisis, aligning with a national trend of zoning reforms in cities like Minneapolis and Cambridge. Its invalidation means the city's efforts to ease housing construction and add density are currently halted. This situation challenges the immediate expectation of increased housing supply in Charlottesville, potentially impacting developers and investors who anticipated easier building processes. The pause on all zoning-related applications affects new construction and site modifications.\n\n**The big picture:** Charlottesville joined a growing number of U.S. cities and states in 2023 by reforming its zoning code to allow greater housing density, aiming to address high housing costs. Previously, the city, which attracts many students and professionals due to the University of Virginia, had very restrictive zoning. Such reforms have faced pushback elsewhere, including lawsuits in some states and cities. In Charlottesville's case, a group of residents sued, alleging the city did not follow the proper process for adoption.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Adopted:** December 2023\n*   **Took effect:** 2024\n*   **Default judgment:** June 30\n*   **Applications on hold announced:** July 11\n*   **Planning Commission report timeframe:** 100 days (after its next meeting)\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Brian Pinkston**: Charlottesville\u2019s vice mayor, stated the ordinance aimed to address the city\u2019s housing affordability crisis.\n*   **University of Virginia**: Based in Charlottesville, it contributes to attracting a large number of students and professionals.\n*   **Charlottesville City Council**: Unanimously adopted the voided zoning ordinance and is now working to re-adopt it.\n*   **Charlottesville Planning Commission**: Tasked with reviewing the amended zoning code and reporting recommendations to City Council.\n*   **Six Colorado cities**: Sued their state over laws that required easing local land-use regulations for housing construction.\n*   **Minneapolis, Gainesville, Florida, Cambridge, Massachusetts**: Cities that have eliminated single-family zoning, allowing multifamily housing citywide.\n*   **Maine, Montana, Colorado, Massachusetts**: States that have reformed zoning codes to allow greater housing density.\n*   **Group of residents**: Sued Charlottesville, arguing the city did not follow proper process, leading to ordinance void.\n*   **Charlottesville Circuit Court judge**: Granted default judgment, voiding the 2024 zoning ordinance due to city\u2019s legal counsel failure.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The city is in talks with residents and their counsel to settle the case.\n*   The Planning Commission is required to hold a public hearing and report recommendations within 100 days after its next meeting.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Charlottesville's housing density efforts are stalled, awaiting legal and legislative resolution.",

HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant program, which distributes approximately $3.5 billion annually, would also be refocused to favor \u201clocalities with above-median housing costs and above-median rates of growth\u201d and put new reporting requirements for grant recipients in place, Reason reported.",

        "summary_text": "A year after Capital One Financial announced a community benefits program in connection with its proposal to buy Discover Financial Services, the card issuer giant is still short on specifics.\n\nLast July, Capital One announced the eye-popping $265 billion plan to invest in communities where it offers its banking services, in collaboration with the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, NeighborWorks America, the Opportunity Finance Network and the Woodstock Institute. In the months since the plan was announced, the partnering organizations have yet to flesh out the details for the plan\u2019s execution and what it might mean for the people they serve.\n\nImmediately after the plan was announced last July, there were numerous press inquiries and conversations with the company, Woodstock Institute CEO Horacio Mendez said in a May interview. But as the newness of the announcement faded, \u201cthere really wasn\u2019t anything for us to do but wait,\u201d Mendez said.\n\nMeanwhile, critics assert that the community benefits plan dollar figure is inflated, and some worry the bank may not stick to the plan in a political environment that has changed since the re-election of President Donald Trump.\n\nFederal agencies shift gears on CRA\n\nSupport for that fear emerged this month when the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a notice to rescind a 2023 plan to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nThat rule update, proposed during the Biden administration, would have increased regulatory requirements for banks seeking to satisfy the 1977 law aimed at increasing financial inclusion and improving access to credit for low-income and minority communities.\n\nThe rule update was initially scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2024, but after bank groups sued the federal agencies to halt the edict that year, implementation dates for substantive portions of the revised rule were delayed to 2025 and 2026. In March, the Trump administration told an appellate court overseeing the litigation that it would move to rescind the rule update. Aside from increasing regulatory burdens, critics of the rule update have contended it increased uncertainty for banks while the two sides battled in court.\n\nWhile 1995 regulations remain in place for now, the litigation has left banks wondering whether or not they needed to change course, the Fed vice chair for supervision, Michelle Bowman, has said. The older version of the rule gave financial institutions more leeway to balance the needs of local communities with the \u201csafe and sound operation\u201d of their businesses, the three agencies said in their rescission proposal.\n\n\u201cReturning to the 1995 CRA regulations at this time, in staff\u2019s view, would confirm for banks that they do not need to allocate resources toward preparing for the 2023 CRA Final Rule,\u201d the July 16 federal agencies\u2019 proposal said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan?\n\nAs the Trump administration was reversing course on the rule update, Capital One closed its acquisition of Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover in May.\n\nIn conjunction with swallowing the card network, Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan proposed $44 billion in \u201ccommunity development financing,\u201d $600 million for community development financial institutions, and $575 million in philanthropy over five years. In addition, it proposed $200 billion in lending to low- to middle-income consumers; $15 billion for small business lending and $5 billion in \u201cspending with diverse suppliers\u201d over that period, the company said in a July 2024 press release.\n\nThe $600 million directed to the financial institutions for \u201caffordable housing, small business, and consumer lending\u201d was six times what Cap One and Discover had previously planned, the release said.\n\nThough Capital One consulted with the four organizations to develop the plan, it has not yet determined how the plan will be implemented, leaders for the organizations said in interviews.\n\nIn an April interview, Marla Bilonick, president and CEO of the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, said the group would soon be \u201cgetting down to brass tacks and executing on it.\u201d In a follow-up email sent via her spokesperson, Bilonick said this month that NALCAB couldn\u2019t comment further on the status of their talks until after the organization meets with Capital One.\n\nWoodstock\u2019s Mendez noted in May that Capital One had scheduled a meeting in the next week or so to reconnect and discuss the plan\u2019s execution nationally and in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe Woodstock Institute, a research and policy nonprofit focused on \u201ceconomic justice and racial equity within financial systems,\u201d has since had conversations with Capital One in which they discussed possibly arranging town halls with the public to assess the location of a Capital One Caf\u00e9 in Chicago. The bank\u2019s caf\u00e9s are retail branches that double as a place for consumers to grab coffee and food, meet with friends or work on a laptop.\n\nThe nonprofit and the bank also discussed arranging meetings with other local nonprofits and hiring one or two new staffers to manage the bank\u2019s Chicago commitments, Mendez noted in a follow-up email to Payments Dive.\n\nMendez said he has had regular meetings with Capital One\u2019s policy team, and the company is responsive to his calls and emails. \u201cSo far, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about our ability to have honest and challenging communication about stuff that we like and stuff that we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d Mendez said in May.\n\nNeighborWorks America and the Opportunity Finance Network declined multiple requests for comment. Payments Dive filed an open records request with NeighborWorks, a congressionally chartered nonprofit focused on affordable housing, asking for records regarding its involvement in Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan. The organization has not supplied any records responsive to the April 15 request, despite noting on its website that it\u2019s subject to the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nNo specific plan for program dollars\n\nIn an interview, Capital One\u2019s executive vice president and head of external affairs, Andy Navarrete, offered few specifics about implementation of the plan beyond the initial press release. In that June interview, he disputed the notion that the partner organizations weren\u2019t informed about the execution of the community benefits plan. He emphasized that the plan was contingent on the deal closing, noting that just happened in May. By way of explanation, he also underscored the plan\u2019s five-year duration.\n\n\u201cWhen you sort of think about the dollar commitments, they are going to be allocated and implemented over that period of time,\u201d Navarrete said. \u201cSo, it shouldn't be surprising at all that we haven't specifically defined exactly where all of those dollars are going today.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed that it had its kick-off meeting with its partners and plans to work with them to implement the community benefits agreement, but did not disclose when the meeting occurred.\n\n\u201cWith an investment this meaningful, and a five-year deployment plan, we are taking a thoughtful approach and actively working with our community partners to plan the most effective way to invest and drive positive impact,\u201d a spokesperson for the bank said in a follow-up email. \u201cTo date, we have provided meaningfully more transparency into the detail of our plan than any prior CBP negotiated by other parties. We are committed to continuing to be transparent while we deliver in the years to come.\u201d\n\nCapital One has met with its key collaborators, and the company plans to meet with members of its Community Advisory Council, who also contributed to formation of the plan, Navarrete said during the June interview.\n\nAs part of the plan, the Woodstock Institute pushed for Capital One to retain a Discover customer care center in the Chatham neighborhood on Chicago's South Side; to open two caf\u00e9s in Illinois; and to maintain its three current caf\u00e9s in the state, Mendez said. The company has about 60 such caf\u00e9s nationwide, including three in Chicago, according to its website, though the Chicago locations are not in low-income areas.\n\nNavarrete said the company is looking to open another caf\u00e9 elsewhere in Chicago and in other low- and middle-income communities across the country.\n\nCritics question plan implementation\n\nCritics and insiders of Capital One\u2019s community benefits plan have expressed skepticism about whether the company is truly committed to execution of the plan.\n\nCommunity benefits agreements like Capital One\u2019s plan play a role in getting regulatory approval for mergers and acquisitions, said Terri Friedline, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan. (Friedline previously served as an expert witness in an unrelated lawsuit against Capital One, which was later dropped.)\n\nBesides persuading regulators to approve bank mergers, elements of these community benefits plans could generate profits for the bank, Friedline said.\n\n\u201cLending to economically disadvantaged and/or Black and brown communities \u2014 that should already be what banks and other finance companies are doing,\u201d Friedline said. \u201cBut having it in the form of a community benefits agreement means that it sounds like they\u2019re doing something extra, or something that is generous on their part. But it's still an activity that traces back to their own bottom line.\u201d\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 doesn\u2019t mandate that banks implement community benefits agreements, but the pacts serve as a way for communities to hold banks accountable for what they\u2019re required to do under the CRA, she explained.\n\nPast community investment plans include a 2018 Nashville plan for jobs, community services and affordable housing; a $1 billion Denver affordable housing plan in 2005; and a $2.8 billion Atlanta project in 2006, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nSuch plans help bolster the banks\u2019 reputations among their employees and the communities they serve, said Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, clinical professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University who is also a former Baxter International CEO and chairman.\n\n\u201cThe larger you are, the more you\u2019re going to have to do to make an impact in terms of people thinking you\u2019re doing something worthwhile,\u201d Kraemer said.\n\nSome critics have said the company\u2019s $265 billion figure is misleading. An analysis of Capital One\u2019s plan by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition asserts that it amounts to $5 billion in new lending, investment and grant activity. The group is a collection of organizations that seek to address racial and socio-economic inequities, particularly with respect to financial well-being.\n\nIn reality, the community benefits plan reflects what both Discover and Capital One were doing prior to the merger, but the $265 billion figure is \u201cmeant to make it look really fancy,\u201d said NCRC Senior Policy Advisor Kevin Hill.\n\nNavarrete said the NCRC\u2019s claim that the $265 billion community benefits plan is not much more than what each company had done before was factually incorrect. Capital One is \u201cthe largest provider of bank uncertified accounts in the country, and we\u2019re increasing our role in that space significantly,\u201d Navarrete said. \u201cWhether you look at this quantitatively or qualitatively, this goes well beyond any [community benefits plan] previously negotiated by any organization.\u201d\n\nWho monitors Capital One\u2019s progress?\n\nNCRC\u2019s Hill raised questions about whether Capital One will uphold its commitments. \u201cThey probably expect the regulators to not pay attention to it past the merger approval if they do walk away,\u201d Hill said.\n\nAn OCC spokesperson said the agency doesn\u2019t monitor compliance with community benefits agreements, nor does it enforce these agreements. The Federal Reserve declined to comment when asked whether it verifies that such agreements are executed.\n\nTo update the public on its progress, Capital One will release an interim report at the end of this year, followed by additional reports in June of the fiscal year after that, Navarrete said.\n\nCapital One\u2019s commitment to financial inclusion is central to its identity, as is providing access to credit for a spectrum of American consumers, the company spokesperson said.",

Partnering organizations have not fleshed out how the plan will be implemented, leading to frustration. This comes as federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and FDIC, rescinded a 2023 plan to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which would have increased regulatory requirements for banks. Critics argue the $265 billion figure is inflated and question the bank's commitment in a changing political environment.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe lack of specific implementation details for Capital One's $265 billion plan, central to its Discover acquisition, raises concerns about its commitment and impact.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed rescinding the 2009 \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d which concluded that emissions of six greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. Previous presidential administrations used the finding to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe EPA said in a press release that if the proposal is finalized, it \u201cis expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through \u201cthe repeal of all greenhouse gas standards.\u201d\n\nRescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants would likely give states more leeway in regulating them, said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that in some states we\u2019ll see the state meeting the moment and regulating power plants more robustly. But in some states, we will not. There\u2019s the potential to have a real patchwork of how power plants are regulated.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn 2007, the Supreme Court ruled the EPA must regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act if it determined the emissions endanger public health and welfare. In 2009, the EPA made that determination for the combination of six greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride \u2014 noting that \u201cthe body of scientific evidence compellingly supports this finding.\u201d It used the finding and the Supreme Court ruling to justify greenhouse gas regulation.\n\nBy rescinding this finding, \u201cEPA thinks it has discovered this one neat trick to eliminate all climate regulations,\u201d Meredith Hankins, senior attorney, climate and energy, for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nYesterday\u2019s announcement kicks off a formal rulemaking process with a 45-day period when cities and other stakeholders will be able to comment before the EPA finalizes and publishes the proposed rule, Turner said. \u201cThen there is the opportunity for stakeholders to challenge the rule in court, as is certain to happen in this instance.\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s press release said rescinding the finding will \u201cgive power back to the states to make their own decisions\u201d about greenhouse gas regulations. Some states delegate some of that authority to local governments, Turner said.\n\nThe administration has signaled a desire to block state and local regulation of power plant emissions as well, however. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify all state and local laws and regulations \u201cburdening the identification, development, siting, production, or use of domestic energy resources that are or may be unconstitutional, preempted by Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable\u201d and submit a report within 60 days.\n\nThat report, if it exists, has not been made public, Turner said. But it indicates \u201can appetite from the federal government to go after local governments for climate policies.\u201d\n\nTurner advised city attorneys to take an inventory of their jurisdictions\u2019 climate-related policies and assess the challenges that could be made against them. She said she\u2019s hesitant to advise cities to put a lot of resources into that yet, however, because \u201cso many other things are happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much coming at them, and I think all of this is part and parcel of a bigger story between the administration and cities,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate Mayors\u2019 leadership said in a joint statement Tuesday that the regulations created in response to the endangerment finding \u201chave resulted in better air quality in communities across the country and are central to America\u2019s ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d Those leaders, which include Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego; Boise, Idaho, Mayor Lauren McLean; and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, vowed that \u201cmayors will not back down from our mission to safeguard our residents\u2019 health and build better, safer, and more affordable cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCities have made tremendous progress advancing climate solutions that are both for our planet and our economies,\u201d U.S. Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran said in a statement. \u201cWe do not have to choose one or the other, but we simply cannot retreat. American mayors urge the Administration to reverse this decision and will continue to fight for federal policy that approaches climate change with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** EPA moves to undo key climate finding, aiming for $54B annual savings.\n\n**Key details:**\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday proposed rescinding its 2009 \"endangerment finding.\" This finding previously concluded that six greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. The EPA stated this proposal is \"expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually\" by repealing all greenhouse gas standards. While this could give states more leeway in regulation, the administration has also signaled a desire to block state and local climate policies.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis proposal challenges the current regulatory framework by seeking to eliminate federal authority over greenhouse gas emissions, citing significant annual cost savings. If finalized, it could create a \"patchwork\" of state-level regulations, leading to inconsistent environmental standards across the country. The move also suggests potential federal preemption efforts against state and local climate policies, which could undermine existing environmental initiatives and impact investment in climate solutions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe 2009 endangerment finding was made after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling mandated EPA regulation of greenhouse gases if they were found to endanger public health. Previous presidential administrations used this finding to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Opponents, including climate and energy groups and city mayors, argue that existing regulations have resulted in better air quality and are central to preventing climate change impacts. The current administration's broader strategy has included identifying state and local laws that \"burden\" domestic energy resources.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$54 billion:** Annual cost savings expected by the EPA from repealing greenhouse gas standards.\n*   **2009:** Year the EPA made the original \"endangerment finding.\"\n*   **2007:** Year the Supreme Court ruled the EPA must regulate greenhouse gas emissions if they endanger public health.\n*   **45 days:** Comment period for cities and stakeholders on the proposed rule.\n*   **6:** Number of greenhouse gases cited in the 2009 endangerment finding.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Proposed rescinding its 2009 \"endangerment finding\" to save $54 billion annually.\n*   **Amy Turner:** Columbia Law School expert who discussed states' potential leeway and federal preemption efforts.\n*   **Supreme Court:** Ruled in 2007 that the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases if they endanger public health.\n*   **Meredith Hankins:** Natural Resources Defense Council senior attorney who criticized the EPA's proposal as a \"neat trick.\"\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed an executive order in April directing a report on state/local laws burdening energy resources.\n*   **Pam Bondi:** Attorney General directed by President Trump to identify state and local laws for a report.\n*   **Climate Mayors:** Leadership group that stated current regulations improved air quality and vowed to continue fighting.\n*   **Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego:** Climate Mayors leader who vowed to safeguard residents' health and build better cities.\n*   **Boise, Idaho, Mayor Lauren McLean:** Climate Mayors leader who vowed to safeguard residents' health and build better cities.\n*   **Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens:** Climate Mayors leader who vowed to safeguard residents' health and build better cities.\n*   **U.S. Conference of Mayors:** Group whose CEO urged the administration to reverse its decision and fight for federal policy.\n*   **Tom Cochran:** CEO and Executive Director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who spoke against the EPA's decision.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   A formal rulemaking process has begun, including a 45-day public comment period for cities and stakeholders.\n*   Stakeholders are certain to challenge the final rule in court after it is published.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe EPA aims to cut costs and shift power on climate regulation.",

        "summary_text": "A transformative shift is underway in American healthcare.\n\nHealthcare systems and human service programs have traditionally operated on a reactive model: treating health issues only after they become (expensive) crises. In recent years, entities across all verticals of the health industry are shifting toward a proactive, data-driven care model.\n\nWhen done well, the strategy significantly reduces healthcare spending and duplication of effort by identifying and addressing non-medical and economic needs that influence health long before they escalate, enabling upstream interventions that save lives and dollars.\n\nBuilding the robust technology backbone for this new type of digital ecosystem\u2014one with secure communication and coordinated analytics\u2014was historically a challenge. Today, these powerful tools have become widely accessible, empowering entities of all sizes, from county governments to individual health providers.\n\nIn fact, in the hands of more local entities, this forward-thinking approach does more than make healthcare delivery more efficient. It fosters collaboration with local health and human service partners and community-based organizations (CBOs), creating many more unique and tailored avenues for data-driven interventions.\n\nThis keeps everyone on the same page, eliminating silos, duplication, and most importantly, focuses on the outcome. In addition to healthcare savings, this can generate savings within other programs dedicated to human wellbeing, all while improving individuals\u2019 economic stability.\n\nThe results of this model are not just theoretical.\n\nSummit County, Ohio: Summit County\u2019s NEXT Program enhanced operational efficiency and produced major savings. The local government saved an estimated $3 million in its first year by increasing financial security among participants, reducing their reliance on public benefits. At the same time, 88% of end users reported that program capacity grew and more than two-thirds reported improved community collaboration. It also improved other services. The local government freed up 591 administrative hours annually, and local non-governmental community organizations received $190,000 for their services.\n\nSouthwest, Virginia: In a study done in collaboration with the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, Ballad Health reported an estimated $825,000 in annualized cost savings per 1,000 patients based on reduced emergency department utilization alone. Fifty-nine percent of participants in this program were insured by Medicaid.\n\nUpstate New York: The Healthy Eating Pilot Program showed a possible savings of up to 13% in total healthcare costs. This pilot connected those with Type 2 Diabetes to medically appropriate food assistance. Fifty percent of participants lowered their A1C levels and had one more \u201chealthy day\u201d a month, making them able to do more.\n\nThe Blueprint for Proactive, Affordable Care\n\nWhen assessing ways to generate outcomes like those above for your constituency, there are three key areas to design for:\n\nLeverage Data for Early Intervention: By integrating data from health and community care services, your agencies can proactively identify individuals at high risk for negative health outcomes. This enables timely support that prevents costly emergency care, reduces long-term healthcare expenditures, and maintains stability for the individual so they can be self-sustaining.\n\nImplement Proactive Care Management: To significantly reduce health outcomes, especially post-discharge, it is critical to ensure that patients are connected to essential community-based services, such as access to nutritious food and behavioral health. Program after program proves simply providing an individual with a list of services doesn\u2019t work\u2014supporting their connection to the services pays for itself many times over.\n\nOptimize Resource Allocation: By creating a clear, comprehensive view of population needs, you can more accurately forecast demand for services. This ensures taxpayer dollars and public resources are directed where they will have the greatest impact. This same mechanism also allows for straightforward assessments of what is working and what isn\u2019t.\n\nUltimately, this shift toward proactive care is not just about fiscal responsibility; it's about delivering better, more personalized services. While the concept is now gaining national attention, it has been a reality for Unite Us for over a decade.\n\nUnite Us was founded in 2013 by two military veterans, Dan Brillman and Taylor Justice, who saw firsthand how their peers struggled to navigate a fragmented landscape of resources. They set out to build a technology platform that could create a \"no wrong door\" approach, first for veterans and now for everyone.\n\nReady to shift from reactive to proactive?

One contract covers urban workers, while the other applies to rural and suburban mail carriers.

All products must be prepped and labeled prior to sending them to Amazon facilities, the company said.\n\nAmazon will still offer the services for shipments created prior to Jan. 1, but shipments created after without the proper prep and labeling won't be eligible for reimbursement if damaged or deemed untraceable.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon said it initially introduced prep services, which include labeling, bubble-wrapping, stickering and bagging items, to help protect products and avoid damage during the shipping process. Over time, sellers' packaging capabilities have improved, reducing the need for Amazon's prep offerings, according to the company.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Amazon sellers now handle their own packaging, including prep and item labeling, either on their own, through their own manufacturing partners or through third-party service providers which allows FBA to focus on providing faster and more efficient fulfillment center operations,\u201d Amazon said.\n\nFor sellers that need to transition to other prep and item labeling services, Amazon suggested two options. One is for sellers to do it themselves, using the company's guidance to prepare products for Fulfillment by Amazon. The other option is to use a third-party service provider.\n\nAmazon also said sellers can tap into the company's Ships in Product Packaging program for eligible products, which can lower prep needs.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most significant operational shifts Amazon has made in recent years,\u201d said Charles Williams, senior manager of marketplace operations at omnichannel agency Blue Wheel, in a LinkedIn post. \u201cGetting ahead of it now will be key to maintaining smooth replenishment and avoiding compliance issues next year.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the next steps for impacted sellers include auditing catalogs for SKUs that rely on Amazon for prep or labeling, updating packaging workflows and adjusting FBA shipment processes ahead of time to avoid disruptions.",

All products must be prepped and labeled prior to being sent to Amazon facilities. Shipments created after this date without proper preparation will not be eligible for reimbursement if damaged or untraceable.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis change represents one of Amazon's \"most significant operational shifts in recent years,\" according to an industry expert. It shifts the entire burden of product preparation and labeling onto sellers, potentially impacting their operational costs and logistics. The move challenges the previous operational model where Amazon provided these services, now allowing FBA to focus on providing faster and more efficient fulfillment center operations.\n\n**The big picture:**\nAmazon initially introduced prep services to help protect products and avoid damage during shipping. However, the company states that sellers' packaging capabilities have improved over time, diminishing the necessity for Amazon's direct offerings.

This decision followed a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum. The extension applies to goods adhering to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). However, imports of cars, steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico will still face U.S. sectoral duties. This action prevents the 30% tariff previously slated to start Friday for Mexican imports.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe extended moratorium avoids an immediate 30% tariff on certain Mexican imports that was set to begin Friday. This provides a crucial 90-day period for the U.S. and Mexico to negotiate and build a long-term trade agreement. It suggests a willingness for diplomatic resolution and trade dialogue with Mexico, contrasting with the immediate tariff impositions on other nations. For investors, this reduces immediate trade uncertainty and potential disruptions to supply chains connected to Mexico. This approach challenges a potential consensus that the administration would apply tariffs broadly and immediately upon their general resumption.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Trump administration plans to resume country-specific duties starting Friday after a monthslong pause.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday imposing a 40% tariff on select imports from Brazil starting Aug. 6, raising the total duty on goods from Brazil to 50%. The order cited a national emergency due to Brazil's government policies as the rationale for the levies.\n\nThe directive stated that the U.S. would match any retaliatory tariffs from Brazil and add them to the 40% duty.

In the order, he claimed that Brazil's policies threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy and economy, asserting that actions by Brazil\u2019s government infringe on the rights of U.S. citizens and U.S. national interests.\n\nTrump's grievances include the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he called \"unjustly charged\" in a politically motivated trial. Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly masterminding a plot to regain power after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.\n\nTrump also accused Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes of contributing to the national emergency by imposing fines on U.S. companies and threatening prosecution for non-compliance.\n\nThe court has held U.S. social media companies, including X, formerly Twitter; Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram; and Google, liable for content on their platforms.\n\nTrump suggested that he could modify the order if Brazil takes significant steps to address the declared national emergency to align with U.S. interests in security and policy.\n\nOn July 15, the U.S. initiated a Section 301 investigation into Brazil's trade practices.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPresident Donald Trump has employed several powers of the executive branch to enact a wide range of tariffs, including country-specific levies scheduled to return Aug. 1. However, Trump's future use of tariffs as a negotiating tool is likely to be determined in the courts, where several states and businesses plan to argue that he lacks the statutory authority to impose sweeping tariffs on all countries that trade with the U.S.\n\nOne of the critical proceedings challenging Trump's tariff use began Thursday. The administration is facing off against lawyers from five companies and 12 states before 11 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The court will decide whether to lift its stay of a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that blocked Trump's broad use of duties, including a global 10% baseline tariff and various other country-specific levies, without congressional approval.\n\nThe case, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v Trump, is one of several lawsuits with plaintiffs fighting tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Here\u2019s a look at five such cases and where they currently stand:\n\nOn April 14, V.O.S. Selections and four other import companies sued the Trump administration in the USCIT, claiming the president exceeded his statutory authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by imposing tariffs without congressional authorization.\n\nThe plaintiffs also claimed that the tariffs hurt them financially by increasing costs and disrupting their operations.\n\nOn April 23, 12 states filed a parallel lawsuit, mainly making the same arguments. So, the USCIT consolidated the two cases, and a three-judge panel ruled on May 28 that the president had no authority to impose across-the-board tariffs under the IEEPA. As a result of the findings, the USCIT issued a permanent injunction against future tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which issued a temporary stay on the injunction while considering the appeal. Oral arguments for the case are scheduled to begin Thursday.\n\nThe hearing is unusual because all 11 judges will hear arguments en banc, instead of via a more typical three-judge panel. An en banc hearing is reserved for cases of exceptional importance and indicates the judges want a ruling reflecting the view of the entire court.\n\nOn April 22, Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind Inc., two small businesses specializing in educational products, filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump's tariffs under the IEEPA.\n\nA judge from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction on May 29, preventing the Trump administration from collecting IEEPA tariffs from the two plaintiffs. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (CADC) granted the administration's request for a stay until it could rule on the case's merits.\n\nOn April 16, California sued Trump in the U.S. District Court of Northern California, challenging the president's authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA. The suit alleges the tariffs exceed Trump's presidential authority and have caused significant harm to California's economy, businesses and consumers.\n\nA District Court judge in June dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the suit belonged in the USCIT. California then sought appellate review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A decision is pending.\n\nOn April 11, Montana State Senator Susan Webber and rancher Jonathan St. Goddard, both citizens of the Blackfeet Nation, sued the U.S. and the U.S. Homeland Security Department, challenging executive orders and proclamations that imposed new tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from Canada. The plaintiffs filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the tariff orders, claiming they exceeded presidential and statutory authority under the IEEPA and Trade Expansion Act. The suit also claimed no clear foreign threat justified the sweeping tariffs, as the Trump administration claimed.\n\nThe case also says that Trump's actions breach two treaties signed by the U.S. government: the 1794 Jay Treaty and the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, which exempted indigenous trade from duties, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe district court granted the government's request to transfer the case to the USCIT on April 25, ruling the suit belonged in the specialized court. The plaintiffs appealed the transfer order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied the request.\n\nOn May 16, Axle of Dearborn, which does business as Detroit Axle, filed a lawsuit in the USCIT against the Commerce Department and three other federal agencies, challenging the legality of several executive orders eliminating the de minimis exemption.\n\nThe Michigan-based automotive parts distributor argues that the president lacks the statutory and constitutional authority to revoke the exemption, which allows duty-free importation of goods valued at less than $800. The company called on the court to block multiple executive orders implementing tariffs and banning the exemption.\n\nThe government argues that the president has the power under the IEEPA and the U.S. Constitution to take \"emergency\" actions, including withdrawing the de minimis exemption as part of a response to international trade threats.\n\nThe Trump administration requested a halt to the proceedings until the V.O.S. Selections case is resolved. On July 28, the USCIT granted the stay.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMerck & Co. is looking to make a comeback in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nEli Lilly, Biogen and Eisai have outpaced the Big Pharma field in bringing new drugs to market, but now Merck is betting on the next wave of Alzheimer\u2019s treatments by homing in on biomarkers and other precision medicine techniques for patients in earlier stages.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s drug landscape keeps evolving, and companies like Merck have had to change their approach along with it. So while anti-amyloid drugs like Biogen and Eisai\u2019s Leqembi and Lilly\u2019s Kisunla showcase solid yet incremental improvement, a new slate of candidates could make up the next stage of disease prevention and treatment.\n\nMerck has moved two of those drug candidates to phase 2 trials, including a tau-targeting antibody called MK-2214 and a neurotransmitter modulator called MK-1167. And although many of the complexities surrounding Alzheimer\u2019s persist, Merck is doubling down on recent advances to more effectively target the core pathologies of the disease.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field,\u201d said Dr. Mike Egan, vice president of neuroscience global clinical development at Merck. \u201cWhat drugs are we going after, and what is the appropriate disease stage in terms of selecting drug targets? That\u2019s been greatly informed by advances in genetics and our understanding of what might be an opportune target to hit, as well as advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.\u201d\n\nAmid lower sales forecasts, Merck this week said it will begin a cost-saving plan involving layoffs and focus on newer drug launches to overcome the looming patent loss for cancer blockbuster Keytruda in the next couple years. A renewed emphasis on neuroscience appears to be part of that forward-looking strategy.\n\nThese two candidates will carry what Merck neuroscience leaders hope is a resurgence in the pharma\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s prowess into a new era, catching up to rivals and bringing effective treatments to the challenging arena.\n\nLearning from history\n\nThe current roster of Alzheimer\u2019s drug hopefuls isn\u2019t Merck\u2019s first stroll around the block. Along with many drugmakers still targeting the memory-stealing disease, the company walks a path littered with failures.\n\nBack before the first anti-amyloid approvals of the early 2020s, Merck and fellow pharma giants were all aiming at a different target altogether: the BACE inhibitor. One by one, though, as Merck ended its BACE inhibitor program in 2018 due to poor efficacy, so did the other drugmakers, including bigwigs like Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Novartis and Eisai.\n\nThis time around, Merck\u2019s understanding of the disease\u2019s targets has improved to the point that the company is better prepared to bring the drugs through trials, said Jonathan Sugam, principal scientist of neuroscience discovery at Merck.\n\n\u201cAdvances in the field over the past decade or so have taken us toward what we think are the most appropriate targets based on both genetically validated targets in the appropriate disease population, as well as targets we think are most viable based on what we\u2019ve learned about the biomarkers that describe the pathophysiology of the disease, tau being one of the big ones,\u201d Sugam said.\n\n\u201cOur approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease has changed substantially over the years, and that\u2019s driven largely by changes in the field.\" Dr. Mike Egan VP, neuroscience, global clinical development, Merck & Co.\n\nAlong with many of the companies licking their BACE inhibitor wounds from almost 10 years ago, Merck learned some important lessons about the approach to Alzheimer\u2019s. From trial design to viable endpoints to the balance of speed and precision, Egan said that \u201cit\u2019s important to continue to invest in Alzheimer\u2019s disease to get clear, strong biomarker evidence of target engagement and disease biology before going to big phase 3 trials.\u201d\n\nThat perspective is critical as the company moves ahead with these two candidates, and Sugam said Merck is better prepared this time. Alzheimer\u2019s trials are notoriously difficult to recruit and enroll because of the complexity of the disease, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better equipped now than we were previously to identify the right patient at the right time for the right therapy,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cUsing biomarkers to identify and track patients appropriately in a trial \u2026 is one of the biggest innovations in the field.\u201d\n\nTau and PAM\n\nMK-2214 is designed to clear tau tangles in the brain, which, along with amyloid plaques, are considered one of the hallmarks of the disease. But unlike some other drugs that clear tau, the antibody takes aim not just at the protein itself but also its mechanism of spreading to different regions of the brain, making it a potential prevention in pre-symptomatic patients.\n\nThat process begins with the specific target pS413, which is a type of extracellular tau associated with accumulation of the protein in the brain. By tracking these tau \u201cseeds\u201d as they spread, Merck researchers have found that an antibody can more effectively root out drivers of the disease than a more general tau inhibitor.\n\n\u201cWe can actually see the progression of this tau over time in different brain regions and stage the disease appropriately,\u201d Sugam said. \u201cWe believe, along with others, that this pathological spreading of tau is a key driver of some of the disease process and some of the symptomology of the disease \u2014 being able to target that with an antibody like MK-2214 is something we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\n\nAnd by targeting the \u201cseeds\u201d of corruption in the brain, MK-2214 could potentially be used earlier in patients who show tau accumulation without the telltale symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s such as cognitive decline, Egan said. That also determines the window in which patients will be included in clinical trials.\n\n\u201cA key question is, when does the seeding occur? It probably occurs early,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe have to take a Goldilocks approach, similar to how Lilly conducted [Kisunla] trials in people with moderate amounts of tau, as opposed to too much or not enough \u2014 people who haven\u2019t had tau seeded to all their cortical neurons.\u201d\n\nOn top of MK-2214, Merck is also in mid-stage trials for a drug candidate that takes a wholly different approach. MK-1167 is an alpha-7 positive allosteric modulator, known as PAM, that targets and turns on a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. By bringing acetylcholine back online, MK-1167 could improve cognitive function in patients already experiencing symptoms.\n\nLeaning into the company\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s resurgence, Egan said there\u2019s room for more molecules in the pipeline \u2014 and Merck is willing to open the purse strings for the right prospect, employing M&A or partnerships to bolster the portfolio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to say to the world that if you have good Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, feel free to touch base with us, because we have both an internal pipeline and an external pipeline \u2014 nobody has a monopoly on good ideas,\u201d Egan said. \u201cWe want to pursue new medications that could help patients, whether it\u2019s for disease modification or cognition or symptomatic approaches.\u201d",

He added that the sum will be revealed in the next two weeks when South Korea President Lee Jae Myung comes to the White House for a bilateral meeting.\n\nThe U.S. imported about $132 billion worth of goods from South Korea in 2024.

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump announces \"Full and Complete\" US-South Korea trade deal\n\n**Key details:** President Trump announced a \u201cFull and Complete Trade Deal\u201d with South Korea, stating the U.S. would implement a 15% tariff on South Korean imports, while U.S. goods entering South Korea would face no tariffs. Under the proposed deal, South Korea committed to being \u201ccompletely OPEN TO TRADE\u201d for American products including cars, trucks, and agriculture. Furthermore, South Korea would provide $350 million in investments to the U.S. and purchase $100 billion in energy products. An additional \"large sum of money\" investment from South Korea is also part of the deal, with the amount to be revealed soon.\n\n**Why it matters:** This newly announced trade deal significantly alters previous stated intentions, where South Korean imports were set to face a 25% tariff starting August 1. Instead, the proposed 15% U.S. tariff on South Korean goods is lower, and U.S. exports to South Korea would face no tariffs, challenging the prior expectation of reciprocal tariffs. This agreement could open new market access for U.S. industries like automotive and agriculture in South Korea. The substantial investments and energy product purchases by South Korea also represent a notable financial inflow for the U.S.\n\n**The big picture:** This deal follows an earlier statement from President Trump indicating a 25% tariff on South Korean imports starting August 1, as part of a return to country-specific reciprocal tariffs. South Korea is a significant U.S. trading partner, accounting for 3.7% of U.S. trade. In 2024, the U.S. imported approximately $132 billion from South Korea, while exporting $66 billion to the country last year. This agreement with South Korea is part of a broader trend, as Trump has also reached trade agreements with several other partners recently, including the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   15%: Proposed U.S. tariff on imports from South Korea.\n*   $350 million: South Korean investments planned for the U.S.\n*   $100 billion: Value of energy products South Korea will buy.\n*   $132 billion: U.S. imports from South Korea in 2024.\n*   3.7%: South Korea's share of U.S. trade.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Announced the \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" with South Korea on Truth Social.\n*   **South Korea:** The country that has reportedly struck a new comprehensive trade deal with the United States.\n*   **President Lee Jae Myung:** South Korea's President, scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House soon.\n*   **European Union:** Recently reached some level of agreement regarding tariffs and trade policies with the U.S.\n*   **Japan:** One of several U.S. trading partners with whom Trump recently reached trade agreements.\n*   **Indonesia:** Another U.S. trading partner recently involved in a trade agreement with President Trump.\n*   **Philippines:** A U.S. trading partner with whom Trump recently reached some level of trade agreement.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   South Korea President Lee Jae Myung's bilateral meeting at the White House in the next two weeks.\n*   Revelation of the undisclosed \"large sum of money\" investment from South Korea within the next two weeks.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New US-South Korea trade deal signals significant shifts from prior tariff plans.",

At the time, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary called his hiring a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d for CBER, as Prasad brought the \u201cscientific rigor, independence and transparency\u201d the office needed, he claimed.\n\nMakary later named Prasad as the FDA\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer, in addition to his role at CBER.\n\nPrasad was a vocal opponent of his predecessor Dr. Peter Marks, who ran CBER for nearly a decade before resigning in March after a dispute with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Marks championed regulatory flexibility while at the FDA and, as head of CBER, oversaw the review and approvals of COVID-19 vaccines as well as dozens of cell and gene therapies. Prasad previously criticized many of those decisions and, notably, had castigated Marks for overruling FDA reviewers in clearing Sarepta Therapeutics\u2019 Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy Elevidys.\n\nPrasad\u2019s appointment had raised questions among many biotech companies and investors that FDA standards might be shifting. After joining the FDA, Prasad quickly worked with Makary to establish stricter approval guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines. He also three times stepped in to overrule other agency reviewers in issuing narrower-than-requested clearances for COVID shots developed by Moderna and Novavax.\n\nAt a round table meeting hosted by the FDA in early June, Prasad attempted to ease concerns CBER might be less flexible under his watch in regulating gene therapies for rare conditions.\n\n\u201cWe understand that progress is not always made in a single leap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will consider incremental steps forward, because those add up.\u201d\n\nA month later, the FDA rejected a Duchenne cell therapy from Capricor Therapeutics that Prasad reportedly scrutinized. Shortly afterwards, the FDA engaged in an unusual public standoff with Sarepta over its Duchenne gene therapy Elevidys. Following the deaths of two Elevidys recipients \u2014 as well as the death of a study volunteer who received a different gene therapy \u2014 the agency asked Sarepta to halt all shipments of its treatment. After initially defying the request, Sarepta agreed, and published reports suggested the company might need new safety data before the FDA would allow Elevidys back on the market.\n\nBut in the ensuing days, Prasad was targeted by right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, other conservative commentators and in op-eds published in The Wall Street Journal. One Journal op-ed criticized him as being a \u201cBernie Sanders acolyte in MAHA drag\u201d and a \u201cone-man death panel.\u201d Another argued his decisionmaking suggested he believes \u201cpeople can\u2019t be trusted to make their own decisions about risks and benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen the FDA suddenly allowed Sarepta to resume some shipments of Elevidys on Monday, some Wall Street analysts speculated higher-ups within the Trump administration had stepped in.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a resignation in the short term,\u201d Baird analyst Brian Skorney wrote in a note to investors on Monday.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIf Novo Nordisk aimed to boost confidence in the company\u2019s future course by naming a new CEO, those hopes were dashed this week.\n\nThe weight loss and diabetes juggernaut announced that Maziar Mike Doustdar \u2014 a long-time company executive \u2014 is taking the reins on Tuesday, calling him the \u201cbest person\u201d to lead Novo into its \u201cnext growth phase.\u201d\n\nNovo shares plunged over 20% after the news came out \u2014 its largest single-day drop ever recorded.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s much more to Novo\u2019s story than the CEO news, which comes as the industry grapples with a range of market challenges, including widespread regulatory changes, potential tariffs, patent cliffs and more. In fact, Novo is one of several large pharmas to shake up their top brass this month.\n\nHere\u2019s more on Novo\u2019s major leadership transition and other companies attempting to right the ship with a fresh face behind the wheel.\n\nNovo\u2019s descent back to earth\n\nAfter its weight-loss-fueled ascent to the sales stratosphere, Novo is working to try to keep its growth sky high.\n\nIn May, the Danish pharma said CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen would step down, following a turn in the obesity market. While Novo was the star of the emerging weight loss and diabetes market through its GLP-1s Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly took over the majority of the market officially earlier this year thanks to growing popularity for Zepbound and Wegovy. The switchup brought Novo back to the drawing board for a rebound.\n\nThis week, while naming its new CEO, the company also cut its guidance for 2025 from a sales increase of 13% to 21% to between 8% and 14% after slower-than-expected uptake of its GLP-1 products. Doustdar is now tasked with the challenge of navigating Novo\u2019s new era as the second-place obesity leader, grappling with slower growth, potential incoming competitors and compounded versions of its drugs still available on the cheap for some patients.\n\nDoustdar has been with Novo for more than 30 years, most recently serving as executive vice president of international operations after getting his start as an office clerk in Vienna during the 1990s. He oversaw the launch of Novo\u2019s GLP-1s in several countries, and could tighten up the ship with workforce cuts once at the helm in August, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI come to this role with a sense of urgency, a laser focus on high performance, and a fierce determination for Novo Nordisk to aim higher than it\u2019s ever done,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAmid the changes at the top, Novo also restructured its R&D, combining two divisions into one, which will be led by the company\u2019s newly appointed chief scientist, Dr. Martin Holst Lange.\n\nKenvue\u2019s shaky future\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s decision to spin off its consumer health business in 2023 followed a wave of similar moves by major pharma companies such as Sanofi and GSK. The goal was to streamline, simplify and refocus on the business of innovating drugs.\n\nBut since going it alone, J&J\u2019s spinoff Kenvue has struggled to find its footing as a mammoth, multi-faceted company with a broad OTC drug portfolio including stalwarts such as Tylenol and Benadryl, along with household favorite brands like Aveeno and Listerine.\n\nSeveral headwinds \u2014 including falling sales at retail pharmacies \u2014 have triggered pressure from activist investors to make a change. Starboard Value already has a seat on the company\u2019s board, and earlier this year Third Point and Toms Capital bought up more of its stock.\n\nWith Kenvue in the midst of a strategic review, CEO Thibaut Mongon was ousted suddenly this month and replaced by interim head Kirk Perry, the company\u2019s board director. While the company touted Perry\u2019s 30 years of leadership in consumer packaged goods, it said an executive search firm has been hired to lead the quest for its next permanent CEO.\n\nIn its preliminary earnings report for the most recent quarter, Kenvue said it expects a 4% sales drop.\n\nNews of the shift has fueled investor speculation that Kenvue is preparing to sell some of its brands or setting the stage for an outright acquisition of the company, which is currently valued at $40 billion.\n\nJazz sings new tune with CEO switch\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals made history by scoring the first FDA approval for a CBD-based drug in 2018. Now, Epidiolex, which is indicated for two rare forms of epilepsy, is on its way to crossing the blockbuster threshold this year, providing an ample revenue cushion for the company\u2019s ongoing pursuit of M&A.\n\nBut Jazz\u2019s next big act could be in oncology. The Ireland-based biopharma picked up Chimerix this year for $935 million to nab a brain tumor candidate, potentially building on a portfolio that also includes a HER2-targeting bispecific antibody that\u2019s already won an accelerated approval in one cancer indication and is being studied in several more. Citeline has pegged the treatment, Ziihera, as a potential blockbuster.\n\nWith its future coming into sharper focus, Jazz announced new leadership plans this month. Ren\u00e9e Gal\u00e1 will step into the CEO role in August as former CEO Bruce Cozadd retires. Gal\u00e1, who became the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer in 2023 and brings over 30 years of industry experience to the post, has played a \u201ccritical role in driving Jazz\u2019s ongoing transformation.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nRoche\u2019s efforts to break into the lucrative obesity market haven\u2019t abated. The pharma giant sealed the largest deal in the space earlier this year when it announced a collaboration with Zealand Pharma for more than $5 billion. The agreement built on Roche\u2019s $2.7 billion deal to pick up Carmot Therapeutics and its suite of early- and mid-stage obesity candidates in 2023.\n\nAfter shelling out to get into the race, the Swiss pharma\u2019s strategy to enter the market with differentiated assets is becoming clearer as the drugs move through the clinic.\n\nNow, the Swiss pharma is revealing more about its long-term pipeline plans and potential move to join the ranks of other Big Pharma companies in the direct-to-patient space.\n\nObesity pipeline\n\nRoche\u2019s lead obesity candidate, CT-388, is a weekly injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Currently in phase 2, the drug has already shown promising weight loss results. In a phase 1b trial, patients lost an average of 18.8% over 24 weeks.\n\nThe company plans to announce a phase 3 study in obesity for the drug later this year, according to its most recent earnings presentation. In addition, Roche wants to study CT-388 combined with petrelintide, a mid-stage amylin analog it licensed in its deal with Zealand.\n\n\u201cBoth petrelintide and CT-388 are currently in phase 2 studies, and we will need to review the results of those two monotherapy studies before we can share very specific timelines and details for the phase 2 combination,\u201d said Teresa Graham, Roche\u2019s CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the company\u2019s innovative medicines arm, on an earnings call. \u201cHowever, our expectation is that we will be moving into combo initiation in 2026.\u201d\n\nThe combo therapy plan was part of the original deal with Zealand. The company was previously studying a combination of an early-stage asset CT-173 with CT-388. But Roche revealed that it\u2019s cutting CT-173 from its pipeline in the earnings report.\n\nThe candidate, a long-acting peptide YY analog that had not yet entered human trials, was picked up in the Carmot acquisition. The drug aimed to control appetite by targeting the PYY hormone, and Roche had originally planned to enter phase 1 testing this year before axing it.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to discontinue CT-173 \u2026 based on a comprehensive assessment of its developability, competitive positioning and commercial viability,\u201d Graham said.\n\nRoche is also exploring an oral GLP-1 that could give the company a competitive edge if it enters the obesity market down the line. With one early-stage asset off the books, Roche still has several options in the works.\n\n\"Overall with our obesity portfolio \u2026 we still feel very confident that we have a potentially best in disease and highly competitive portfolio of products,\u201d Graham said on a separate call with media last week.\n\nA DTC play?\n\nRoche may also take a page from Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which all launched DTC platforms for certain medications, including obesity and diabetes drugs.\n\nWhile other pharmas have also created DTC channels, Lilly and Novo\u2019s offerings launched amid an exploding market with insurance coverage challenges. Via the DTC platforms, the meds are available for about half the price in a vial format. Bristol Myers Squibb also recently announced it was working to sell its blood thinner medication Eliquis, which is co-owned with Pfizer, directly to patients.\n\nThe platforms not only offer some patients a cheaper price, they also fall in line with a Trump administration priority to lower drug prices by enabling DTC pharma sales at the \u201cmost-favored nation cost.\u201d The policy, as outlined in a May executive order from President Donald Trump, asks drugmakers to sell medications at the lowest price paid by an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country with a GDP per capita that\u2019s at least 60% of the U.S. measure.\n\nRoche is now considering its own DTC platform that would comply with the Trump administration\u2019s DTC desires. According to executives, the platform would potentially offer its future obesity products.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the BMS, Pfizer-type direct to patient, I think this is absolutely something that we would consider for the right product,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd one might imagine that this could be a really good type of program that you would use with your obesity assets.\u201d\n\nRoche Group CEO Thomas Schinecker added that DTC could also work for some of its other drugs, but he didn\u2019t go into detail about plans to launch its own platform and noted the company is in talks with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThere are other areas as well where we can do that, but these are discussions that we are having with the U.S. government,\u201d he said during the call.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Roche Refines Obesity Strategy, Eyes Direct-to-Patient Sales After Major Investments\n\n**Key details:** Roche is advancing CT-388, a weekly injectable dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, which showed 18.8% weight loss in a phase 1b trial. The company plans to announce a phase 3 study for CT-388 in obesity later this year. Roche also revealed it is cutting CT-173, an early-stage asset, from its obesity pipeline. Furthermore, Roche is considering launching a direct-to-patient (DTC) platform for future obesity products. This potential move aligns with Trump administration priorities to lower drug prices.\n\n**Why it matters:** Roche is clarifying its significant investment strategy in the lucrative obesity market by detailing its lead drug's progress and pipeline adjustments. The decision to cut CT-173 highlights a focused approach on assets with better developability and commercial viability. Roche's consideration of a direct-to-patient platform could challenge existing distribution models and pricing norms for obesity drugs. This move suggests a potential shift towards offering future products at lower prices, addressing market challenges like insurance coverage. It aligns with broader government priorities to reduce drug costs for patients.\n\n**The big picture:** Roche is actively working to enter the lucrative obesity market, having made significant investments including a $5 billion+ collaboration with Zealand Pharma and a $2.7 billion deal for Carmot Therapeutics. The company's strategy involves bringing differentiated assets to this competitive space. Other major pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer have already launched direct-to-patient platforms for their medications. These existing DTC platforms for obesity and diabetes drugs offer meds at about half the price in a vial format. The Trump administration has prioritized lowering drug prices through policies like \"most-favored nation cost\" for DTC pharma sales.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over $5 billion: Roche's collaboration deal with Zealand Pharma.\n*   $2.7 billion: Roche's deal to acquire Carmot Therapeutics in 2023.\n*   18.8%: Average weight loss over 24 weeks for CT-388 in a phase 1b trial.\n*   2026: Expected year for the initiation of a CT-388 and petrelintide combination study.\n*   Half the price: Medications available via DTC platforms are offered for about half the price in a vial format.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Roche:** Swiss pharma giant making significant investments and strategy adjustments in the obesity market.\n*   **Zealand Pharma:** Collaborated with Roche in a deal worth over $5 billion for obesity assets.\n*   **Carmot Therapeutics:** Acquired by Roche in 2023, providing early- and mid-stage obesity candidates.\n*   **Teresa Graham:** CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals, discussed pipeline status and potential direct-to-patient platforms.\n*   **Thomas Schinecker:** Roche Group CEO, commented on the broader applicability of direct-to-patient models.\n*   **Pfizer:** Pharmaceutical company that has launched a direct-to-consumer platform for certain medications.\n*   **Eli Lilly:** Big Pharma company that launched direct-to-consumer offerings for obesity and diabetes drugs.\n*   **Novo Nordisk:** Big Pharma company that launched direct-to-consumer offerings for obesity and diabetes drugs.\n*   **Bristol Myers Squibb:** Announced plans to sell its co-owned blood thinner medication directly to patients.\n*   **Donald Trump:** President whose administration pushed for policies to lower drug prices through direct sales.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Roche plans to announce a phase 3 study for CT-388 in obesity later this year.\n*   Expectation for combo initiation of CT-388 and petrelintide is 2026.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Roche hones obesity strategy, eyes direct sales and pipeline adjustments after major investments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nVenture capital firm Omega Funds closed a $647 million fund this month dedicated to supporting life sciences biotechs, bucking an industry trend that\u2019s seen a swift downturn in investing since the high-on-the-hog landscape of only five years ago.\n\nIn fact, biotech investors closed just four venture capital funds during the first quarter of 2025, according to new data from PitchBook. That\u2019s a huge drop in pace from 2021\u2019s peak of 309 total funds for the year.\n\nBut this downturn actually represents a post-bubble rightsizing of the market that will open up new opportunities not only for investors, but for promising technologies, according to Otello Stampacchia, Omegas\u2019 founder and managing director.\n\n\u201cThis creates a very good background for investing at great prices, in great companies,\u201d Stampacchia said.\n\nOther investors echo that sentiment.\n\nWhen Deerfield Management Company closed its latest healthcare innovations fund of over $600 million in May, the firm\u2019s managing partner, James Flynn, said there\u2019s \u201cnever been a better time to invest in new and evolving technologies and products across the life science, medical technology and healthcare service landscape.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with PharmaVoice, he elaborated on why the time felt right.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through a several-year period where valuations have gone down and competition for new assets has gone down, from an investment standpoint [that\u2019s] a good thing,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen you combine that with what are continual advances and knowledge of biology, continual advances in discovery tools, your ability to take those things forward in a cost effective and direct way improves.\u201d\n\nBiotech\u2019s new era of opportunity\n\nIt was actually harder to invest during the last biotech bubble because of so much \u201cnoise\u201d from competing investors, Stampacchia said.\n\n\u201cThere was so much enthusiasm from, in some cases, non-sophisticated, non-biotech specialist investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was actually a bit counterproductive.\u201d\n\nNot only were valuations \u201ca bit out of whack,\u201d but \u201cdiligence times were shorter, companies were awash in opportunity to get new investors in and discipline also went a bit out of the window,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy.\" Otello Stampacchia Founder, managing director, Omega Funds\n\nThe bubble could only burst after that glut of investing.\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a period of excess in 2019, 2020, where valuations went up very sharply and lots of companies that probably shouldn't have gone public went public,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cWhen the correction occurred, none of them could raise money. They were all burning a huge amount of cash.\u201d\n\nStampacchia echoed this.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way too many public companies to attract investors\u2019 attention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a while, but there\u2019s been a steady reduction in those companies. Some of the great ones have been acquired. Some of the good ones will be acquired. Some of the terrible ones have done reverse mergers or returned cash to shareholders.\u201d\n\nCertainly technologies suffered from overhype, too.\n\n\u201cI think all the CRISPR craze was probably overdone,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cA whole bunch of companies went public. Some of them are continuing to progress, and we're starting to see some drugs out of them, but they became extremely heavily valued and had very high cash-burn with pretty speculative types of targets.\u201d\n\nStampacchia agrees that \u201cin today\u2019s environment, we think some modalities are trickier to justify\u201d and points to cell therapy as an example, thanks to \u201chuge logistic challenges, costs and difficulties to convert a certain type of physicians.\u201d\n\nAlthough Omega successfully invested in some early cell and gene therapy companies, Stampacchia said momentum in that arena has \u201cslowed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the bar is super high for us in that space,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sector\u2019s future\n\nAlthough there\u2019s still a lot of instability in the biotech market due to government funding cuts and policy uncertainty, investors who\u2019ve weathered the storm are being \u201cjudicious\u201d about where they put their money and attention.\n\n\u201cYou need to be disciplined. You need to know what you\u2019re doing. You need to really have a capacity of discerning great individuals and great drugs, which is not a given,\u201d Stampacchia said, noting that since its 2004 founding, Omega Funds has raised $2.5 billion and its portfolio companies launched 52 commercialized products.\n\nNow, with its newest $647 million Fund VIII \u2014 which exceeded its $600 million target \u2014 Omega aims to create and invest in life sciences companies in the U.S. and Europe that target severe, unmet medical needs.\n\nSpecifically, Omega will continue to be active in oncology and immunology, as well as some rare diseases, Stampacchia said. They\u2019re also \u201ccautiously\u201d making investments in the cardiometabolic space by being \u201cthoughtful\u201d about the unmet need.\n\nWhile Deerfield invests more widely across the healthcare space, Flynn said its areas of interest are very \u201cgenetics driven\u201d and include oncology and immunology.\n\nThe other four funds cited in PitchBook\u2019s report were from Ocampo Capital, Foundation Capital, 4BIO Capital and F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth. Although each of these new funds may face challenges, the downturn is likely good for the market in the long run.\n\n\u201cOverall, for the ecosystem \u2026 a cleansing period like this one is healthy,\u201d Stampacchia said.",

        "summary": "**Omega Funds Bucks Biotech VC Trend With New $647M Fund**\n\n**Key details:** Venture capital firm Omega Funds closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs this month, defying a broad industry downturn. Only four biotech venture capital funds closed in Q1 2025, a steep drop from 309 total in 2021. Other investors, including Deerfield Management Company, also recently closed large funds over $600 million. These firms view the current downturn as a \"post-bubble rightsizing\" that creates new investment opportunities at attractive prices.\n\n**Why it matters:** This activity challenges the implied consensus that the biotech investment downturn signifies only risk or lack of opportunity. Investors like Omega and Deerfield believe the market \"cleansing period\" is healthy, reducing \"noise\" from non-specialist investors and overvalued companies. They highlight that lower valuations and reduced competition make it a prime time to invest in promising technologies. This suggests a strategic shift where disciplined capital finds value despite broader market instability.\n\n**The big picture:** The biotech market experienced a \"bubble\" from 2019-2020, characterized by sharp valuation increases and less disciplined investing. Many companies, some of which should not have gone public, struggled with cash burn after the correction. Overhyped technologies, including CRISPR and cell therapy, also saw speculative valuations and high cash burn. The current market downturn is seen as a necessary correction, reducing competition and allowing for more discerning investment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **$647 million:** Size of Omega Funds' new fund (Fund VIII).\n*   **4:** Biotech VC funds closed in Q1 2025.\n*   **309:** Total biotech VC funds closed in 2021 (peak).\n*   **$600 million+:** Size of Deerfield Management Company's latest healthcare innovations fund.\n*   **$2.5 billion:** Total funds raised by Omega Funds since its 2004 founding.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Omega Funds:** Venture capital firm that successfully closed a $647 million fund for life sciences biotechs.\n*   **Otello Stampacchia:** Founder and managing director of Omega Funds, who believes the downturn creates good investment conditions.\n*   **PitchBook:** Data provider referenced for statistics on venture capital fund closures in the biotech sector.\n*   **Deerfield Management Company:** Investment firm that closed a healthcare innovations fund over $600 million.\n*   **James Flynn:** Managing partner of Deerfield Management Company, who sees a great time to invest in new technologies.\n*   **PharmaVoice:** Publication where James Flynn shared his detailed views on the current investment climate.\n*   **Ocampo Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **Foundation Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **4BIO Capital:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n*   **F\u00e5hraeus Startup and Growth:** One of the four funds cited by PitchBook that recently closed a new biotech-focused fund.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Savvy investors see biotech's downturn as a healthy market \"cleansing\" creating opportunities.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhen a bispecific antibody drug beat Keytruda in a Chinese lung cancer trial last year, excitement around the drug category skyrocketed, fueled by the tantalizing prospect of a newcomer unseating the megablockbuster.\n\nIvonescimab, which was developed by China-based Akeso and licensed to Summit Therapeutics, targets both PD-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that promotes blood vessel growth and shields tumors from the immune system. This dual-targeting approach \u2014 a hallmark of bispecific drugs \u2014 blocks immune evasion using PD-1 and cuts off the tumor\u2019s blood supply, which could pack a stronger cancer-fighting punch than either strategy alone.\n\nWhile the encouraging results in the Chinese phase 3 trial raised hopes ivonescimab and other drugs in the bispecific category could disrupt Keytruda\u2019s dominance in the oncology market, more recent data from a global trial of ivonescimab dampened that optimism. In the phase 3 study, the drug missed the key benchmark of overall survival. And even if future trials clear that hurdle, matching Keytruda\u2019s staggering success may still prove elusive, said Ethan Smith, therapy area director at Norstella.\n\n\u201cCan it become a $25 billion to $30 billion drug? I think that\u2019s a bit of a fantasy,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the candidate\u2019s other promising results have highlighted the rising potential of bispecifics to set new standards in cancer care.\n\nA rising drug class\n\nWhile Summit is leading the pack in bispecific antibody oncology contenders, ivonescimab isn\u2019t the only horse in the race. Among many contenders in the Big Pharma ranks vying for bispecific market share, companies like BioNTech, Merck & Co. and Pfizer boast several of the candidates in clinical development \u2014 a smattering compared to the overall space.\n\nBioNTech\u2019s BN327, acquired from Biotheus, differs from ivonescimab by targeting PD-L1 \u2014 instead of PD-1 \u2014 in addition to VEGF. It\u2019s in multiple phase 2 and phase 3 trials for lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, and has shown some favorable data. In June, the company announced it is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to test the drug in solid tumors as well.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging.\" Ethan Smith Therapy area director, Norstella\n\nKeytruda maker Merck is in early-phase testing with LM-299, which it licensed from LaNova Medicines. The company is looking to shore up its pipeline to compensate for an expected drop in Keytruda sales when a key patent expires in 2028 and the door opens to biosimilar competition.\n\nPfizer signed a $1.25 billion deal with 3SBio for SSG-707, another PD-1xVEGF that is poised to start phase 3 trials in China.\n\nSigns of promise and setbacks\n\nIn the meantime, the industry will be closely watching ivonescimab, the fate of which could become a bellwether for other bispecifics in development.\n\nMost recently, the drug demonstrated positive progression-free survival data in topline results from Summit\u2019s phase 3 global clinical trial released in May.\n\nThe results overall, however, were a mixed bag. Despite delaying tumor progression, the drug\u2019s 21% reduction in the risk of death was not considered statistically significant and \u201cdidn't translate to overall survival,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price dropped 20% on the news, contributing to a murky picture of the drug\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI think a physician would say this is clearly beneficial for patients. But it\u2019s not something that the FDA will approve unless the final data does become significant, which I think is an outside bet,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe FDA typically requires statistically significant survival data for full approval. Even so, Summit plans to submit an FDA filing, although the timing isn\u2019t clear.\n\nGoing forward, all eyes will be on ivonescimab\u2019s performance in the two upcoming trials, Smith said. Both studies pit the drug directly against Keytruda, not a placebo as in the original trial.\n\n\u201cThis will help answer the bigger question: Can it replace Keytruda?\u201d Smith said.\n\nFinal results from these trials won\u2019t be released until 2027 or 2028, although there will likely be some earlier signals from interim data. However, two factors make it unlikely that the bispecifics can ultimately best Keytruda outside of the clinic. First, the oncology market has become more segmented and personalized.\n\n\u201cFor any drug to attain the status to capture all of these patients across so many different tumor types \u2026 will be super challenging,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn addition, Summit is a relatively small company and may have difficulty pushing the drug to the dizzying heights experienced by Keytruda. Partnering with another company to gain additional resources could change the outlook, Smith said. And there\u2019s buzz that the company is trying to do just that with AstraZeneca, which has reportedly been in talks with Summit about a deal as high as $15 billion for the bispecific, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut ultimately, even though PD-1 VEGF drugs are likely to earn a place in the oncology market, they probably won\u2019t completely edge out Keytruda at its peak.\n\n\u201cIn indications that make sense, like small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, it can [become] a very strong alternative,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat would be easier to do in the U.S., but will be more challenging in Europe, where you've got cost-effectiveness challenges if you've got a marginal benefit with ivonescimab versus a [Keytruda] biosimilar.\u201d\n\nWhether bispecifics or another up-and-coming technology succeeds in the clinic, it\u2019s unlikely any new drug will achieve the same reach as Keytruda, Smith said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any oncology drug is going to be able to replicate what Keytruda has done,\u201d Smith said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhile the U.S. abruptly backs out of commitments to fund early research at the National Institutes of Health, fruits of prior funding are still contributing to the nation\u2019s leading role in lifting the science that eventually makes its way into biopharma\u2019s innovation machine.\n\nRecent studies showcase the advances being made at lab benches around the world by scientists who depend on grants and awards from the NIH. That research drives not only the advancement of health and well-being, but also the U.S. economy.\n\nHere are some studies from just the last couple of weeks \u2014 all funded in part by the NIH \u2014 that could advance the biopharma industry by enhancing valuable products already on the market from mRNA to obesity.\n\nA new way to mRNA\n\nThe mRNA revolution, many years in the making, revved up a few notches with the quick and unprecedented introduction of vaccines to combat the raging COVID-19 pandemic. Companies like Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna solidified a perch on the biopharma podium for that fleeting moment, raking in billions in profit.\n\nDespite the lofty goals and ongoing development programs since the pandemic, mRNA technology hasn\u2019t become the industry workhorse it once promised to be. From political backlash to clinical stumbles, progress has stalled as the world awaits the next big mRNA push.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are working diligently to improve the original formula that makes mRNA successful at introducing genetic material for an antibody response, whether that\u2019s prophylactic like a vaccine or therapeutic like a cancer treatment. And researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a chemistry hack that could take some of the pain out of the shots, potentially lowering the bar for uptake in an already wary population.\n\nThe lipid nanoparticles that house mRNA fragments have historically been designed by constructing one compound from two parts \u2014 \u201cmuch like two halves of a sandwich coming together,\u201d according to a recent UPenn article.\n\nThe team of engineers added a third component to create a more diverse set of lipid nanoparticles, and from there they found a chemical ring called a phenol group that reduced the number of extra molecules floating around after a shot, dampening the inflammation that causes achy arms and the next-day slog.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers showed in animal models that the immune response from the altered lipid nanoparticle recipe resulted in a five-fold improvement in immune response, according to a study published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The research was funded in part by the NIH.\n\n\u201cBy essentially changing the recipe for these lipids, we were able to make them work better with fewer side effects,\u201d said the paper\u2019s senior author, Michael Mitchell, an associate professor in bioengineering at UPenn. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\nMitchell and his research team \u2014 as well as study co-author and mRNA pioneer Drew Weissman \u2014 hope the new recipe for mRNA housing units can bring the technology into a new phase of readiness for biopharma innovation.\n\nA GLP-1 boost\n\nThe weight loss benefits of GLP-1 drugs have opened the floodgates to a new world of pharmaceutical innovation \u2014 and profit. Billions of dollars have poured into the industry over the last few years as companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk ramp up efforts to get their diabetes and weight loss medications to as many patients as possible.\n\nDetermining root causes of obesity by understanding genetic factors in young patients could help pinpoint who is at risk of gaining weight, allowing for earlier intervention.\n\nA new genetic test developed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and England\u2019s University of Bristol uses certain risk factors to create a polygenic risk score that could explain about 17% of a person\u2019s body mass variation. The new method is twice as effective as previous methods, according to the University of Bristol.\n\n\u201cObesity is a major public health issue, with many factors contributing to its development, including genetics, environment, lifestyle and behavior,\u201d said Kaitlin Wade, one of the authors of the paper and an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Bristol. \u201cThese factors likely vary across a person's life, and we believe that some of these originate in childhood.\u201d\n\nDrugmakers like Lilly and Novo might not reach more patients directly through a genetic test, but understanding the path to obesity could help them develop more effective treatments.\n\nAnd while the pharma giants seek new formulations for shots like Ozempic and Mounjaro to meet patients\u2019 needs, academic researchers are also on the case. A Stanford University materials scientist and bioengineer has developed a hydrogel that can potentially allow an injected GLP-1 to last longer in the body with the same effect. The hydrogel kept drug levels steady in rats for six weeks without breaking down. Normally, GLP-1s are taken daily or weekly.\n\nThe hydrogel has water-like properties and a jelly-like consistency, allowing it to flow through an injector needle like a liquid but then form into a \u201cblob\u201d in the body, releasing the drugs tirzepatide or semaglutide over time, said Stanford\u2019s Eric Appel, an author of the study, in a Science News article.\n\nAppel has licensed the technology after animal studies in hopes of bringing it to the clinic. While hydrogels have been used in drug delivery for this purpose over years, their potential application to GLP-1s could make the patient experience easier to maintain, especially as dropoffs have become more prevalent.",

        "summary": "**NIH-backed research boosts mRNA, GLP-1 innovation despite funding cuts.**\n\n**Key details:** Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania developed a new mRNA chemistry that adds a third component and a phenol group to lipid nanoparticles, reducing side effects and improving immune response five-fold in animal models. Separately, a Stanford University scientist created a hydrogel that sustained GLP-1 drug levels for six weeks in rats, potentially simplifying patient experience. Additionally, a new genetic test from the Universities of Copenhagen and Bristol can explain 17% of body mass variation, aiding obesity risk identification. All these advancements were partly NIH-funded.\n\n**Why it matters:** These innovations could revitalize the mRNA field, which has stalled due to political backlash and clinical stumbles, by addressing side effects and uptake challenges. For GLP-1s, the new hydrogel could counter prevalent patient drop-offs by simplifying adherence to treatments that are normally daily or weekly. This research, funded by the NIH, demonstrates continued U.S. leadership in biopharma innovation despite recent cuts to early research funding. These developments challenge the idea that progress in these areas is limited by current technical hurdles or funding shifts.\n\n**The big picture:** The U.S. has recently withdrawn commitments for early research funding at the National Institutes of Health, yet prior NIH funding continues to drive significant biopharma advancements. The mRNA technology, which saw rapid adoption for COVID-19 vaccines, has since stalled due to various challenges. Meanwhile, GLP-1 drugs have spurred massive investment and profit, creating a new wave of pharmaceutical innovation for weight loss. Researchers are seeking to improve both mRNA efficacy and GLP-1 patient experience.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   mRNA immune response: Five-fold improvement in animal models.\n*   Obesity genetic test: Explains 17% of body mass variation.\n*   Genetic test effectiveness: Twice as effective as prior methods.\n*   GLP-1 hydrogel: Sustained drug levels in rats for six weeks.\n*   GLP-1 frequency: Normally taken daily or weekly.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   National Institutes of Health (NIH): Its prior funding continues driving U.S. biopharma innovation despite recent commitment withdrawals.\n*   University of Pennsylvania: Researchers developed new mRNA chemistry to reduce side effects and improve immune response.\n*   Michael Mitchell: UPenn professor, senior author on mRNA recipe paper, hopes for new biopharma innovation.\n*   Stanford University: Location of scientist who developed a hydrogel for sustained GLP-1 drug delivery.\n*   Eric Appel: Stanford scientist who developed and licensed a hydrogel to extend GLP-1 drug duration.\n*   Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk: Companies ramping up efforts to get their GLP-1 medications to more patients.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Eric Appel has licensed the hydrogel technology, hoping to bring it to the clinic after animal studies.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** NIH-funded breakthroughs could reignite mRNA and enhance GLP-1 patient experience.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe promise of AI and machine learning-driven drug discovery has fueled excitement and investment in pharma for years.\n\nNow Bristol Myers Squibb is leveraging those technologies in an approach that not only conceptualizes and creates potential molecules, but validates and forecasts certain endpoints well before clinical trials.\n\nMike Ellis, SVP, head, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Discovery & Development Sciences Permission granted by Bristol Myers Squibb\n\n\u201cWe don't go into the lab and make things unless we have a good idea of what the forecast looks like,\u201d said Mike Ellis, senior vice president and head of Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Discovery & Development Sciences organization. \u201cWhat are we excited about? What do we think we can learn from this molecule? What may be the concerns that we need to clarify in the laboratory experimentally?\u201d\n\nEllis is spearheading BMS\u2019 AI efforts, which include developing and implementing proprietary AI/ML tools that can predict both success and potential stumbling blocks before molecules are synthesized, such as \u201csafety liability that could pop up later,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nAll of BMS\u2019 \u201cpredict first\u201d-enabled small molecule programs now use AI to evaluate properties like efficacy prior to synthesis, a significant leap from just 5% in 2021. BMS is applying a similar approach to nearly half of its large molecule experiments as well.\n\nOptimizing R&D has always been a priority but has become more pressing in the industry. Looming patent cliff losses are set to trigger billions in revenue losses for a number of pharma giants including BMS, which is losing exclusivity for moneymakers like Revlimid, Pomalyst and Sprycel in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe are enriching what we actually go and make and how we study it based on prediction.\u201d Mike Ellis SVP, head, Discovery & Development Sciences, BMS\n\nThose patent losses, along with increased R&D belt-tightening, are prompting companies to use AI to speed and de-risk the clinical development process. Pfizer just expanded its deal with AI firm XtalPi to develop accurate predictive tools for small molecules. Meanwhile, Amgen CEO Bob Bradway recently noted that the company is leveraging AI and machine learning \u201cto choose the right molecules more quickly and bypass the empirical trial and error process.\u201d\n\nChemistry meets computation\n\nEllis served as executive director of chemistry for Celgene until BMS acquired the company in 2019. Before that, he was part of the medicinal chemistry team at Merck & Co. A chemist by training, he\u2019s always \u201cdabbled\u201d with computational tools, including in his graduate work and post-doctoral fellowship, he said.\n\n\u201cFrom the first time I joined a medicinal chemistry team within the pharmaceutical industry, we were sitting around a table talking about programs with computational scientists in the room, bringing their perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt spoke to the shift in mindset for the lab experimentalist, and was reflective of some of the ways we changed even our team composition \u2026 [to] increase our number of computational scientists within the team [and] the ratio of computational scientists to lab experimentalists.\u201d\n\nNow, he believes the industry \u2014 and BMS \u2014 is at \u201can inflection point\u201d for the power of those tools.\n\n\u2018Choose your own adventure\u2019\n\nThere are always going to be multiple solutions to the same problem, and likewise, \u201cmultiple molecules that one could get to that could be safe and effective,\u201d Ellis said. The predict-first model allows BMS to increase the probability of advancing the most promising molecules by using AI to guide early decisions before committing resources to lab testing.\n\nWhile this approach is still like searching for a \u201cneedle in a haystack,\u201d it makes the pile of hay a bit smaller by moving away from a funnel-based screening approach and moving toward a \u201cchoose your own adventure,\u201d he said, allowing scientists to more precisely prioritize what molecules to make and how to test them based on AI-guided predictions.\n\n\u201cWe are enriching what we actually go and make and how we study it based on prediction,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSo rather than potentially redundant or incremental differences between molecules, we're trying to strategically approach what we go in the lab and make [and] what data we generate on those molecules so that it can inform the next cycle as effectively as possible.\u201d\n\nAmong the predict-first programs in the company\u2019s pipeline is an effort to find CELMoD agents for sickle cell disease.\n\nBMS is already studying CELMoD agents that target protein degradation to treat multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the company presented positive data for those programs in June.\n\nAlthough BMS knew it wanted to target protein degradation for sickle cell disease, Ellis said the company hit a \u201cplateau\u201d as it worked toward identifying a clinical candidate.\n\n\u201cWe have many parameters that we\u2019re going after in parallel. And often \u2026 you pull on one thread of those parameters and the other one breaks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can kind of get to all the pieces that you want in a molecule, except it\u2019s spread across five different molecules \u2026 How do we marry things all together?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the company \u201cstarted to bring more computational scientists, as well as models and tools\u201d into the program. Within weeks, they\u2019d crossed the months-long plateau.\n\n\u201cAs we started to apply prediction across what we saw as the most important parameters in a composite, computationally we started to move in directions that were different than where we had been before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to quickly get us into a better space where ultimately we were able to build each of those parameters into a single molecule as the ultimate goal.\u201d\n\nEllis called BMS\u2019 commitment to computational tools a \u201ccultural evolution\u201d in everything from determining which molecules move into the lab and how the company structures its teams, to embracing \u201chybrid intelligence\u201d that marries human and computational skills for \u201cenriching the quality of ideas and accelerating the decision making on programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we've appreciated and been proud of is the cultural progression and adoption that we've seen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's going to be increasingly embedded in what we do.\u201d",

The Eisai-partnered Alzheimer\u2019s drug notched a historic approval in 2021 but was later pulled from the market amid cost and efficacy controversies.\n\nIts other Alzheimer\u2019s treatment Leqembi has had a stronger showing on the market and has steadily risen in sales since last year. But Biogen has also been in cost-cutting mode since 2023 and expects revenue to decline this year.\n\nGoing forward, the company is leaning on its pipeline, including treatments for Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, to set the stage for future growth.\n\nIts latest manufacturing investment adds to the $10 billion it has funneled into North Carolina since setting up shop at Research Triangle Park in 1995.\n\nThermo Fisher snags Sanofi facility to boost fill-finish chops\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific is expanding its production prowess with the help of a growing Sanofi partnership.\n\nThe companies said this month that Thermo Fisher is snapping up a sterile, fill-finish manufacturing site from the French pharma for an undisclosed sum.

        "summary_text": "Reddit has published its latest performance report, showing steady increases in ad revenue and usage in Q2 2025, as it continues to refine and improve its business elements.\n\nThough its user growth did slow a little in the last three months, and its costs are rising.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the latest data from the Reddit team.\n\nFirst off, on users. Reddit rose to 110.4 million daily active users in Q2, a slight increase on its Q1 numbers.\n\nAs you can see in this chart, Reddit\u2019s international growth slowed significantly in Q2, while its U.S. usage remains fairly stagnant. That could suggest that Reddit\u2019s popularity is beginning to plateau, and the fact that it\u2019s losing momentum in international markets could be a concern.\n\nStill, Reddit says that it remains confident in its growth opportunities.\n\nAs per Reddit:\n\n\u201cWe see tremendous potential to grow our user base and deepen engagement, and we\u2019re moving quickly to align priorities and resources to capture that opportunity. As a first step, we clarified our product strategy and are investing in making Reddit a better experience for everyone who comes to the platform - whether they\u2019re scrolling their favorite subreddit, seeking input on a purchase, or discovering a new community for the first time.\u201d\n\nReddit says that its improving machine translation tools could help it gain more traction in more markets, while it\u2019s also becoming a more valuable tool for shopping discovery, with users coming to the platform to get real, human insights into products, as opposed to generic, AI-generated summaries.\n\nIndeed, Reddit says that 40% of Reddit posts are \u201ccommercial in nature.\u201d And with 80% of Reddit users noting that some questions can only be answered by humans, as opposed to AI-generated summaries, there is a significant crossover of information and opportunity within subreddit groups.\n\nThough Reddit does also have its own AI answers, via \u201cReddit Answers,\u201d which uses info sourced from relevant subreddits to provide overviews of user notes.\n\nReddit says that Reddit Answers has grown to 6 million weekly queries, while 70 million users are conducting weekly searches in the app.\n\nA coming expansion of Reddit Answers to all users will enable the platform to capitalize on this, and build a more dedicated AI product built entirely on Reddit\u2019s corpus of responses.\n\nSo while Reddit is in some ways eschewing more generalized AI answers, it\u2019s also looking to tap into the power of AI to maximize its own community insights, though given the value of subreddit reviews and informational notes, these could be a more valuable, more insightful approach to such.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Reddit brought in $500 million for the quarter, a significant increase from Q1.\n\nThe numbers reflect the platform\u2019s increasing focus on monetization, and building its business elements. Which Reddit hadn\u2019t made a significant focus in the past, but now, it\u2019s looking to tap into all the opportunities that it can to increase its revenue intake.\n\nOn that front, Reddit says that some of its newer ad offerings, like Conversations Summary Add-Ons, have been gaining traction.\n\nIt\u2019s another way for Reddit to make use of its conversations to tap into user interest, though it is also worth noting that Reddit\u2019s increasing investment in AI is also driving up its costs.\n\nThat\u2019ll be an element to watch in the coming months, as Reddit looks to deploy smarter ad options and tools via AI, while also maximizing its margins and building profit.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good report card for Reddit, though the slowing user growth could be a concern. The fact that Reddit\u2019s making more money out of its userbase is a positive sign, but if that growth does slow, that will also impact its future ad prospects.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Reddit's Q2 shows revenue growth, slowing user base amid rising AI costs.\n\n**Key details:** Reddit published its Q2 2025 performance report, revealing steady increases in ad revenue and usage. The company reported $500 million in revenue for the quarter, a significant increase from Q1, reflecting its new focus on monetization. Daily active users rose slightly to 110.4 million in Q2. However, user growth slowed, particularly internationally, and U.S. usage remained fairly stagnant. Reddit's increasing investment in AI is also driving up its costs.\n\n**Why it matters:** The slowing international user growth and stagnant U.S. usage suggest Reddit's popularity might be plateauing, challenging any consensus view of continuous high user expansion. This plateauing user growth could directly impact future ad prospects, despite current revenue gains. The rising costs due to AI investments will be a critical element for investors to watch as Reddit aims to maximize margins and build profit. The company's new focus on monetization signifies a shift in its business strategy.\n\n**The big picture:** Reddit is actively refining and improving its business elements, making a significant new focus on monetization opportunities. The company has clarified its product strategy and is investing in enhancing user experience on the platform. Reddit is leveraging improving machine translation tools and positioning itself as a valuable tool for shopping discovery, contrasting with generic AI summaries. It is also expanding its own AI answers product, \"Reddit Answers,\" which uses content from subreddits, with plans for broader deployment.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Daily active users: 110.4 million in Q2.\n*   Quarterly revenue: $500 million.\n*   Commercial posts: 40% of Reddit posts are \"commercial in nature.\"\n*   Weekly Reddit Answers queries: 6 million.\n*   Weekly in-app searches: 70 million users.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   Reddit: Published its Q2 2025 performance report showing increased revenue but slowing user growth and rising costs.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Watch for the impact of increasing AI investment on Reddit's costs and profitability in the coming months.\n*   The upcoming expansion of Reddit Answers to all users is expected to capitalize on AI-driven insights.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Reddit monetizes its user base as growth slows and AI investments rise.",

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDr. George Tidmarsh doesn\u2019t have an established track record in government service. But his history as a physician, academic, biotech entrepreneur and importantly, his blossoming ties to the FDA\u2019s new band of leadership, were enough to land him a top post at the agency.\n\nThe FDA announced this week that Tidmarsh will be the new director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the agency\u2019s main drug review division. The high-profile and multi-faceted post can lend itself to controversial decision-making.\n\n\u201cOn any given day [CDER directors are] balancing the workflows of dozens of INDs, NDAs and ANDAs, driving policy for things like real-world evidence and adaptive trials, and then turning around to co-chair international harmonization meetings,\u201d said Aman Khera, president of TOPRA, The Organization for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs, in an email. \u201cThe role is part scientist, part CEO, part diplomat.\u201d\n\n\"There\u2019s a real thirst for forward-looking guidance on cutting-edge modalities and a willingness from CDER.\" Aman Khera President, TOPRA, The Organization for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs\n\nTidmarsh replaces Dr. Jennifer Corrigan-Curay, who took over as acting director after Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni vacated the post along with several other FDA leaders just before President Donald Trump took office this year. Tidmarsh is coming into the agency as it grapples with job cuts that initially stranded 3,500 staffers before some employees were asked to return. At the same time, the FDA is pushing to modernize its review process through AI and other new policies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s relentless pressure to maintain review speed under flat or shrinking budgets, without cutting corners on safety,\u201d Khera said.\n\nWhile Tidmarsh\u2019s biotech background has triggered age-old concerns over the \u201crevolving door\u201d between the FDA and pharma, \u201cphysician-scientists or seasoned life-sciences executives\u201d are typically tapped to helm CDER, Khera said.\n\n\u201cThat bench-to-bedside trajectory, plus proven operational skills managing large, multidisciplinary teams, ensure they can translate cutting-edge science into efficient regulatory pathways,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring a transition for the agency that\u2019s triggered uncertainty for pharma, the industry is now craving predictability.\n\n\u201c[Pharma companies] want clear, consistent review timelines and transparent review criteria so they can plan development programs with confidence,\u201d Khera explained. \u201cBeyond that, there\u2019s a real thirst for forward-looking guidance on cutting-edge modalities and a willingness from CDER to pilot new regulatory-science approaches.\u201d\n\nHow effectively will Tidmarsh deliver on those expectations? A look at his career and past public comments offers clues.\n\nHis past in academia\n\nTidmarsh has long been associated with Stanford University, where he studied cancer biology and now serves as adjunct faculty of pediatrics and neonatology. Both FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary and NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya hailed from Stanford as well, and in a wide-ranging conversation with Makary on Monday, Tidmarsh called the university his \u201chome\u201d since he arrived there as an undergraduate in 1979.\n\nTidmarsh teaches clinical research and development, according to Stanford\u2019s faculty bio, but \u201c[h]e focuses most of his efforts currently on improving scientific data integrity in published literature.\u201d\n\nTidmarsh\u2019s connection to published literature has been controversial. He contributed to the Journal of the Academy of Public Health founded this year by Bhattacharya \u2014 which Bloomberg called a \u201cfringe medical journal\u201d connected with a conservative nonprofit and several other appointees to top government positions. The journal has been quiet since May.\n\nHis biotech pursuits\n\nTidmarsh is also known as a serial entrepreneur in biopharma. His first known founding effort was Threshold Pharmaceuticals, where he served as CEO from 2001 to 2006, according to LinkedIn, and which merged with Molecular Templates in 2017.\n\nTidmarsh was the founder of Horizon Therapeutics in 2005, serving as CEO until 2008. His tenure there was defined by an approval for a rheumatoid arthritis drug Duexis that was later subject to pricing controversies. Horizon, which focused on rare diseases after Tidmarsh\u2019s departure, was sold to Amgen for $28 billion in 2022.\n\nHe was also CEO of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company from 2011 to 2019, leading the development of a blood pressure drug that failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nTidmarsh is credited with bringing seven drugs to the market.\n\nHis latest role was at Revelation Biosciences\u2019 board of directors, which he stepped down from in May, informing fellow members that he \u201cwill be working closely with U.S. governmental agencies\u201d as a Stanford faculty member that could pose a conflict of interest.\n\nTidmarsh said his appointment to CDER came out of \u201cproximity\u201d to Makary and Bhattacharya, particularly during a dinner the three men shared in Washington, D.C., when Bhattacharya was nominated for the NIH role.\n\nPublic health critiques\n\nLike many of the FDA\u2019s new leaders, Tidmarsh has openly criticized public health policy, particularly the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19.\n\nDuring an interview on a podcast called \u201cDerate the Hate\u201d last year, Tidmarsh lambasted the lack of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d in public health during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cTypically, in academia there is a good debate that occurs over time to at least attempt to come to the right answer. That got short-cut in the pandemic,\u201d Tidmarsh told host Wilk Wilkinson, who pegged himself as a \u201cstaunch conservative\u201d during the episode. \u201cNot only did it not happen, but it turned into political polarization.\u201d\n\nTidmarsh also hinted at his support for the theory that the novel coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, a belief that has permeated right-leaning circles for years, and suggested that the NIH\u2019s \u201cguilt\u201d over its role in the pandemic could have contributed to its policy-making approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I have any evidence other than what\u2019s there publicly, but I can say that there clearly was some link between the NIH and the research that was done in Wuhan,\u201d Tidmarsh said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re worried you contributed to something that\u2019s going to be horrible \u2026 you don\u2019t want a lot of debate.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Tidmarsh was sympathetic to government leaders, noting that regardless of what decisions were made, he understood why agencies had to stick to their guns.\n\n\u201cOnce they decided on those rules, you can\u2019t fault them for being draconian about enforcing those,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a principle within public health and infectious diseases \u2026 because if you let it leak a little bit, it goes everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut an op-ed Tidmarsh penned this year also heaped criticisms onto former CBER director, Dr. Peter Marks, for his handling of approvals that included COVID vaccines, Biogen and Eisai\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment Aduhelm and Sarepta Therapeutics\u2019 gene therapy Elevidys, which was just pulled from the market this week following several patient deaths.\n\nHow he\u2019ll lead at FDA\n\nDespite his industry and academic bona fides, Tidmarsh has some leadership skills to learn, he admitted to Makary this week.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing I need to work on is motivating people,\u201d he said. \u201cI started companies, but I usually turned it over to someone else when it got to a certain size. La Jolla was probably the largest at about 600 people. Maybe the principles are the same, but \u2026 I have to be comfortable in that larger role.\u201d\n\nDuring his sit-down with Makary, Tidmarsh praised the FDA and its staff, and echoed the commissioner\u2019s mission to \u201cmodernize\u201d the agency, noting that reform efforts are not a criticism of past performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful agency,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience has been incredibly positive from the sponsor side, but I\u2019ve also seen growth and improvement, and I think there\u2019s more to grow and improve.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Tidmarsh said he wants to boost efficiency in reviews and establish more consistency in communication to sponsors working in the \u201csame disease state.\u201d\n\nThat consistency in how the FDA handles reviews, especially as it integrates new technologies, is one of the chief issues facing the agency, Khera said.\n\n\u201cIntegrating AI and real-world data into decision-making looks promising but risks inconsistent application across review divisions,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while the conversation with Makary didn\u2019t touch on lingering challenges related to public trust in health agencies, Tidmarsh indicated in his interview with Wilkinson that politics should be removed from public policy decisions.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to a neutrality where these institutions are very revered, they are depended upon by all of us, they do good, but they are apolitical,\u201d he said.",

It targets users spending at least 10 seconds on a website or landing page after clicking an ad. The tool offers metrics like Total Engaged Sessions and Cost per Engaged Session, which align with third-party analytics. Currently, this option is not live in TikTok Ads Manager and has not been communicated to ad partners.\n\n**Why it matters:** This test could significantly enhance TikTok's advertising value proposition by offering deeper, measurable insights into user conversion, potentially attracting more ad spend. However, it presents a notable risk given TikTok's past controversies concerning user tracking and data collection without explicit permission. This initiative challenges any perception that TikTok has fully resolved its privacy reputation, as it explores new tracking capabilities that could reignite user contention. Its success or failure could impact TikTok's ability to compete for advertiser budgets and navigate regulatory scrutiny.\n\n**The big picture:** TikTok regularly experiments with various features and tests, with many not becoming final products. The company has a history of controversy around tracking user activity, with reports suggesting it tracks more user actions than other apps.

Now, you\u2019ll have to do video calls instead. Which, if you only have 1,000 followers, will probably work anyway, but that\u2019ll also reduce any discoverability benefits that come from live-streaming on IG.\n\nSo why the change?\n\nI asked Meta about the update, and it told me\u2026 nothing.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t get back to me with an explanation on the update, so I can only speculate on the possible reasons.\n\nFor one, live-streaming is expensive to support, and maybe Meta decided that it\u2019s not worth paying to fund live-streams with only eight viewers. People can also use live-streams for less than savory purpose, by creating a new account, referring people to it, then broadcasting NSFW material. If it gets banned, so be it, and maybe, by increasing the threshold to 1,000 followers, that\u2019ll eliminate those who may be looking to use its tools for this purpose.\n\nIt could also help to increase the quality of live-streams, by ensuring that only people with some sort of audience can broadcast. Like, you\u2019re less likely to be a full kook if you have at least a thousand people following you, and maybe, that could then increase the overall perception of streaming as a medium.\n\nThe change also brings IG more into line with the live-streaming requirements of other platforms. On TikTok, users also need to have 1,000 followers to be able to live-stream, while YouTubers need at least 50 subscribers, which, considering the viewer-to-subscriber ratio, is probably about the same thing.\n\nYouTube also recently increased the age limit of live-streaming in the app to 16, the same age restriction that IG implemented back in April.\n\nSo there\u2019s been broader action on live-streaming in general, for seemingly various reasons, and this is just another update along the same lines.\n\nWhich, again, is bad news for smaller creators, but maybe you\u2019ll just have to put more time into building an audience before you broadcast.",

It will reduce discoverability benefits for them and push them towards video calls.\n\n**Why it matters:** This move indicates Instagram may be prioritizing cost efficiency, as live-streaming is expensive to support, and seeking to increase content quality.

As a result, many gaming creators, in particular, found themselves at risk of violating the rules, because the games that they\u2019re streaming sometimes feature violence, while creators also expressed frustration at how the new rules around profanity would limit monetization in all videos that featured bad language within the first 15 seconds.\n\nYouTube sought to address the concerns about profanity in 2023, by reducing its restriction on ads to only videos that included strong profanity within the first 7 seconds. Which was better, though many creators have still been frustrated by how the policy is applied.\n\nSo now, YouTube will let you maintain full monetization for clips, even if they do include bad language in the first seven seconds.\n\nAs explained by YouTube\u2019s head of monetization policy Connor Kavanagh:\n\n\u201cToday we're updating our Advertiser Friendly Guidelines for content with strong profanity in the first seven seconds. These uploads will now be eligible to earn full ad revenue [\u2026] Previously, uploads with strong profanity in the first seven seconds would not be eligible for monetization, and would have gotten the yellow dollar icon.\u201d\n\nFor those unaware, YouTube\u2019s basic monetization levels are:\n\nThere are further qualifiers within each segment, but these are the basic three levels of content monetization.\n\nSo, yellow monetization means some restriction, and YouTube\u2019s now removing this for videos that include swear words in those initial seconds.\n\nWhy do the first seconds of a video matter so much?\n\n\u201cAdvertisers expect ads on YouTube to have distance between profanity and the ad that just served. Those expectations have changed, and advertisers already have the ability to target content to their desired level of profanity.\u201d\n\nSo the early playback restriction relates to ad proximity, but YouTube is now confident that it can maintain monetization for clips that include such, based on the expanded placement controls that advertisers have.\n\nThough there are still some provisos around bad language in your videos:\n\n\u201cWhile you can now use these words in the first seven seconds without impacting monetization status, it's important to note that monetization will remain limited if you use moderate or strong profanity in titles or thumbnails. Additionally, [videos that include] strong profanity with high frequency will still face restrictions.\u201d\n\nIn summary, bad language in your videos will now have less impact on your monetization potential, but a lot of bad language will still lead to restrictions.\n\nSeems pretty straightforward, but you can refer to YouTube\u2019s updated Advertiser Friendly Guidelines for more insight.",

Uploads featuring strong profanity in the initial seven seconds are now eligible for full ad revenue.

        "summary_text": "TikTok has launched an alternative version of app in Europe which seemingly aims to to put more focus on the positive, beneficial aspects of the TikTok experience via the incorporation of a new initiative that makes it easier to support charity organizations in the app,\n\nTikTok\u2019s new app is called \u201cTikTok Pro,\u201d and is now available for download in Germany, Portugal and Spain, with more regions to follow. TikTok says that the alternate version of the app will allow \u201cpeople to experience and engage with joyful and entertaining content.\u201d\n\nWhich implies that this is different to the main TikTok app, because of the focus on positive, educational content.\n\nAs per the TikTok Pro description on the German App Store:\n\n\u201cTikTok Pro is a global video community where you can discover the coolest, funniest, and most educational short videos and share special moments with your friends. A useful app with a whole world within itself. TikTok Pro gives you the best video experience with helpful videos, engaging STEM content, and more personal expression.\u201d\n\nSo it sounds like a custom, more positivity-focused TikTok experience, though TikTok has informed me that this is not the case.\n\nTikTok says that the content in TikTok Pro is exactly the same as the videos that are displayed in the main app.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference?\n\nWell, TikTok Pro is solely focused on the content, with no live-streams, no shopping, and no ads.\n\nYes, no ads. TikTok says that the idea is to encourage non TikTok users to try out the app, with all of these other elements removed to simplify the experience.\n\nThe other key difference is that TikTok Pro also comes with TikTok\u2019s new \u201cSunshine\u201d program built in, which \u201coffers a unique way for charities and NGOs to engage with new audiences, and allows the TikTok Pro community to support them.\u201d\n\nAs per TikTok:\n\n\u201cUsers can accumulate 'virtual Sunshine' by referring others to join and by engaging with content from charities, such as liking or reposting charity videos, following charity-related accounts and performing charity-related searches. People can then use that virtual Sunshine on a charity in the programme, and TikTok will make a donation to that charity.\u201d\n\nSo again, it\u2019s regular TikTok, but a simplified version, with charity donation processes built into the app direct. So it\u2019s less about getting you to buy stuff, and more about getting you to help others, with the whole principle of the new app being focused on facilitating a simplified experience.\n\nSo why does TikTok need another app to do this?\n\nI asked exactly this, and TikTok explained that it's about showcasing the app\u2019s content to more people, without some of the regular elements. TikTok says that this isn\u2019t about re-focusing on more positive elements, as such, but the removal of ads and shopping, as well as live-streaming, does seem to suggest that these could be elements that don\u2019t appeal to some audiences, for whatever reason.\n\nIt could also be an attempt to better align with local market regulators and rules, with TikTok still under scrutiny in many regions.\n\nIndeed, German politicians have repeatedly raised questions about the app, with some suggesting that TikTok should be banned due to the danger it poses to democracy, as \u201can instrument\" in China and Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare.\u201d\n\nThe EU Commission has also raised questions about TikTok\u2019s influence on younger users in particular, after recent controversy around the rise of the #SkinnyTok hashtag, which encouraged potentially harmful behaviors. EU regulators are also still exploring TikTok\u2019s algorithmic approach with respect to the EU Digital Services Act, and it could be that this new TikTok Pro app aligns with broader efforts by TikTok to address related concerns.\n\nAnd while TikTok says that this is not intended to provide a more positive user experience, as such, that is an interesting consideration in the context of how the local Chinese version of TikTok operates, with the Chinese Government overseeing content trends, and ensuring that more beneficial elements are promoted to Chinese youth.\n\nMy initial view was that this could be an experiment on that front, though I doubt that many non-Communist countries will be overly welcoming of such controls.\n\nTikTok says that this isn\u2019t the case either way, with the streamlined version of the app designed only to better highlight TikTok\u2019s main content feed. I mean, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d need another app for that, especially at the risk of cannibalizing your main app, but that\u2019s what TikTok tells me is the aim.\n\nTikTok says that it\u2019s partnering with a number of global and local charities on its Sunshine program, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res / Doctors Without Borders (MSF), WaterAid, Aktion Deutschland Hilft and the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU). It\u2019s also looking to add more charity partners over time.\n\nIt seems like an interesting concept, though it\u2019ll probably be a hard sell getting people to switch over to an alternate, less functional version of the app.\n\nBut then again, that\u2019s not the aim, it's focused on expanding TikTok\u2019s reach with non-users, though having them in an alternative app doesn\u2019t really make much sense as a growth strategy.\n\nMaybe, eventually, TikTok will be able to pitch this alternative version as an option for younger users, or TikTok could look to push it in other ways.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s an interesting development amid ongoing concerns about social media regulation and restriction.",

This new version removes live-streams, shopping features, and advertisements, simplifying the user experience. It also integrates a \"Sunshine\" program, allowing users to support charities by engaging with content or referring others. While TikTok states content is identical to the main app, the simplified approach aims to encourage non-TikTok users to try the platform.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe removal of ads, shopping, and live-streaming suggests these elements may not appeal to all audiences, challenging the traditional social media monetization model. This move could be an effort by TikTok to better align with local market regulators and rules given ongoing scrutiny in many regions. It potentially addresses concerns from the EU Commission about the app's influence on younger users and its algorithmic approach. This strategic simplification deviates from the consensus of maximizing user monetization and engagement through all available features.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTikTok is currently facing significant scrutiny from various authorities in Europe. German politicians have questioned the app, suggesting it poses a danger to democracy as a potential \"instrument\" in hybrid warfare.

        "summary_text": "LinkedIn has done it again.\n\nEvery quarter, LinkedIn\u2019s parent company Microsoft posts its performance update, which outlines all of its various tech projects and elements, and how they\u2019ve fared over the preceding three months.\n\nAnd every time, without fail, in literally every update on LinkedIn\u2019s performance since 2018 (except one), in virtually every report since it acquired the platform, Microsoft has reported the exact same thing:\n\n\u201cLinkedIn saw record levels of engagement.\u201d\n\nWhich seems impossible, right? Surely LinkedIn can\u2019t be seeing \u201crecord levels\u201d of engagement every single quarter. Right?\n\nWhat about the Christmas period, LinkedIn\u2019s seeing \u201crecord levels\u201d of engagement then, over and above regular interaction? I mean, sure, LinkedIn\u2019s always adding more users (or members at least), and that should lead to more interaction and engagement. But LinkedIn also lost 54 million users when it shut down its app in China back in 2021, which, you would assume, would have had some impact on this element.\n\nSurely it can\u2019t be setting a new record for engagement in the app every single quarter.\n\nRight?\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s see what Microsoft has reported in its latest earnings update?\n\nOh wow, what a surprise. LinkedIn saw a 9% increase in overall revenue, and 7% sessions growth, with \u201crecord engagement.\u201d\n\nCool cool, all makes sense, record levels. Sure.\n\nOf course, these are only surface-level stats, and we don\u2019t have enough to go on to make a real assessment of LinkedIn\u2019s actual activity levels. As such, we also don\u2019t know what \u201csessions growth\u201d actually relates to without a reference point, though in its accompanying earnings call, LinkedIn did also note that comments are up over 30%, and video uploads have increased by more than 20% this year.\n\nSo, more direct interactions, while video has become a much bigger consideration for LinkedIn users.\n\nLinkedIn also recently reported that videos are 20x more likely to be shared in the app, while video content also generates 1.4x more engagement than other post types.\n\nWorth considering in your approach.\n\nIn terms of overall growth, LinkedIn has also reported that it\u2019s now up to 1.2 billion members, rising from the billion that it reported in July last year.\n\nOf course, as always, it\u2019s worth noting that \u201cmembers\u201d and \u201cactive users\u201d are two different things, and on that front, LinkedIn\u2019s active usage is more likely around 400 million monthly users.\n\nBut it sounds good, I guess. \u201cRecord levels\u201d of engagement, \u201c1.2 billion members.\u201d It sounds better than \u201cslight increase in engagement\u201d and \u201c400 million MAU.\u201d And Microsoft isn\u2019t obligated to report anything further, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s doing anything wrong, it just seems a little unclear, and potentially misleading as to LinkedIn\u2019s actual performance.\n\nThat\u2019s also become a point of contention among LinkedIn users, who have reported seeing more and more examples of automated engagement, and engagement pod activity in the app.\n\nEngagement pods are coordinated groups of users that work together to comment, like and engage with each other\u2019s posts, in order to boost their reach via platform algorithms. And like other social apps, there\u2019s a range of platforms and offerings that provide LinkedIn pods as a service, and LinkedIn users have provided data to SMT which shows that artificial engagement activity like this is fairly common in the app.\n\nThe scale of such is relative. Thousands of posts that see artificial engagement activity, based on millions of active users, may not be as significant as it might seem to the individual user. But there are clearly a lot of artificial engagements happening in the app, which are getting harder to detect due to the adoption of AI tools to create such.\n\nCombine that with LinkedIn coaches who encourage users to comment and engage as much as they can in the app, in order to increase their visibility, which in itself could indirectly contribute to engagement pod activity, and this is a difficult challenge to police, though LinkedIn tells me that it is working to address it.\n\nI spoke to LinkedIn about the concerns with engagement pods and automated engagement, and its team is well aware of the concern, and is actively working to improve its detection and enforcement measures. LinkedIn says that it reduces the reach of such activity when detected, while it\u2019s also looking to educate creators on how, and why they should avoid such activity.\n\nIn addition, LinkedIn says that its actively taking action against engagement pods that violate its Terms of Service through behaviors like automation. And while some of this activity is difficult for LinkedIn itself to enforce, given that such programs are often coordinated off-platform, it is aware of the engagement pod services that it exist, which is another area it\u2019s exploring.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t provide in-depth insight into its plans on this front, but LinkedIn has been pursuing legal action against other services for different violations of its usage terms, and at least some of these engagement pod groups could soon be in its sights on this front as well.\n\nBut essentially, LinkedIn is aware of the concern. And while it may be frustrating for LinkedIn users who are seeking to build their presence the right way, and it may seem like LinkedIn isn\u2019t doing enough to address it (because, as some have suggested, LinkedIn benefits from the resulting engagement), LinkedIn is aware of the problem, and it is looking to address such misuse.\n\nMicrosoft has also made note of LinkedIn\u2019s evolving AI tools, with the platform looking to \u201cbring AI to every part of the LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales.\u201d\n\nAgents are part of LinkedIn\u2019s next big AI push, with AI bots that can undertake tasks on your behalf, while LinkedIn has also added a range of generative AI elements to the post and profile creation process.\n\nWhich probably also ties back into the broader concerns with artificial engagement in the app, and could be another factor clouding LinkedIn\u2019s enforcement of this element. But with Microsoft investing big into OpenAI, it\u2019s keen to add AI everywhere that it can, and as such, LinkedIn is inevitable also going to see an increase in AI generated interaction.\n\nOverall, however, LinkedIn\u2019s performance seems pretty solid, with more engagement, particularly with video content, though concerns to be addressed with fake interactions. But LinkedIn remains the key platform for professional connection, and amidst tougher economic conditions, it will continue to be an increasingly relevant and valuable tool for such.\n\nThanks to Elliot Grossbard for providing additional data for this story.",

Despite these figures, concerns are rising among users about widespread automated engagement and \"engagement pod\" activity. LinkedIn states it is actively working to improve detection and enforcement measures against these artificial interactions.\n\n**Why it matters:** Microsoft's consistent \"record engagement\" claims for LinkedIn are being challenged by user reports of widespread artificial activity from \"engagement pods\" and AI tools. This raises questions about the true organic growth and engagement levels, potentially making LinkedIn's stated performance \"unclear, and potentially misleading.\" The presence of artificial engagement could distort the perception of user activity, challenging the assumption that all reported growth is purely authentic. While LinkedIn benefits from this engagement, the issue might undermine investor confidence in the platform's underlying user health.\n\n**The big picture:** Microsoft has consistently reported \"record levels of engagement\" for LinkedIn since 2018, which has led to skepticism given its continuous nature.

However, revenue increased by 2.4% compared to Q1. The company's operating ratio rose to 74.6% in Q2, up from 71.9% a year ago. Management stated that operating costs can rise when volume decreases due to the company's commitment to superior service. Other LTL peers, including ArcBest and TFI International, also experienced sequential revenue upticks in Q2.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nOld Dominion's Q2 performance, with a year-over-year revenue decline and a rising operating ratio, signals challenges in efficiency and top-line growth. This data point might challenge a consensus view that the LTL industry is experiencing a robust recovery, as sequential improvements are noted as less useful due to seasonal trends. The company's strategy to protect \"superior service\" despite volume declines suggests a long-term focus that may impact short-term profitability. The broader industry context reveals volumes significantly lower than pandemic peaks, highlighting persistent weakness. Management's stance against \"chasing bad revenue\" indicates a disciplined approach that prioritizes long-term fit over immediate volume.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Less-than-truckload (LTL) industry is currently in a three-year downcycle, navigating a very weak demand environment. Industry volumes are approximately 15% lower than the surge experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies like Old Dominion are managing costs and protecting service in this challenging landscape. While year-over-year comparisons show a slower environment, some LTL peers, including ArcBest and TFI International, saw sequential revenue increases in Q2, similar to Old Dominion. This indicates a general trend of marginal sequential improvement despite the broader market headwinds.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Old Dominion Q2 revenue: $1.41 billion\n*   Old Dominion year-over-year revenue decline: ~6%\n*   Old Dominion Q2 operating ratio: 74.6%\n*   Industry volumes: 15% lower than COVID-19 pandemic demand surge\n*   ArcBest Q2 revenue compared to Q1: up 5.7%\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Old Dominion Freight Line:** Reported Q2 financial results showing revenue decline and increased operating ratio.\n*   **Adam Satterfield:** ODFL's EVP and CFO, commented on sequential comparisons and disciplined revenue strategy.\n*   **Kevin \u201cMarty\u201d Freeman:** ODFL's President and CEO, expressed confidence in long-term operating ratio improvement.\n*   **ArcBest:** LTL peer that experienced a similar sequential revenue uptick in Q2.\n*   **TFI International:** Another LTL peer whose LTL segment also saw sequential revenue increase in Q2.\n*   **Matt Beasley:** ArcBest CFO, discussed the company's disciplined pricing strategy and securing deferred rate increases.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nOld Dominion faces revenue and efficiency headwinds in a weak LTL market.",

The resulting company aims to create a unified coast-to-coast network that enhances service efficiency.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Transaction aimed to close in 2027.\n*   Merger application to be submitted in the next six months.\n*   Combined network to connect over 50,000 route miles.\n*   Network spans 43 states, with access to 10 international interchanges.\n*   The new entity will link with approximately 100 ports.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Union Pacific:** Entered agreement to merge networks and form the new transcontinental railroad.\n*   **Norfolk Southern:** Agreed to merge networks with Union Pacific to create a combined entity.\n*   **Surface Transportation Board:** Federal agency tasked with reviewing and approving the proposed merger application.\n*   **Jim Vena:** Current Union Pacific CEO, slated to lead the combined company for at least five years.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The companies plan to submit their merger application to the Surface Transportation Board within the next six months.\n*   The transaction is targeted to close in 2027, pending regulatory approval.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Major rail consolidation aims for a more competitive, efficient U.S. freight network.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** US Extends Mexico Tariff Pause; New Duties Hit India, Brazil\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. extended its pause on country-specific tariffs for certain imports from Mexico by 90 days. This decision followed a Thursday call between President Trump and President Sheinbaum. The moratorium applies to goods adhering to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. However, imports of cars, steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico will still face U.S. sectoral duties. Non-USMCA-compliant goods have already been subject to a 25% tariff during the pause.\n\n**Why it matters:** The extension avoids the previously announced 30% tariff increase for Mexico that was slated to begin on Friday. This challenges the implied market expectation that Mexico would face new country-specific tariffs as part of the Trump administration's broader resumption of duties. Instead, Mexico receives a 90-day reprieve to negotiate a long-term agreement. This differentiates Mexico from other countries like India and Brazil, which will face new tariffs starting Friday or in August.\n\n**The big picture:** The U.S. Trump administration plans to resume country-specific duties following a monthslong pause, with these new tariffs largely starting Friday. The administration has secured various agreements and framework deals with trading partners like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea prior to this return of tariffs. However, new 25% tariffs will be imposed on imports from India starting Friday. Imports from Brazil will also face a 40% tariff, effective August 6.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   30%: Tariff slated for Mexico imports, now avoided.\n*   90 days: Extension of the moratorium on tariffs for USMCA-compliant Mexican goods.\n*   25%: Tariff on non-USMCA-compliant Mexican goods during the pause.\n*   25%: Tariff to be imposed on imports from India starting Friday.\n*   40%: Tariff to be imposed on imports from Brazil, effective Aug. 6.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **U.S. President Donald Trump:** Decided to extend Mexico's tariff pause and impose new tariffs on India and Brazil.\n*   **Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum:** Announced avoiding tariff increase and gaining 90 days for trade agreement negotiations.\n*   **European Union:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the U.S.\n*   **Japan:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the U.S.\n*   **South Korea:** Reached a trade agreement or framework deal with the U.S.\n*   **India:** Imports will face new 25% tariffs starting Friday.\n*   **Brazil:** Imports will face new 40% tariffs effective August 6.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The U.S. and Mexico will negotiate over the next three months.\n*   The goal is to sign a long-term trade deal within that 90-day period.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Mexico avoids immediate new tariffs while other nations face new U.S. duties.",

Retrieved from EPA\n\nThe Clean Freight Coalition, which represents major trucking associations such as the ATA, National Private Truck Council and Truckload Carriers Association, also voiced support for the EPA\u2019s proposed shift.\n\nCFC Executive Director Jim Mullen said the move would be a critical step toward rescinding the heavy-duty greenhouse gas phase three rule from last year.\n\n\u201cThe CFC members have consistently opposed the unattainable targets included in this rule that would cause tremendous harm to the trucking industry, jeopardize the supply chain and result in higher prices for goods across our country,\u201d he said in an emailed statement.\n\nConcerns raised for EV, battery plants\n\nBut the nonprofit Calstart, which advocates for clean transportation technologies, said the proposal seeks to dismantle vehicle emissions standards for new passenger and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\n\u201cWhen this proposal goes through, it could very well undermine new EV and battery plant manufacturing investments in Kansas, Indiana, Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas,\u201d Calstart President and CEO John Boesel said in a statement. \u201cBy rolling back these standards, the EPA is handing the advantage to the oil industry and foreign competitors, further weakening U.S. leadership in the global clean transportation race.\u201d\n\nThe existing framework, set by former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson during the Obama administration, found that six greenhouse gases constitute a threat to public health and welfare. The rulemaking said the pollution causes more severe hurricanes, serious health effects due to adverse air quality, and greater storm surge and flooding risks from rising sea levels in coastal areas.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe proposal requires the EPA in rulemaking to make its case for changing the existing framework and accept public comments, a process that could take months or years, a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted last month.\n\nThe proposed move will also require judicial review, the report said.\n\nThe agency may also need to defend its proposal in light of reaffirmations of the existing framework in 2016 and 2022, the report said. But the EPA suggested new evidence will help its case.\n\n\u201cMuch has changed since the 2009 Endangerment Finding was issued, including new scientific and technological developments that warrant review,\u201d the EPA said, adding that major Supreme Court decisions have \u201cemphasized that major policy determinations must be made by Congress, not by administrative agencies.\u201d",

        "summary": "**Headline:** EPA moves to rescind key finding, easing truck emissions rules.\n\n**Key details:** The Environmental Protection Agency is working to rescind a 2009 scientific finding that underpinned major greenhouse gas emissions rulemaking for heavy-duty trucks. This policy overhaul, led by current EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, could overturn existing rules for truck and engine manufacturers. The original finding identified electricity generation, then transportation, as leading emission sectors. If approved, this move would specifically target rescinding the heavy-duty greenhouse gas phase three rule from last year.\n\n**Why it matters:** This proposed policy is a dramatic shift that has drawn praise from industry advocacy groups. The Clean Freight Coalition states that rescinding the rule would counter \"unattainable targets\" that threaten the trucking industry, supply chain, and pricing. Conversely, clean transportation advocates at Calstart contend the proposal seeks to dismantle vehicle emissions standards for new vehicles. They warn it could undermine U.S. investments in new EV and battery plant manufacturing and weaken U.S. leadership in clean transportation. This directly challenges the ongoing industry and regulatory push towards stricter vehicle emissions standards and clean energy investment.\n\n**The big picture:** The EPA is targeting a 2009 scientific finding that served as the foundation for subsequent regulations, including tougher heavy-duty truck requirements. This decision, made by former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson during the Obama administration, found six greenhouse gases threaten public health. The original rulemaking linked pollution to more severe hurricanes, adverse air quality health effects, and increased flooding risks. The Trump administration previously described these regulations as \"overreaching and costly.\"\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   2009: Year of the original EPA administrator's decision to be rescinded.\n*   2016 and 2022: Years the existing framework was reaffirmed.\n*   Last year: When tougher heavy-duty truck emissions requirements were unveiled.\n*   Six: Number of greenhouse gases identified as a public health threat by the existing framework.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Agency proposing to rescind a 2009 scientific finding on greenhouse gas emissions.\n*   **Lee Zeldin:** Current EPA Administrator leading the policy overhaul impacting truck and engine manufacturers.\n*   **American Trucking Associations (ATA):** Industry group that expressed support for the EPA's proposed shift.\n*   **Chris Spear:** President and CEO of ATA, who stated the trucking industry supports cleaner technologies rooted in real-world conditions.\n*   **Clean Freight Coalition (CFC):** Group representing major trucking associations, voiced support for the proposed EPA shift.\n*   **Jim Mullen:** CFC Executive Director, stating the move is critical to rescinding heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule.\n*   **Calstart:** Nonprofit advocating for clean transportation technologies, stated the proposal would dismantle emissions standards.\n*   **John Boesel:** President and CEO of Calstart, warned the proposal could undermine EV and battery plant investments.\n*   **Lisa Jackson:** Former EPA Administrator who set the existing framework finding greenhouse gases threaten public health.\n*   **Congressional Research Service:** Nonpartisan body that noted the proposal requires rulemaking, public comments, and judicial review.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The EPA must make its case for changing the existing framework and accept public comments in a rulemaking process.\n*   The proposed move will also require judicial review.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** EPA's proposed rule rollback challenges clean energy transition, benefits traditional trucking.",

However, revenue increased 2.4% sequentially compared to Q1. Its operating ratio rose to 74.6% in Q2, up from 71.9% a year ago. Other LTL peers like ArcBest and TFI International also reported similar sequential revenue upticks in Q2. ArcBest's revenue was up 5.7% sequentially to $1 billion.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe sequential revenue improvement, despite seasonal trends, is helpful amid a three-year downcycle for the industry. Old Dominion is managing costs and protecting service in a very weak environment. Its operating ratio worsened as volumes decreased due to the company's commitment to superior service. This challenges a consensus of pure decline, suggesting a potential sequential stabilization for LTL revenue. However, the rising operating ratio indicates efficiency challenges persist in a low-volume market.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) industry is contending with volumes approximately 15% lower than during the demand surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reflects a broader three-year downcycle for the sector. Companies are maintaining a disciplined pricing strategy, refusing to chase \"bad revenue.\" This approach continues even as many shippers are intensely focused on achieving cost savings.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **Old Dominion Q2 Revenue:** $1.41 billion\n*   **Old Dominion YoY Revenue Decline:** Roughly 6%\n*   **Old Dominion Q2 Operating Ratio:** 74.6% (vs. 71.9% a year ago)\n*   **LTL Industry Volume Decline:** 15% lower than pandemic surge\n*   **ArcBest Q2 Sequential Revenue Increase:** 5.7% (to $1 billion)\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Old Dominion Freight Line:** Reported Q2 revenue decline year-over-year but a sequential increase.\n*   **Adam Satterfield:** Old Dominion EVP and CFO, noted revenue improvement helps in a downcycle.\n*   **Kevin \u201cMarty\u201d Freeman:** Old Dominion President and CEO, expressed confidence in improving long-term operating ratio.\n*   **ArcBest:** LTL peer experiencing a similar sequential revenue uptick, with a 5.7% increase.\n*   **TFI International:** LTL peer whose LTL segment saw a 3.6% sequential revenue increase.\n*   **Matt Beasley:** ArcBest CFO, highlighted securing 4% average deferred price increases.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\nNot mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nOld Dominion's sequential revenue growth signals a potential bottom in a weak freight market.",

This extension follows a Thursday call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Imports from Mexico were slated to incur a 30% tariff starting Friday, following a monthslong pause. However, imports of cars, steel, aluminum, and copper from Mexico will still face U.S. sectoral duties. Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced new 25% tariffs on India starting Friday, and 40% tariffs on Brazil effective August 6.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe 90-day extension of the tariff pause for Mexico avoids the immediate imposition of a 30% duty that was slated for Friday. This may challenge a view expecting broad country-specific tariffs to resume uniformly, as Mexico received a temporary reprieve for USMCA-compliant goods. It signals ongoing negotiation rather than an immediate escalation of trade tensions with Mexico. Conversely, the immediate implementation of new tariffs on India and Brazil shows a selective approach to trade policy. This could challenge views expecting a uniform delay or resolution of trade disputes across all partners, demonstrating varied outcomes.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Trump administration plans to resume country-specific duties starting Friday, following a monthslong pause. Non-USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico have been subject to a 25% tariff during this pause. The U.S. and Mexico will continue to negotiate over the next three months to build a long-term agreement and sign a trade deal.

This surge reflected a hotter market and lucrative resale values reaching more than two-year highs. Used pricing for equipment rose year over year for the first time in over two-and-a-half years. Additionally, a Texas Supreme Court decision reversed a $90 million jury award, leading to a reversal of a $45.7 million net liability.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters because Werner Enterprises strengthened Q2 margins significantly due to factors outside core freight operations, potentially challenging a broader negative view on the trucking industry. The lucrative resale values for used equipment, reaching two-year highs, and the first year-over-year price increase in over two-and-a-half years, indicate an unexpected hot market despite a \"stubborn freight recession.\" Furthermore, a Texas Supreme Court decision reversed a $90 million jury award, directly benefiting Werner's GAAP operating income by $45.7 million.

Werner's executives noted the benefit from tariff and other macro uncertainty, which drove elevated tractor pricing. This meant fewer unit sales but increased profit from equipment.

U.S. exports to the country stood at $66 billion last year, with South Korea accounting for 3.7% of U.S. trade, according to U.S. International Trade Commission data.\n\nTrump has reached some level of agreement with several U.S. trading partners regarding tariffs and other trade policies in the past 10 days, including the European Union, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Trump Announces US-South Korea Trade Deal with New Tariffs and Investments\n\n**Key details:**\nPresident Donald Trump announced a \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" with South Korea via a Truth Social post. If finalized, the U.S. would implement a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, while U.S. goods entering Korea would not face tariffs. South Korea would also invest $350 million in the U.S. and commit to buying $100 billion in energy products. Additionally, South Korea would be fully open to U.S. products, including cars, trucks, and agriculture. This proposed deal alters a previously announced 25% tariff set to begin August 1.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis new \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" outlines a 15% U.S. tariff on South Korean imports, a reduction from the 25% tariff previously announced for August 1. It also includes substantial South Korean investments and energy purchases benefiting the U.S. This information might challenge the prior consensus view of escalating trade tensions with South Korea, indicating a potentially more amicable and structured trade relationship. Investors might reassess trade flows and company strategies impacted by the new tariff rates and investment opportunities. The agreement for South Korea to accept American products could open new markets for U.S. exporters.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPresident Trump has recently reached trade agreements with multiple U.S. trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This proposed deal with South Korea follows a prior announcement for country-specific reciprocal tariffs to return on August 1. The U.S. imported $132 billion from South Korea in 2024 and exported $66 billion last year. South Korea currently accounts for 3.7% of U.S. trade, according to U.S. International Trade Commission data. This agreement signifies ongoing efforts to reshape U.S. trade relationships.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   **15%**: Proposed U.S. tariff on South Korean imports under the new deal.\n*   **25%**: Previously announced tariff on South Korean imports starting August 1.\n*   **$350 million**: South Korean investments to the U.S. under the proposed deal.\n*   **$100 billion**: Value of energy products South Korea will buy.\n*   **$132 billion**: U.S. goods imported from South Korea in 2024.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Donald Trump**: U.S. President who announced the new \"Full and Complete Trade Deal\" with South Korea.\n*   **Lee Jae Myung**: South Korea's President, scheduled to meet Trump at the White House within two weeks.\n*   **South Korea**: Nation agreeing to new U.S. trade deal, including tariffs, investments, and product acceptance.\n*   **European Union**: One of several U.S. trading partners reaching trade agreements with Trump recently.\n*   **U.S. International Trade Commission**: Provided data on U.S.-South Korea trade figures cited in the article.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   South Korea President Lee Jae Myung's White House visit in two weeks, to reveal an undisclosed investment sum.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNew US-South Korea trade deal announced, altering tariffs and securing investments.",

Retrieved from EPA\n\nThe Clean Freight Coalition, which represents major trucking associations such as the ATA, National Private Truck Council and Truckload Carriers Association, also voiced support for the EPA\u2019s proposed shift.\n\nCFC Executive Director Jim Mullen said the move would be a critical step toward rescinding the heavy-duty greenhouse gas phase three rule from last year.\n\n\u201cThe CFC members have consistently opposed the unattainable targets included in this rule that would cause tremendous harm to the trucking industry, jeopardize the supply chain and result in higher prices for goods across our country,\u201d he said in an emailed statement.\n\nConcerns raised for EV, battery plants\n\nBut the nonprofit Calstart, which advocates for clean transportation technologies, said the proposal seeks to dismantle vehicle emissions standards for new passenger and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\n\u201cWhen this proposal goes through, it could very well undermine new EV and battery plant manufacturing investments in Kansas, Indiana, Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas,\u201d Calstart President and CEO John Boesel said in a statement. \u201cBy rolling back these standards, the EPA is handing the advantage to the oil industry and foreign competitors, further weakening U.S. leadership in the global clean transportation race.\u201d\n\nThe existing framework, set by former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson during the Obama administration, found that six greenhouse gases constitute a threat to public health and welfare. The rulemaking said the pollution causes more severe hurricanes, serious health effects due to adverse air quality, and greater storm surge and flooding risks from rising sea levels in coastal areas.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe proposal requires the EPA in rulemaking to make its case for changing the existing framework and accept public comments, a process that could take months or years, a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted last month.\n\nThe proposed move will also require judicial review, the report said.\n\nThe agency may also need to defend its proposal in light of reaffirmations of the existing framework in 2016 and 2022, the report said. But the EPA suggested new evidence will help its case.\n\n\u201cMuch has changed since the 2009 Endangerment Finding was issued, including new scientific and technological developments that warrant review,\u201d the EPA said, adding that major Supreme Court decisions have \u201cemphasized that major policy determinations must be made by Congress, not by administrative agencies.\u201d",

This marks the company's third straight quarterly operating loss, following previous hits in Q4 2025 and Q1. The Q2 truckload operating ratio was 112.5%, with total miles and loads declining.\n\n**Why it matters:** PAMT's Q2 results, described as \"arguably its worst quarter,\" raise significant concerns about the company's financial stability and operational performance. This poor performance occurred shortly after the CEO resigned, potentially exacerbating investor uncertainty. While the article notes declining truckload revenues across the industry, PAMT's sustained losses and high operating ratio, coupled with internal changes, could challenge expectations of a quick turnaround or suggest more severe company-specific challenges compared to some industry peers.\n\n**The big picture:** PAMT, parent of carrier P.A.M. Transport, has experienced consistent financial struggles, including an adjusted operating loss in Q4 2025. The company's Chairman, Matthew Moroun, recently stepped in as interim president and CEO after the former CEO resigned. PAMT's logistics segment helped mitigate the overall operating ratio.

Data centers and other industrial customers coming online in Indiana, Ohio and Texas largely drove the increase, he said, resulting in about $200 million in additional revenue.\n\nAEP, based in Columbus, Ohio, expects weather-normalized retail electricity sales by its utilities will increase 5.7% this year, up from 3% growth in 2024. The company anticipates sales will jump 8.4% next year and 8.9% in 2027, according to an earnings presentation.\n\nIn part due to those new load expectations, AEP expects this fall it will increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30%, to about $70 billion, up from $54 billion, Fehrman said.\n\nAEP expects transmission investments will account for half the additional expenditures, followed by generation at 40% and the distribution system at 10%, according to Fehrman. Under the pending capital expenditure plan, AEP Texas could spend about $7 billion on transmission.\n\nChanges to federal clean energy tax credits signed into law July 4 don\u2019t appear to affect AEP\u2019s $9.9 billion plan to build wind and solar projects, according to Fehrman.\n\nA few renewable energy projects potentially could be affected by a July 7 executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to issue guidance on determining when a project may be deemed \u201cunder construction,\u201d a key issue for qualifying for tax credits, Fehrman said.\n\nIn November, AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, with an option to buy up to 1 GW in total by the end of this year, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are offering the fuel cells to data centers and other large customers as an immediate option for addressing their needs while grid infrastructure upgrades are being completed to accommodate their demand. Ohio Power, an AEP utility, has two contracts approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, totaling about 98 MW, for electricity service from fuel cells, according to the SEC report.\n\nOhio H.B. 15, which takes effect Aug. 14, repealed the statute that permits electric utilities to provide customer-sited renewable generation service such as fuel cells, but the law grandfathered the two PUCO-approved contracts, AEP said.\n\nTexas H.B. 5247, which became law in June, is \u201cincredibly constructive\u201d legislation for AEP Texas, according to Fehrman. The bill allows eligible utilities to use a \u201cunified tracker mechanism\u201d to recover their expenses, reducing regulatory lag, he said.\n\nThe cost-recovery mechanism could increase AEP Texas\u2019 return on equity by 0.5% to 1%, according to Mihalik. The utility has an 8.6% earned ROE, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is highly supportive of increasing our capital allocation to Texas as we participate in the massive infrastructure build-out needed to drive the economic growth in the state,\u201d Fehrman said.\n\nAEP\u2019s utilities have about 5.6 million customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** AEP expects massive new data center load, fueling significant capital plan increase.\n\n**Key details:** American Electric Power (AEP) anticipates interconnecting 24 GW of new load by 2030, a nearly 15% increase from its prior estimate, with 18 GW from data centers. This 24 GW is backed by signed commitments, including 13 GW in ERCOT and 9 GW in PJM. Due to these new load expectations, AEP plans to increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30% to $70 billion this fall. Transmission investments will account for half of the additional expenditures.\n\n**Why it matters:** This news signals a significant, unexpected surge in demand for AEP's utility services, largely driven by power-intensive data centers and cryptocurrency operations. The substantial increase in projected load and a 30% jump in capital spending challenge any consensus view of utilities experiencing slow or stagnant growth, instead pointing to robust, accelerating demand in key areas. This higher capital allocation, particularly in Texas, aims to support massive infrastructure build-out for economic growth.\n\n**The big picture:** AEP's weather-normalized peak demand grew 12% to 37.6 GW in Q2, primarily due to data centers and industrial customers, generating about $200 million in additional revenue. The company expects retail electricity sales to increase 5.7% this year, rising to 8.9% by 2027. AEP's extensive 765-kV transmission network attracts potential customers, with inquiries totaling 190 GW. Texas H.B. 5247, allowing a \"unified tracker mechanism\" for cost recovery, is expected to increase AEP Texas' return on equity by 0.5% to 1%.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   24 GW: New load AEP expects to interconnect by 2030.\n*   18 GW: Portion of new load anticipated from data centers.\n*   $70 billion: AEP's new five-year capital spending plan.\n*   30%: Increase in AEP's capital spending plan from previous estimate.\n*   190 GW: Total inquiries about possible new load for AEP utilities.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **American Electric Power (AEP):** Utility company expecting significant load growth and a major increase in capital spending.\n*   **William Fehrman:** AEP president and CEO, provided details on load projections, capital plans, and legislative impacts.\n*   **Trevor Mihalik:** AEP CFO, reported on peak demand growth and potential return on equity increases.\n*   **Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT):** Market identified by AEP as a key area for 13 GW of pending new load.\n*   **PJM Interconnection:** Market where AEP expects 9 GW of pending new load, including Ohio and Indiana data centers.\n*   **Bloom Energy:** Company from which AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells, with an option for up to 1 GW.\n*   **Ohio Power:** An AEP utility with two Public Utilities Commission of Ohio-approved contracts for fuel cell service.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   AEP expects to increase its five-year capital spending plan this fall.\n*   The U.S. Treasury Department is directed to issue guidance on \"under construction\" definitions for clean energy tax credits.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Surging data center demand drives AEP's capital spending to new highs.",

        "summary_text": "Morgan Scott is vice president of global partnerships and outreach at the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nExtreme weather is here. Over the past month, the U.S. has experienced dangerous and deadly flash flooding and extreme heat. Projections for the 2025 wildfire season in the Western U.S. indicate significantly increased fire potential driven by drought expansion and above-average temperatures. Meanwhile, the 2025 U.S. tornado season is on track to be above the 30-year historical average, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season.\n\nBesides the devastating loss of life and the damage inflicted by these types of events, they have something else in common: they often leave communities without power to meet critical needs. Despite the inevitable occurrence of these events, there is good news for people in the paths of these natural disasters.\n\nThe power sector is not waiting around to reactively address damage from the next severe weather event. Hurricanes or extreme heat may be seasonal, but preparation is not.\n\nA coalition of more than 40 energy providers and system operators \u2014 along with 100 academics, policymakers, non-profits, government agencies and others \u2014 have worked together to develop a data-driven, science-based framework to improve the resilience and reliability of the power system.\n\nThe public Climate READi framework, issued and developed by independent, non-profit energy R&D institute EPRI, guides energy companies in assessing risk and vulnerability in the energy system across a wide variety of weather and climate conditions. In addition, utilities, regulators and other stakeholders can use this set of guidance, references and tools to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments and adapt the evolving electric system to the climate of the future.\n\nThe framework, developed over the past three years, highlights how factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems' resilience to climate hazards. Knowing the exposure of assets and systems to current and future climate hazards and pinpointing system vulnerabilities at the asset and company level is key for determining which adaptation strategies to consider for any region. It\u2019s important to note there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer, as a West Coast utility may need to prepare against wildfires versus an East Coast utility, which may more frequently deal with ice storms. Having different options for what best suits individual utilities will be key to proactive planning for these events.\n\nSo how do companies conduct climate-informed planning and analysis?\n\nFirst, the framework recommends having a dedicated team with clear ownership and responsibility. Once in place, the framework recommends the team begin with in-depth and iterative scoping, setting expectations among internal and external stakeholders to define the bounds and objectives of the assessment, while also integrating information from previous impacts of weather and climate events on asset or system performance. This involves the selection of climate data and vulnerability information that characterizes baseline conditions and captures the range of expected future conditions.\n\nSecond, the framework recommends conducting model-based evaluations across an integrated modeling platform, where data and assumptions are used consistently throughout. The company may also want to review its existing integrated resource plans, regulatory filings, or other planning documents to identify plausible future configurations of its portfolio.\n\nThird, it is important to ensure the load data used for planning and evaluation reflects the weather dependency for the selected conditions and technologies being evaluated.\n\nLastly, the framework recommends comparing baseline model results to results with the various adaptations in place to determine the anticipated benefits and cost effectiveness of options under consideration. This comparison can be used to justify and prioritize adaptation investments.\n\nWork has and will continue to be underway to proactively plan for the weather of the future. For example, last year, researchers from EPRI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory mapped how future hurricanes could affect power outage risk. Working with PNNL, we combined synthetic hurricane tracks in a future climate with a predictive power outage model, developed using power outage data from 23 historical hurricanes that affected the continental United States and Puerto Rico between 2016 and 2023. This allowed us to assess changes in outage risk in the 2066-2100 timeframe compared to today\u2019s climate. According to the models, the average person in the metropolitan areas of Houston, New Orleans and Boston could see expected outage events increase by more than 70% per decade, while Miami residents may see a 119% increase.\n\nAs this analysis shows, there isn\u2019t one clear answer, since different locations have different needs and weather conditions. Regardless of where you live, it\u2019s clear that a common, consistent and collaborative framework for physical climate risk \u2014 and available to all parties \u2014 is needed to ensure the reliable, resilient and affordable power system of the future for all of us.",

President and CEO Bob Frenzel said the company believes it can prove its equipment did not start the fire.\n\nThe company is already paying claims on another fire, the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire in the Texas panhandle, on which it faces an estimated $290 million in liability.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nXcel Energy remains open to settling with the more than 500 parties suing the utility for the Marshall Fire. But any settlement, Frenzel said Thursday, must \u201cstart with the idea that our equipment didn't cause that second\u201d ignition.\n\nHearings are set to begin on Sept. 25 and will likely continue through November now that the July 31 deadline for court-ordered mediation has passed, Frenzel said. When the fire started, he said, the embers on the Twelve Tribes property were fanned by 100 miles per hour winds for over an hour and 20 minutes, allowing it to spread into nearby towns long before the second ignition at Xcel Energy's power line is alleged to have taken place, he said.\n\n\u201cAs we step back and think about the trial broadly and the fire broadly, we continue to maintain that our equipment didn't start the second ignition in the wildfire, and we're prepared to go to court,\u201d Frenzel said, later adding that \u201cwe feel very good about the facts and circumstances of our trial.\u201d\n\nInsurance data suggest the fire caused about $2 billion in damages, but the actual liability the company could face would not be determined until a second trail that would only take place if the first trial this fall concluded Xcel Energy was at fault, Frenzel said.\n\nMeanwhile, CFO Brian Van Abel reported that Xcel Energy has so far committed to $176 million in settlement agreements for claims related to the Smokehouse Creek fire, which he said remains on track to trigger a total of about $290 million in liability. These costs should be covered by the company's $500 million insurance policy, Van Abel said.\n\nCompany leaders also announced their intent to add some $15 billion in capital investment to its existing $45-billion capital plan in order to serve growing demand and reliability needs. The $15 billion figure includes a need for 5.2 GW of new generation and storage to be placed into service by 2030, and $3 billion to $4 billion for at least two regional transmission projects, Frenzel said. The company expects to release more details on its revamped five-year capital plan, including its plans for financing the expansion, following the close of the third quarter.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** U.S. lifts tariff pause, implements new country-specific rates Aug. 7\n\n**Key details:** The U.S. plans to lift its pause on country-specific tariffs, implementing new rates for over 60 trading partners starting August 7. These rates range from 10% to 41%, including a 25% tariff on imports from India. Imports from Canada, Mexico, and China will continue to incur separate duties. Goods in transit by August 7 are exempt if entered for consumption by October 5, but transshipped goods will incur a 40% tariff and penalties.\n\n**Why it matters:** This re-implementation of specific tariffs will directly impact import costs for companies trading with nearly 70 countries. The varied rates, ranging up to 41%, introduce significant cost uncertainties for businesses. This challenges a prior period of \"pause\" on such tariffs and the perceived stability from \"deal frameworks\" reached with some partners, potentially disrupting established supply chains and cost structures previously optimized under the baseline 10% levy. The explicit penalties for \"transshipped\" goods also signal a stricter enforcement stance, adding risk for importers.\n\n**The big picture:** President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday codifying country-specific duties he first unveiled in April. These tariffs were previously paused in favor of a baseline 10% levy. During that pause, the Trump administration reached tariff agreements and deal frameworks with partners like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. However, Trump stated some countries failed to offer sufficient terms or engage in negotiations during the monthslong pause.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Over 60 trading partners listed with new rates.\n*   New tariff rates range from 10% to 41%.\n*   25% tariff implemented on imports from India.\n*   Nearly 70 countries receive new U.S. tariff rates.\n*   40% tariff and additional penalties for \"transshipped\" goods.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **President Donald Trump:** Signed the executive order implementing new tariffs and codified earlier directives.\n*   **U.S. Customs and Border Protection:** Responsible for identifying and penalizing \"transshipped\" goods to evade duties.\n*   **India:** Designated to face a specific new 25% tariff on its imports.\n*   **Canada:** Imports will continue to incur separate duties not covered by this order.\n*   **Mexico:** Imports will continue to incur separate duties not covered by this order.\n*   **China:** Imports will continue to incur separate duties not covered by this order.\n*   **European Union:** Reached a tariff agreement and deal framework during the pause.\n*   **Japan:** Reached a tariff agreement and deal framework during the pause.\n*   **South Korea:** Reached a tariff agreement and deal framework during the pause.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Imports will begin incurring the new tariffs on August 7.\n*   Goods in transit by August 7 must be entered for consumption by October 5 to avoid duties.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** New U.S. tariffs start Aug. 7, increasing trade costs for many partners.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAlthough investigations into the cause of the Eaton Fire remain incomplete, Southern California Edison will launch a Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program this fall to compensate victims of the fire, company executives said during a Thursday afternoon earnings call.\n\nThe fund will limit legal costs associated with the fire and help the community recover faster, executives said. They expect to recoup the cost of the program through California's Wildfire Fund, which reimburses utilities for claims stemming from wildfires.\n\nA spate of catastrophic wildfires in recent years, including this year's Eaton Fire, has prompted concern about the fund's stability. But Edison International President and CEO Pedro Pizarro told analysts he believes the state legislature will find a solution within the current legislative session.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAnalysts on Thursday's call questioned the \u201clogic\u201d of launching a compensation fund while the fate of the California Wildfire Fund remains an active debate at the state legislature. But Pizarro defended the move as the right thing to do for a community devastated by loss \u2014 and ultimately for the company as well.\n\n\u201cYou have a community that's been deeply impacted. It's just heart breaking to think about everything that's happened there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so to the extent that we have a probable loss and Edison is already dealing with lots of litigation already, etc, then I think it's a good idea to support the community by moving quickly.\u201d\n\nSouthern California Edison has already been sued by multiple parties, including the County of Los Angeles, for its alleged role in the fire. Investigations by the LA County Fire Department and SCE remain incomplete, but as yet have not identified possible ignition sources beyond the company's transmission lines, Pizarro said.\n\nThe total potential cost of the fire remains unknown, but a report issued last week by real estate firm Redfin suggested that the nearby Palisades Fire, which destroyed nearly 7,000 structures, could cost more than $50 billion. The Eaton Fire destroyed more than 9,000 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nPizarro told analysts on the call that the fund should have something like $22 billion available to reimburse SCE \u2014 and that he believed this should be sufficient to reimburse the company for claims related to the fire once its own $1 billion self-insurance fund is exhausted.\n\nHe said that the state would find a solution to shore up the fund and, in the long term, address the broader risk of wildfire. But he declined to comment on Wednesday's news that Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to propose an $18 billion expansion of the fund, with participating utilities paying for half the upfront cost. The other half would be paid via an ongoing charge on customers' electric bills.\n\nIn principal, Pizarro said, he opposes additional payments into the fund by utility shareholders. But, he said he had not yet seen the governor's proposal, and would need to consider the balance of everything it contained.\n\n\u201cWe don't foresee and frankly, don't see a need for having upfront contributions like there were in AB 1054 previously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process of going through claims can take quite a long time and so we don't anticipate that there would be a very rapid depletion of the fund.\u201d\n\nBut Angie Storozynski, an analyst representing Seaport Global Holdings on the call, balked at the the suggestion of new cash contributions by utilities to shore up the fund.\n\n\u201cAll of the fixes that we're hearing from the legislature seem temporary to me,\u201d she said, asking \u201cwhat's the incentive, really, to an investor to support California utilities given the headaches ... and the fact that you're not really being remunerated for the higher risk that you are accepting? Again, that's just being blunt here.\u201d",

PPL Electric Utilities has a 60-GW data center interconnection queue, according to Sorgi.\n\nPPL\u2019s data center strategy includes an unregulated joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build power plants in Pennsylvania to directly serve data centers. \u201cThe joint venture is actively engaged with hyperscalers, landowners, natural gas pipeline companies and turbine manufacturers and has secured multiple land parcels to enable this new generation buildout,\u201d Sorgi said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHowever, discussions on potential electricity service agreements aren\u2019t far enough along for the joint venture to commit to buying turbines and it is unclear when it would be able to announce any news, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe've made no material financial commitments to date as it relates to the joint venture,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL intends to make sure that the joint venture\u2019s deals don\u2019t change the company\u2019s credit risk profile, Sorgi said.\n\nPPL supports pending legislation in Pennsylvania \u2014 H.B. 1272 and S.B. 897 \u2014 that would allow regulated utilities like PPL Electric Utilities to build and own generation to address a resource adequacy need, Sorgi said.\n\nThe bills would also encourage utilities to enter into agreements with independent power producers to help \u201cderisk\u201d their new generation investments, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe are primed to act quickly once this proposed legislation becomes law,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL Electric Utilities estimates it will need about 7.5 GW of new generation in the next five to seven years, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cGiven both federal and state support for new natural gas plants, natural gas pipeline expansion and streamlined siting and permitting, we are optimistic this generation can get built,\u201d he said.\n\nPPL estimates that it costs about $2.2 million to $2.5 million per MW to build a gas-fired combined cycle power plant, according to Sorgi.\n\nThe PJM Interconnection\u2019s last two capacity auctions will increase customer bills by about $20 a month, without bringing new generation onto the grid, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cThat was simply a transfer of wealth from utility customers to IPPs and to their shareholders,\u201d Sorgi said. \u201cWhat we're seeing in the market today is contracting long-term deals with hyperscalers for nuclear capacity. I would expect that to continue.\u201d\n\nIPPs are reluctant to build new generation because it would cannibalize the value of their existing fleets by lowering capacity prices, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cSo it's not a surprise to us that the competitive markets are not delivering on this much needed generation,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, PJM\u2019s interconnection queue has about 10 GW of new generation in Pennsylvania, with about 1.2 GW of dispatchable gas and nuclear generation, with the rest comprised of solar and batteries, according to Sorgi.\n\n\u201cWe see real issues with the solar developers being able to get their projects completed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we're clearly staring at a near-term supply and demand issue that we believe needs to be addressed ASAP.\u201d\n\nPPL expects its utilities in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will spend $20 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2025 to 2028, resulting in average annual rate base growth of 9.8%, according to Sorgi.\n\nWhile PPL expects strong customer growth in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, weather-normalized sales at the company\u2019s utilities in the states grew 0.5% in the second quarter and were essentially flat over the previous 12 months, according to the presentation.\n\nIn the second quarter, residential sales dipped 0.5% in Pennsylvania.

Under signed agreements, data center load could grow from 800 MW in 2026 to 14.4 GW by 2034. PPL is pursuing an unregulated joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build power plants specifically for these data centers in Pennsylvania. However, this joint venture has not yet made material financial commitments for turbines. PPL also supports pending Pennsylvania legislation to allow regulated utilities to build and own generation.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis significant projected demand from data centers creates a substantial need for new electricity generation, challenging current supply mechanisms. PPL's strategic shift, including a joint venture and advocating for legislative changes, signals a move away from traditional utility reliance on competitive markets for generation. The company explicitly states that competitive markets are failing to deliver needed generation, directly contradicting the consensus view that market forces are sufficient. This suggests a potential re-evaluation of regulatory frameworks and investment opportunities in the power sector. PPL also identifies a near-term supply and demand issue that needs urgent attention.\n\n**The big picture:**\nPPL estimates its service territory will require approximately 7.5 GW of new generation within the next five to seven years.

        "summary_text": "Arushi Sharma Frank advises NVIDIA Inception startup Emerald AI, which develops software to help data centers become grid assets, as well as technology firms working with utilities to integrate grid-edge solutions.\n\nThe same planning instincts, operational conversations and system design principles that helped distributed energy earn its place on the grid must now be applied to the infrastructure demands of artificial intelligence. We\u2019ve already lived through the work of proving that resources outside the substation fence can be real contributors to grid reliability \u2014 building controls, thermostats, batteries, rooftop solar, virtual power plant portfolios. What mattered wasn\u2019t the technology alone, but its ability to deliver visibility, control and verifiable response when it counted.\n\nWe are entering a similar moment with AI data centers, which arrive with load profiles that are shaping up to be large and urgent, but also increasingly dispatch-aware to the grid and power efficiency-aware to the providers of software and hardware behind the fence. The architecture is different. The topology is different. But the \u201cask\u201d is familiar: allow us to participate in grid stress management \u2014 not just consume \u2014 and the capital will flow to the solutions that enable flexible, grid-supportive outcomes. With the right planning framework, flexible assets can be integrated into the grid\u2019s living system.\n\nThat vision requires us to extend the same logic we\u2019ve spent a decade refining \u2014 how we plan for flexibility, how we model load shapes, how we co-invest in infrastructure, and how we compensate response \u2014 across all sides of the grid, not just at the edge. We\u2019ve certainly spent years proving that distributed energy can perform, so let us spend only months achieving the same for large load users. The opportunity awaits to unlock a different grid future, in which AI systems and human communities are powered by the same infrastructure, not competing versions of it. Capital flows in this future toward shared reliability outcomes, not toward expensive off-grid isolation. Our grid policies are an invitation for capital investment in the grid edge and in data center load response, and both investments yield value-based returns in the shape of virtual power plants and grid-responsive AI load.\n\nWe are already seeing where the grid is strained and which loads contribute to system risk and which can be responsive, dispatchable and resilient. We are already seeing capital flow toward both backup and interactive infrastructure. We can choose to unlock that participation, or we can choose to let the workarounds proliferate.\n\nReimagine interconnection and hosting capacity methods for flexible loads\n\nIt is no longer sufficient to run load interconnection studies on the assumption of a fixed, unchanging, 24/7 draw. That\u2019s not how today\u2019s demand behaves, nor should we motivate that behavior. And it\u2019s certainly not how AI data centers will behave when the right controls are enabled. Compute and non-compute workload performance and site-level flexibility can be aligned. We\u2019ve seen AI customers demonstrate load modulation without breaking compute operations. But utility interconnection pathways must accept these profiles in the first place. We should be clear-eyed about what this requires: updated screening tools, revised reliability models and planning processes that accept flexibility declarations with enforceable parameters. If a site operator can curtail or shift 40 MW with advance notice and software-based controls, or place a battery next to the load to do the shaping work so the load itself does not need to curtail, the grid should not plan as if that site is inflexible. And if we design connection queues and hosting maps around worst-case peaks only, we will get worst-case costs and delays.\n\nCreate co-location pathways with grid-side or long-duration storage\n\nThe instinct to self-provide is not going away. In every jurisdiction where interconnection is slow or capacity is constrained, the market is responding the only way it knows how: by building behind-the-fence solutions \u2014 batteries, diesel gensets, gas peakers. The question is whether those assets will help the grid or simply bypass it. We should design for the former. Utilities should develop technical interconnection standards, standard offer tariffs and integrated planning models that support co-location of large-scale storage with load. These storage assets can provide grid services, shave peaks and help avoid curtailment. But only if the grid is willing to treat co-located storage \u2014 and natural gas generators \u2014 as more than a private insurance policy.\n\nSet standards for fault ride-through and grid services participation from non-traditional facilities\n\nThere are thousands of buildings, campuses and compute clusters that were never designed to serve the grid \u2014 but now can. These facilities already have the capabilities: backup generators, battery banks, power control systems, software-defined operations. What they lack is a clear path to participate. We can fix that. Interconnection rules should allow for ride-through behavior from these systems. Ancillary service markets should invite aggregated load with dispatchable response. Invert the model: rather than designating who is allowed to help, define the performance that helps \u2014 and open the door to whoever can meet it. The \u201cwho\u201d can be aggregated distributed resources; it can be compute campuses \u2014 invite the participation and the right resources will come.\n\nAlign cost-sharing and offtake structures with actual system benefit and risk\n\nRight now, most interconnecting load is asked to bear the full cost of infrastructure upgrades, even when those upgrades solve broader grid problems or serve multiple customers. This is an inefficient and oddly punitive outcome that creates a disincentive for precisely the types of customers who are willing to invest in flexible, grid-serving design. Instead, utilities and commissions should adopt frameworks that allocate upgrade costs based on dispatch characteristics, controllability and demand flex contribution to system reliability. If a customer lowers system peak by 30%, that should matter. If they bring long-duration storage to self-provide at peak, or are willing to accept curtailment, that should matter. The same applies to power purchase risk. When AI customers face long-term, inflexible energy procurement contracts that ignore workload variability, we risk that they simply walk away \u2014 making power deals uneconomic at scale. Let\u2019s modernize those terms by offering indexed pricing structures that reward grid-supportive behavior. Recognize the load shapes of the future \u2014 not just the shapes of the past.\n\nConduct new system stability studies that incorporate compute and non-compute dispatch profiles\n\nToday\u2019s studies are still anchored in outdated assumptions. They model data center load as a flat wall of constant demand. That\u2019s not what these sites do. Compute ramps up and down. Cooling is weather-sensitive. Workloads can queue, pause, or reschedule. There are differences between training and inference, and even within those categories themselves. There are differences between AI and traditional cloud. The system studies need to catch up. At a minimum, planning authorities should require developers to submit load shape scenarios based on anticipated operations. These scenarios can and should be validated by real telemetry once sites are live. We already do this for generation. It\u2019s time to do it for load.\n\nSupport \u2018Energy for AI\u2019 and \u2018DER as infrastructure\u2019 through clear, tech-agnostic, service-specific policies\n\nEverything above rests on this final principle: if we want private capital to fund the grid of the future, we must be clear about what earns value. Flexibility must be treated as infrastructure. Energy for AI must be judged not by how much it uses, but by how well it performs. We need to set standards for what good participation looks like \u2014 and allow market, utility and community stakeholders to meet those standards in diverse, verifiable ways. That means policies that are tech-agnostic on whether flexibility comes from a 100-MW hyperscale campus or a thousand residential batteries. What matters is the reliability contribution. The system value. If a resource shows up when the grid is straining, it counts.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** New Grid Policies Crucial for Flexible AI Data Center Grid Integration.\n\n**Key details:** AI data centers are arriving with large and urgent load profiles, but can be increasingly dispatch-aware to the grid. The core request is for these centers to participate in grid stress management, rather than solely consuming power. This requires applying the same planning instincts and system design principles that helped distributed energy earn its grid place. With the right planning, flexible AI assets can be integrated into the grid's living system.\n\n**Why it matters:** This matters because capital is poised to flow towards solutions enabling flexible, grid-supportive outcomes for AI data centers. Current grid policies, however, operate under outdated assumptions of fixed, unchanging 24/7 loads, which are inefficient and disincentivize flexible designs. Modernizing these policies could unlock significant capital investment in grid edge and data center load response, fostering shared reliability outcomes instead of expensive off-grid isolation.\n\n**The big picture:** The current situation with AI data centers mirrors the decade-long effort to integrate distributed energy resources into the grid. Distributed energy proved its value by delivering visibility, control, and verifiable response. The grid is already strained, with capital flowing towards both backup and interactive infrastructure. This historical precedent suggests a clear path for AI systems to also become active, flexible contributors to grid stability.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Site operators can curtail or shift 40 MW with advance notice and software-based controls.\n*   A customer\u2019s ability to lower system peak by 30% should matter in cost allocation.\n*   Policies should be tech-agnostic whether flexibility comes from a 100-MW hyperscale campus.\n*   Flexibility can also come from a thousand residential batteries.\n*   The industry has spent a decade refining grid flexibility planning.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Arushi Sharma Frank:** Advises NVIDIA Inception startup Emerald AI and technology firms integrating grid-edge solutions.\n*   **NVIDIA Inception startup Emerald AI:** Develops software aiming to help data centers become valuable grid assets.\n*   **Utilities:** Are urged to develop technical interconnection standards and integrated planning models.\n*   **AI customers:** Have demonstrated load modulation and seek modernized, flexible energy procurement contracts.\n*   **Planning authorities:** Should require developers to submit load shape scenarios based on anticipated operations.\n\n**Looking Forward:** Not mentioned in the article.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** Unlocking flexible AI data centers for grid support requires urgent policy modernization.",

Dynegy \u2014 now owned by Vistra \u2014 continues to dispute the allegations, according to the \u201cblack box\u201d settlement.\n\nDynegy will pay MISO $38 million within ten days of the agreement taking effect, according to the agreement. The grid operator will distribute $1.1 million to Southwestern; $1.3 million to the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency; $2 million to Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers; and $33.5 million to Ameren Illinois, according to the agreement. IMEA, IIEC and Ameren Illinois will then distribute the money to its member municipalities, members or default supply customers, respectively.\n\nThe settlement amounts are based on how much capacity Southwestern (65.1 MW), IMEA (78.7 MW) and Ameren Illinois (2,104.8 MW) bought in the auction from MISO\u2019s Zone 4. IIEC is receiving a refund for capacity charges its members paid.\n\nThe parties asked FERC to approve the agreement by Aug. 29.\n\nFERC responded to the complaints over the capacity auction with two decisions. In December 2015, the commission ordered MISO to change its tariff provisions related to market power mitigation and how it calculates capacity import limits, which the agency said were no longer just and reasonable. In a 3-1 July 2019 decision, FERC found the Zone 4 auction results to be just and reasonable.\n\nThen-FERC Commissioner Richard Glick dissented from the second decision and criticized then-FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee for unilaterally ending the enforcement office\u2019s investigation into Dynegy\u2019s market behavior.\n\nHowever, in 2021, an appeals court agreed with Public Citizen that FERC\u2019s rationale for dismissing the complaints was \u201cunreasoned\u201d and directed FERC to reconsider its findings.\n\nA year later, FERC\u2019s enforcement office said in a report that Dynegy schemed to drive up capacity prices to $150/MW-day in MISO\u2019s zone 4, while capacity cleared at $3.29/MW-day to $3.48/MW-day in MISO\u2019s eight other zones in the 2015/16 auction.\n\n\u201cDynegy engaged in a scheme \u2026 to amass and hoard megawatts that might otherwise have been offered into the auction at a zero price, thereby increasing the likelihood that a Dynegy resource offered into the auction at a non-zero price would become the marginal resource, setting the clearing price,\u201d enforcement office staff said.\n\nAfter the report was released, FERC in June 2024 ordered a hearing on the dispute, but held it in abeyance to encourage the parties to reach a settlement.\n\n\u201cPublic Citizen prevailed over a politically-motivated decision by a previous chairman to dismiss a market manipulation investigation despite FERC's enforcement staff concluding Dynegy engaged in market manipulation of MISO's capacity auction,\u201d Tyson Slocum, director of the consumer watchdog group\u2019s energy program, said in an email.\n\nThe case shows how easy it is for companies to manipulate regional transmission organization capacity auctions and underscores the need for stronger safeguards to protect consumers from capacity market manipulation, Slocum said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFinancial picture: During the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call on Friday, CEO John Casella characterized the quarter as a time of \u201cstrong growth,\u201d particularly due to stable performance across the company\u2019s Northeast footprint and improved landfill tons compared to this time last year. Revenue growth for the quarter was mainly driven by the rollover impact from acquisitions and \u201csustained\u201d collection and disposal price growth, he said.\n\nM&A: Casella completed six acquisitions in the first half of this year, representing over $90 million in annualized revenue. Three of those deals closed in Q2, totalling over $40 million in annualized revenues, said President Ned Coletta. The acquisition pipeline for 2025 has over $500 million of annualized revenue opportunities, he said. The company\u2019s strategy is to solidify investments it\u2019s made along the Eastern Seaboard, including the Mid-Atlantic, while also seeking new business in those regions, John Casella added.\n\nMountain State Waste acquisition: Casella announced in July that it planned to acquire Mountain State Waste in West Virginia, which will add an incremental $30 million of annualized revenues after it closes. The acquisition will help broaden Casella's footprint in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky. The company\u2019s West Virginia base and location near the college town of Morgantown \u201cwill give us a lot of growth,\u201d John Casella said.\n\nMid-Atlantic optimization hurdles: Labor costs in the Mid-Atlantic region are currently \u201chundreds of basis points higher\u201d than in other regions where Casella operates, in part because \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of automation and optimization of routes, and that won\u2019t all get solved at once,\u201d Coletta said. At the same time, truck delivery delays have further slowed optimization plans.\n\nTruck and route optimization: Casella expects about 55 more trucks to be delivered to the Mid-Atlantic region later in the year, 40 of which are automated, he said. Meanwhile, the company completed 11 other route optimization projects in the Eastern and Western regions that helped offset hurdles in the Mid-Atlantic, he said.\n\nPrice: Solid waste pricing for the quarter was up 5% year over year, with 4.9% collection price growth and 5.8% disposal price growth.\n\nVolumes: Landfill volumes were up 9.5% year over year, driven in part by higher third-party MSW and C&D volumes due to the ongoing effects of the Brookhaven Landfill closure in New York. Casella also saw over 12% growth in internalized volumes.\n\nResource Solutions: Resource Solutions revenues were up 10% year over year to about $95.8 million , with recycling and other processing revenue up 9.6%. Average commodity sales prices were down 16% from the previous year. However, higher volumes at Casella\u2019s MRFs in Boston and Willimantic, Connecticut, helped offset that price impact, said CFO Brad Helgeson.",

Resource Solutions revenues grew 10% despite a 16% drop in average commodity sales prices.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe company's robust acquisition pipeline, targeting over $500 million in annualized revenue opportunities for 2025, signals aggressive future expansion plans. Strong price and volume growth across core services underscore underlying business health. However, significant labor costs and truck delivery delays in the Mid-Atlantic region are creating \"optimization hurdles.\" This challenge to efficient operations in a key growth area directly contradicts an expectation of smooth, uniform expansion across all Casella's operating regions.\n\n**The big picture:**\nDuring its Q2 earnings call, Casella articulated a strategy focused on solidifying investments along the Eastern Seaboard, including the Mid-Atlantic, while pursuing new business in these regions. This strategy includes recent significant acquisitions like Mountain State Waste, which will broaden its footprint in key states. Despite this growth, the company faces operational challenges, specifically with higher labor costs and truck delivery delays impacting optimization efforts in its Mid-Atlantic operations.

        "summary_text": "Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nJohn Shegerian, ERI\u2019s CEO and co-founder, is on the road again. His company has made a name for itself as one of the largest electronics recyclers in the country, expanding over the years to do business in about 140 countries.\n\nAdvancements in the electronics at the heart of ERI\u2019s business model are also the reason Shegerian travels about 175 days a year, he said.\n\n\u201cWith technology, with AI, nobody knows what\u2019s real or fake anymore. But having real, personal relationships with clients and strategic partners \u2013 that\u2019s what sets us apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpersonal relationships you build with people face to face are now more important than ever before.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years, ERI has expanded its footprint across the U.S. It opened a new battery recycling plant in Indiana in 2024 and is getting ready to open an electronics recycling and IT asset disposition facility in Georgia. The company also plans to announce several international partnerships this year. This comes at a time when the U.S. government aims to prioritize domestic recycling initiatives in an effort to get back critical materials from electronics.\n\nERI is also balancing domestic and international business expansion with sustainability initiatives Shegerian said further set his company apart in a competitive field. \u201cIt doesn't matter if you\u2019re Republican, Independent or Democrat, everyone agrees that we want to leave the environment better than how we found it,\u201d he said.\n\nShegerian talked with Waste Dive about ERI\u2019s latest carbon neutral and zero waste initiatives, its focus on its battery and e-scrap services, and its relationship with the current Trump administration.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDomestic recycling infrastructure for electronics and batteries has seemed to really pick up in recent years, and you yourself have said competition can be fierce. What are ERI\u2019s priorities in this space, and how is it mapping its own growth?\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of ERI\n\nOnly 22% of all electronics being used today and sold and used on this planet today are being responsibly recycled. That still leaves a massive 78% delta for myself and all of my competitors to chase. People ask why I\u2019m friends with my competitors, and it\u2019s because we can learn a lot from them, and it's not a zero-sum game. There's so much stuff to recycle that we can all do very well together. It's really an industry of collaboration, and collaboration is what's going to make the biggest impact.\n\nOne example of collaboration that we\u2019ve had going since about 2005 is the electronic take-back programs with Best Buy and Staples, which is now the second most successful take-back program in the world for batteries and electronic waste. We also manage the Salvation Army take-back program now. We\u2019re always trying to get the word out, get more education and activation, because people want to do the right thing with electronics, they just don't know where it exists.\n\nWhen we take back all the batteries at Staples, you know about 85% of these postconsumer batteries are alkaline batteries. Our technology so far is doing very well at our recycling plant in Indiana, [which focuses on alkaline battery recycling]. It's closed loop, no emissions, and we create and sell a wonderful black mass there.\n\nAt the same time, we're opening other infrastructure. In the fourth quarter we plan to open our northwest Georgia location, which will do ITAD and electronics recycling, and we plan to continue to grow in other parts of the United States as well.\n\nWe are also going to grow outside of the country. We\u2019re getting more and more business in Asia, Canada, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We're going to be opening locations in those regions in the next 12 months in the form of ERI owned and operated [facilities], with partners in those regions.\n\nERI recently published its latest sustainability report, which says the company is the first in its industry to become carbon neutral . What steps did you take to do that, and why are these specific sustainability metrics important?\n\nWe started our company around 23 years ago, which is a lifetime ago when it comes to technology. That was before any company had a chief sustainability officer and \u201ccircular economy\u201d wasn\u2019t a word yet.\n\nIt does cost ERI more and requires more intentional work to be carbon neutral and to achieve zero waste. You just don't write a check and buy your way into it. Our carbon neutrality and zero waste efforts stand out really fast compared to our competitors.\n\nAll our big clients like the retailers, OEMs, cities and municipalities \u2014 they all have to answer to somebody and create sustainability or impact reports. We're one less problem on their balance sheet. We're not creating more scope 1, 2 or 3 issues for them.\n\nThe fact is, we have strategic partners that are investors and board members of ERI, so everyone knows where our materials go. Batteries go right to Redwood Materials. Alcoa gets all of our aluminum and LS MnM gets all of our copper and precious metals. People know there's no brokers. They see the transparency to that.\n\nWe have eight big facilities across America, but we never had a head of procurement until about two years ago, which is kind of embarrassing. Having a head of procurement is Sustainability 101. The march towards carbon neutrality becomes a lot easier when you're buying right and when you're diverting right.\n\nNo one's truly zero waste. We're at about 2.3% to 2.7% that goes to a hazardous waste landfill, but the rest gets diverted. Those efforts all came from our procurement and also from our chief sustainability officer efforts to increase and improve our diversion.\n\nOur sustainability officer and his team also look into how to power our facilities with green energy such as solar, and then whatever we can't do ourselves at the end of the day to zero out and reconcile this, then we'll buy credits.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pretty clear that it wants to see more investments in domestic manufacturing and the recovery of critical materials, which it says is important to stay internationally competitive and reduce reliance on other countries. What\u2019s ERI\u2019s role in these larger federal priorities?\n\nIn the last nine months, we've met with leadership from Canada, the United States and Japan. They all are interested in the same thing. They don't want to decouple from China, but they want to de-risk their resources and supply chain. The question on their minds is, \u201cHow can we recycle more electronics domestically and keep those material resources domestically?\u201d And that's what we've been asked to advise on.\n\nERI had an office in Washington, D.C. for 10 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we would walk the halls to meet with both sides of the aisle. Each side gave us wonderful lip service. The Republican people typically say, \u201cWe love the job growth that you're doing in our communities.\u201d The Democrats would say, \u201cWe love what you're doing for the environment.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s different with the Trump administration, love them or hate them, is that this is an administration of doers. They've come to us and said, \u201cGive us specifics. How can we retain more electronics, domestically speaking, and keep our resources domestic?\u201d They ask practical questions and they\u2019ve followed up with us numerous times. That\u2019s never happened in all the years I had an office in D.C.\n\nBy the way, the Canadian and Japanese governments are doing the same thing. I know each one of those administrations is going to do a lot more to make their countries safer and more independent and de-risk their supply chains. This is a high, high priority for all administrations of those three countries. This is just not idle chatter.\n\nERI is known for electronics and battery recycling, but you also do a fair amount of plastics recycling because of the plastics in electronics. How has that area of the business evolved over the years, especially in the context of your zero waste goals?\n\nPlastics have always been important to us. We built proprietary shredders back in 2008, and they have been upgraded every year. Those shredders create cleaner commodities, and smelters want the most liberated resources and commodities to smelt, because certain plastics will ruin their smelters.\n\nWhen OEMs started realizing that circularity and sustainability were trends, they all created design for sustainability divisions. One of the ways they want to make their products greener and more sustainable is by avoiding buying virgin plastic and instead buying back recycled plastic from me. We make sure it goes to a good vendor who can meet our specs. We've been working with OEMs for the last 15 years on this, but now more and more OEMs are doing that. What they're realizing is that young people are voting with their pocketbooks and want to buy greener and greener products.\n\nWe've chased this space vigorously for 15 years, and we continue to chase it. We continue to find great vendors on different continents that can help us recycle our plastic that we create in those continents and then also fulfill the needs of our OEMs.",

ERI has also become the first in its industry to achieve carbon neutrality, balancing its global expansion with sustainability initiatives.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nERI's aggressive expansion, particularly in domestic recycling infrastructure, aligns with the U.S. government's stated priority to recover critical materials and de-risk supply chains. The company's unique carbon neutral and zero-waste status provides a competitive advantage, making it an attractive partner for major clients seeking to improve their own sustainability reports. The article suggests the current Trump administration is actively seeking specific advice on domestic retention, indicating a stronger government commitment than previously experienced, potentially challenging any consensus view of slow governmental action in this sector.\n\n**The big picture:**\nERI is one of the largest electronics recyclers globally, but only 22% of electronics are responsibly recycled worldwide, leaving a significant 78% gap for the industry to address.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPaper cups are for the first time part of the Recycled Materials Association\u2019s materials specifications list, the newest fiber spec since pizza boxes were added in 2020. Graphic Packaging International praised the cups update, calling it \u201ca major milestone in a broader movement to increase awareness and drive greater collection of paper cups in recycling systems,\u201d according to a Monday news release.\n\nReMa's ISRI specifications set standards for the quality of recycled materials and serve as a guide for scrap material buyers' and sellers' transactions. However, they do not mandate that recyclers must accept certain materials.\n\n\u201cThe association's guidelines are highly influential with waste collectors and with thousands of material recovery facilities in deciding what does and doesn't get collected in municipal recycling and collection systems,\u201d explained Graphic Packaging International CEO Mike Doss on Tuesday's earnings call. \u201cThis update has particular significance to us,\u201d considering GPI is a major user of recovered fiber and says it\u2019s the largest producer of paper cups in North America.\n\nThe company has helped customers develop various paper cup solutions as a plastic alternative, including at food service giants Chick-fil-A and McDonald\u2019s. In the CPG space, GPI helped Nissin Cup Noodles switch from its long-standing foam cup to a fiber version.\n\nGraphic Packaging International developed its Cold&Go paper cups for food service customers, such as Chick-fil-A, to use as an alternative to plastic cold cups. Permission granted by Graphic Packaging International\n\nMaterials and markets\n\nSpecs are important because \"it means that more material is introduced into the available recycling market,\" said Bret Biggers, senior economist at ReMa.\n\nReMa updates its specs on a rolling basis, and it accepts suggestions for new ones from both members and non-members. A ReMa member suggested the paper cups spec in September 2024, according to the association. It took roughly nine months for the suggestion to progress through the various approval phases, including creating a working group of stakeholders, receiving comments and achieving board approval in May.\n\n\u201cMost of the paper cups are made with a nice white paper, and it's generally a longer fiber, a higher-quality fiber,\u201d Biggers said. \u201cThat's what the industry wants: Good fiber going back into the stream.\u201d\n\nDuring the process, ReMa also received negative feedback that certain mills prefer not to work with paper cups. Largely, pushback centered on the paper cups' coatings contributing to contamination and making the amount of fiber recovered not worth the hassle. \"But the working group overall said that the pros outweigh the cons,\" Biggers said.\n\nWood-based fibers usually make up approximately 95% of a paper cup, with thin coatings \u2014 mainly plastic \u2014 to prevent leaks, according to GPI. Separating the materials has proven challenging for recyclers in the past.\n\nBut newer packaging designs are allowing the coatings to separate from the fiber more easily. Plus, technological advances \u2014 such as robots and optical sorters at MRFs and modern pulping equipment at mills \u2014 now make fiber recovery more efficient.\n\nGPI is on track to open a new recycled paperboard mill in Waco, Texas, in the fourth quarter. It has long touted the capabilities it designed into that facility, such as installing advanced pulping technologies that will allow the company to use fewer coating materials in the paperboard it produces. Plans for Waco also include using up to 15 million paper cups per day as a feedstock.\n\n\u201cWe designed Waco to take full advantage of this high quality, underutilized fiber source, which today mostly ends up in landfills,\u201d Doss said Tuesday.\n\nDriving demand\n\nThe advances help to drive demand for cup material, sources say. And ReMa's specs \u201cplay a key role in end market development,\u201d according to GPI.\n\nSome mills and MRFs still choose not to accept paper cups, and acceptance tends to be regional in nature, Biggers said. \u201cBut it's growing, so it's becoming less regionalized,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs of mid-2024, more than 40 North American mills \u2014 a 33% increase from the prior year \u2014 had signed on to accept single-use, polyethylene-coated paper cups, according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute and the NextGen Consortium. At that time, only 11% of U.S. communities accepted paper cups in their recycling streams, but that rate is steadily increasing.\n\nSources herald FPI's work to grow paper cup acceptance for recycling, which picked up during the last five years. FPI President Natha Dempsey told Packaging Dive earlier this year that the association is \u201cdeliberate about our recovery work and making sure that we are using a demand pull system that starts with the end markets that want materials and are willing to utilize those materials.\u201d\n\nReMa adding paper cups to its inbound specifications \u201cillustrates a recognition that paper cups have the ability to be properly sorted at most dual and single stream MRFs along with robust end market demand,\u201d Dempsey said via email Tuesday.\n\nFiber recycling rates have appeared somewhat flat in recent years, and industry participants frequently debate ways to boost it. Cups are one way to fill a gap between recycled fiber supply and demand, GPI says.\n\nIt is \u201cessential to expand the range of paperboard packaging materials that are recovered and recycled,\" GPI said in Monday\u2019s news release. \"Instead of letting billions of paper cups \u2014 a high-quality, underutilized fiber source \u2014 go to waste, what if we could put them back into circulation?\"",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUpcoming negotiations in Geneva meant to finalize a global agreement to end plastic pollution will have important implications for recycling supply chains, business innovations and brands\u2019 voluntary plastic reduction commitments, said speakers during a Tuesday roundtable hosted by the Solid Waste Association of North America in Washington, D.C..\n\nSpeakers from WM, the Circular Action Alliance, SC Johnson and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they are closely monitoring the upcoming round of Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings that will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSome of these outcomes of INC-5.2 may impact plastic production, design and available end markets, which is really crucial,\u201d said Amy Lestition Burke, SWANA\u2019s CEO.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear just what direction this round of negotiations may take, Burke said waste and packaging stakeholders are watching for major movement on topics such as proposed extended producer responsibility models or proposed limits on overall plastic production. Those two facets could meaningfully shape recycling supply chains and influence brands\u2019 packaging design decisions, she said.\n\nThe Geneva negotiations are a continuation of a long-term discussion between global governments and stakeholders that started in 2022 and is meant to develop an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution. The goal was to complete the process by the end of 2024, but negotiators did not reach an agreement at what was supposed to be the final meeting in Busan, South Korea, in November.\n\nThough stakeholders from waste and packaging groups previously expressed frustration and disappointment that the negotiations have dragged into 2025, speakers at the SWANA event said a plastics treaty is nonetheless worth the time and effort.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can all agree on is that the waste and resource resource management industry is key to this, and it is a solution,\u201d Lestition Burke said.\n\nChuck Chaitovitz, vice president of environmental affairs and sustainability for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the ideal plastics treaty outcome would offer a \u201cglobal framework that drives country ambition\u201d while helping to provide \u201ceffective collection and reuse systems and end markets where we would have a circular economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber sent a letter in June to the U.S. State Department urging the federal government to continue participating in plastics treaty negotiations by advocating for an end to plastic pollution, but not an end to plastic use altogether. \u201cAn effective agreement would provide global economic opportunities,\u201d the Chamber wrote.\n\nA global plastics treaty must include investments in infrastructure that can boost recycling in both developed and developing countries, but those investments must also ensure long-term end markets for recycled materials, said Ganesh Nagarajan, senior director of plastics for WM.\n\n\u201cThese investments need to happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just about having a framework or an agreement in place, but you need to really have those sustainable end markets behind it.\u201d\n\nBolstering end markets could help raise recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials such as plastic film and flexibles, he said. WM is currently working on some pilot programs to ramp up recycling for these materials, but is so far only recycling the materials customers are accidentally putting in their bins. \u201cOnly 2% is recycled today, so that's a large untapped opportunity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a robust and predictable end market\u201d before telling customers that such materials are allowed in curbside bins.\n\nMany global brands are already working on voluntary recycled content goals that are driving the market for recycled materials, said Jeff Bezzo, plastics sustainability leader at SC Johnson. But voluntary actions alone won\u2019t cut it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've made some great progress,\u201d Bezzo said, noting that 25% of the company's packaging globally is made with recycled content. \u201cWe'd like to do more. It is hard to be competitive when you're doing voluntary actions versus everybody rowing together in the same direction. That means the brand owners, the waste haulers, the reclaimers, all the way through the entire circle.\u201d\n\nSC Johnson is also a founding member of the Circular Action Alliance, the producer responsibility organization that manages extended producer responsibility programs for six U.S. states.\n\n\u201cWe see EPR as a key legislative tool to expand recycling, because most municipalities, let's face it, have stretched budgets,\u201d he said. Better funding mechanisms means more collection, better MRF infrastructure and more developed end markets, he said.\n\nBezzo sees EPR as an important tool for global treaty discussions, too. \u201cIn a global treaty, we'd love to see EPR as part of that design guideline, so manufacturers around the world have some certainty around what packaging they should be putting into the market, so it has its best chance to get recycled,\u201d he said.\n\nFor recycled content discussions, Bezzo said it\u2019s important for brands to see PCR content requirements \u201cratchet up over time.\u201d That would allow recycled plastics suppliers time to ensure they have viable end markets, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber recognizes that \u201cthere is a role to play for EPR in a global agreement,\u201d Chaitovitz said. However, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to consider these issues globally\u201d when U.S. stakeholders alone are still grappling with key aspects of EPR programs, such as PRO funding mechanisms and decisions about who gets to be in the PRO. \u201cAlso, we need to decide who gets the materials back, both those in the recycling space who want to recycle it, but then those brand owners and others that want to reuse that material to continue to make valuable products.\u201d\n\nFor WM, EPR could be an important driver as long as it has built-in demand drivers, such as minimum recycled content thresholds, Nagarajan said.\n\nPrevious INC meeting discussions included debates over whether to enforce virgin plastics production caps, and speakers at the SWANA event said they\u2019ll be watching to see what direction those discussions take in Geneva.\n\nBezzo said brands should already be reducing virgin demand. Such virgin reductions can be advanced by PCR requirements and other drivers like product lightweighting and reuse and refill programs.\n\nConsumers are already expressing an interest in products made with less plastic, Chaitovitz added, \u201cbut it's the market that needs to decide.\u201d",

Outcomes from these talks may impact plastic production, design, and available end markets. Stakeholders are closely watching for major movement on proposed extended producer responsibility (EPR) models and potential limits on overall plastic production. These facets could meaningfully shape recycling supply chains and influence brands\u2019 packaging design decisions.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe negotiations' outcomes could significantly alter recycling supply chains and mandate changes in brand packaging design. While brands are working on voluntary recycled content goals, speakers indicate voluntary actions alone are insufficient to drive widespread change. The potential for a global agreement, including legislative tools like EPR or production caps, challenges the current consensus that incremental, voluntary corporate efforts are enough to solve plastic pollution.\n\n**The big picture:**\nThe Geneva negotiations continue a long-term discussion, initiated in 2022, aimed at developing an international, legally binding agreement to end plastic pollution. The original goal was to complete the process by the end of 2024, but negotiators did not reach an agreement at the previously planned final meeting in Busan, South Korea. Despite frustrations over delays into 2025, stakeholders from the waste and resource management industry view the treaty as essential for a solution.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings (INC-5.2) will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n*   The goal was to complete the plastic pollution agreement process by the end of 2024.\n*   Only 2% of plastic film and flexibles are recycled today.\n*   25% of SC Johnson's global packaging is currently made with recycled content.\n*   SC Johnson is a founding member of the Circular Action Alliance, which manages EPR programs for six U.S. states.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA):** Hosted a roundtable discussion on the implications of upcoming global plastic pollution negotiations.\n*   **WM:** Closely monitoring negotiations, emphasizing immediate investments in infrastructure and robust, predictable end markets for recycled materials.\n*   **Circular Action Alliance:** A producer responsibility organization that manages extended producer responsibility programs for U.S. states.\n*   **SC Johnson:** Closely monitoring negotiations, advocating for EPR as a key legislative tool and \"ratcheting up\" PCR content requirements.\n*   **U.S. Chamber of Commerce:** Closely monitoring negotiations, urging the U.S. State Department to advocate for ending plastic pollution, not all plastic use.\n*   **Amy Lestition Burke:** SWANA\u2019s CEO, stated negotiation outcomes may impact plastic production, design, and available end markets.\n*   **Chuck Chaitovitz:** VP of environmental affairs and sustainability for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, advocates for a global framework driving country ambition.\n*   **Ganesh Nagarajan:** Senior director of plastics for WM, emphasizes the need for investments in infrastructure and sustainable end markets.\n*   **Jeff Bezzo:** Plastics sustainability leader at SC Johnson, stated voluntary actions alone are insufficient and highlighted EPR as an important tool.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings (INC-5.2) will take place Aug. 5-14 in Switzerland.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nGlobal plastic treaty talks could reshape recycling, production, and brand commitments worldwide.",

City staff and facility operators are looking beyond just paper mailers and public service announcements to cameras, screens and text prompts. The technology is designed to meet users at the bins and help them navigate the complexities of local recycling rules.\n\nAI has been used to identify items and trigger physical separation within MRFs for years, and more recently it\u2019s even been implemented to track contamination levels at the point of collection when haulers integrate camera systems into their trucks. But neither of these use cases go as far upstream as trying to help consumers make the right decision about where to put their refuse, recyclables or organics.\n\n\u201cThis was really an effort to help people better understand small nuances, and it also gave us new insights about common questions and gaps in knowledge,\u201d said Pamela Perez, the marketing manager for LA Sanitation & Environment, which recently introduced Professor Green, an AI tool for organics recycling education.\n\nProponents of these AI feedback systems hope they can cut down on contamination and increase capture rates, but the technology is still evolving.\n\nWhether the tools are chatbots or item-identifying cameras, operators have to tinker with the software over time and hone its ability to offer users the right responses. Experts say that accurate item identification \u2014 particularly at the curb, where trash and recycling come in an almost infinite number of forms \u2014 could be a challenge for some iterations of this consumer-facing AI. Another hurdle will be convincing consumers to use it.\n\nSend a text or take a photo\n\nContamination rates remain stubbornly high, as recycling rates are also stagnant in many parts of the U.S.\n\nIn New York City, for example, non-recyclable contaminants in the metal, plastic and glass waste stream have gone from nearly 34 pounds to almost 49 pounds per household between 2017 and 2023. The Recycling Partnership estimated in 2020 that the inbound material contamination rate was 17%.\n\nWaste and recycling professionals hoping to improve these statistics are looking to AI as enabling coaching for residents and visitors on the spot.\n\nA rendering of Oscar Sort\u2019s AI-enable sorting technology, which uses cameras to help people decide where to place their items at airports, universities and other public areas. Permission granted by Intuitive AI\n\nSome public-facing AI sorting systems identify items the same way MRF technologies do. Oscar Sort, a platform offered by Intuitive AI, uses a camera to see what a user is holding. A follow-up message on a mounted screen shows which bin to drop it in \u2014 trash, recycling, compost, or even (as one client requested) a chopstick-only receptacle for a recycling service to turn into wooden furniture. The software can also offer multi-part instructions, like directing a coffee cup to the trash bin and a cardboard sleeve to the recycling bin.\n\nIn the U.S., facilities such as the San Francisco Ferry Building and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport are in the early stages of using Oscar on site. The company says over 25 airports and 50 universities asked to become customers in the last year.\n\nEach Oscar installation costs $10,000 to $15,000, after which yearly services and data fees cost $5,500 to $6,500, said Brian Sano, head of strategy at Intuitive AI. In 2024, the company launched an ad-based offering \u2014 brands can pay to advertise on the embedded screens, generating potentially enough revenue for the facility to cover annual maintenance costs and then some.\n\nConsumer-facing sorting AI can also take in what the public offers via text, which is how the city of Los Angeles opted for its technology to operate.\n\nProfessor Green, the AI educator built for the city by software company Hello Lamp Post, works like a chatbot. Users in one of four pilot neighborhoods \u2014 Porter Ranch, Northridge, South LA and Watts \u2014 scan a QR code or go to the city website to text Professor Green. The system replies to tell users if their item can go in a city-provided green bin, or their trash or recycling bins instead. The chatbot understands and replies to English, Spanish, Korean, Tagalog, Ethiopian and Armenian \u2014 languages selected to best serve populations in the pilot area.\n\nIdeally, Professor Green clears up local confusion about composting rules. The City of Los Angeles has a lot of residents who move in to the municipality and might not be familiar with local guidelines, Perez said, or need help parsing the rules from those of nearby areas. For example, some of the other municipalities in Los Angeles County asks that residents line their bins with compostable bags, but the city of Los Angeles only accepts paper-product liners.\n\nToo few trash photos\n\nBoth Intuitive AI and LA Sanitation staff dip into the data to make sure that their programs are identifying items correctly.\n\nIntuitive AI does this for Oscar customers by comparing the instructions Oscar offered to the recordings of what the user was holding, every day, along with four waste audits a year for most customers.\n\nLA Sanitation staff also comb through Professor Green requests every day. They spend at most an hour on the inquiries, which is often more than enough time to spot any issues. For example, staff taught the AI to respond to questions about tamale waste, but soon realized it didn\u2019t know corn husks were part of the food. Perez said the team has since instructed Professor Green to associate the two.\n\nText-based sorting inquiries will likely give users more accurate instructions than camera-based technology, said Sharon Hsiao, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University.\n\nThat\u2019s because having people tell the AI what they\u2019re trying to dispose of gets around the issue of having to train the software to recognize what trash looks like. Written prompts can still run a wide range. As Perez pointed out, her office had a long list of terms for \u201cpet waste\u201d that Professor Green needed to recognize. But visual identification has even more variability.\n\n\u201cCigarette butts or COVID masks \u2014 those are very distinct,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cBut if you crumple up paper, it won\u2019t always be the same shape.\u201d\n\nThere are also few photos of trash that are freely available for AI models to learn from.\n\nHsiao and her colleagues tried to compile a database of these publicly accessible training images when building an AI waste sorter that relies on a smartphone camera. Not only were there too few images to train the software, but the computational power that would be needed for the AI to recognize any possible item goes beyond anything a smart phone can handle, Hsiao said.\n\nAn AI system focused on waste requires a small computer and is more likely to be accurate if developers can train the software to recognize a limited array of items, Hsiao said. Places that restrict the kinds of materials allowed inside, like entertainment venues or airports, could be a natural fit.\n\nLower barriers are better\n\nExperts expect technology to play an increasing role as local governments and facility operators look for ways to evolve their recycling education. But figuring out what will resonate with the public is an ongoing process.\n\nAI-enabled camera systems might be easier for users, despite being harder to teach. In surveys, Hsiao and her team found that people are likely to think of texting or responding to voice prompts as more work than waiting for a camera to register what it\u2019s seeing. And all of these options were considered significantly more time-consuming than the status quo \u2014the split-second decision of throwing items into whichever bin it seems to belong.\n\n\u201cAll the people that we surveyed wanted to be able to use their phone to scan items to tell them which bin it's supposed to be in,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cIn reality, they actually don't do it.\u201d\n\nTo convince people to take the time and use the AI identification they claim to want, Hsiao and her colleagues are working on a sorting system that also tells users about the benefits of their actions. Her team is experimenting with feedback about money or greenhouse gas emissions saved via correct sorting.\n\nFor now, the simpler text-based Professor Green option appears to be resonating. Los Angelenos have had over 4,000 conversations with the AI since its debut in March. Use has been particularly high in South LA, a low-income neighborhood where the majority of households speak Spanish at home.\n\nLA Sanitation is now looking at expanding Professor Green to other neighborhoods in the future. But to know for certain whether the AI system is meaningfully changing contamination rates or diverting more material from landfills, Perez and her team would have to see the results of a more old-fashioned tool: A waste audit.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Waste Dive: Recycling newsletter.

        "summary": "**Headline:** AI Tools Emerge to Tackle Stubborn Recycling Contamination\n\n**Key details:**\nNew artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being implemented to educate consumers directly on recycling rules at the point of disposal, going beyond traditional mailers. These include camera-based systems like Oscar Sort, which visually identify items and guide users to the correct bin, and text-based chatbots such as Professor Green. The technology aims to help users navigate complex local recycling nuances, addressing a gap upstream from existing AI uses in material recovery facilities. Proponents hope these systems will reduce contamination and boost capture rates for recyclables.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThis technological push challenges the current consensus of stubbornly high contamination rates and stagnant recycling rates in the U.S., offering a novel approach to a persistent waste management problem. Companies like Intuitive AI and Hello Lamp Post are developing commercial solutions that could create new revenue streams, such as ad-based offerings for Oscar Sort, indicating a potential shift in funding models for waste education. While the technology is still evolving, its success could significantly alter operational efficiencies for municipalities and waste handlers by reducing sorting costs.\n\n**The big picture:**\nTraditional waste education methods have been insufficient in addressing high contamination rates and stagnant recycling rates across the U.S. For example, New York City saw non-recyclable contaminants per household increase significantly between 2017 and 2023. While AI has previously been used further downstream in material recovery facilities or for tracking contamination in hauler trucks, the current focus represents a strategic shift towards consumer-facing education. This aims to influence sorting decisions before collection, addressing a key challenge in waste management.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Non-recyclable contaminants in New York City's metal, plastic, and glass waste stream: nearly 34 pounds in 2017 to almost 49 pounds in 2023 per household.\n*   The Recycling Partnership's estimated inbound material contamination rate in 2020: 17%.\n*   Oscar Sort installation cost: $10,000 to $15,000.\n*   Oscar Sort yearly services and data fees: $5,500 to $6,500.\n*   Professor Green conversations since March debut: Over 4,000.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **LA Sanitation & Environment:** City department that recently introduced Professor Green, an AI tool for organics recycling education.\n*   **Pamela Perez:** Marketing manager for LA Sanitation & Environment, provided insights on Professor Green's implementation and use.\n*   **Intuitive AI:** Company offering Oscar Sort, an AI-enabled camera sorting technology for public areas.\n*   **Oscar Sort:** AI platform by Intuitive AI using cameras and screens to help people sort items.\n*   **Brian Sano:** Head of strategy at Intuitive AI, discussed Oscar's costs and ad-based revenue offering.\n*   **San Francisco Ferry Building:** Facility in the U.S. in early stages of using Oscar on site.\n*   **Seattle-Tacoma International Airport:** Facility in the U.S. in early stages of using Oscar on site.\n*   **Hello Lamp Post:** Software company that built the Professor Green chatbot for the city of Los Angeles.\n*   **Sharon Hsiao:** Assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University, studied challenges with AI waste sorting.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   LA Sanitation is considering expanding the Professor Green program to other neighborhoods in the future.\n*   Waste audits are needed to definitively determine if these AI systems are changing contamination rates or diverting more material from landfills.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** AI offers new potential to tackle waste contamination, but its impact needs validation.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nOverall results: A down market for manufacturing weighed on Republic Services' earnings, particularly its environmental services business, but the company still reported growth in revenue and margins for the quarter. CEO Jon Vander Ark attributed organic revenue growth to pricing in excess of inflation. While core price was down year over year, the company still reported that core price on total revenue increased revenue by 5.7%.\n\nLabor disruption: Republic projects the strikes and extended picket lines several chapters of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called this month could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on adjusted earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2025. Vander Ark said the company primarily felt the impact through the increased costs from bringing in outside workers to replace those on strike in markets like the Boston area, where the strikes began on July 1. The company also plans to issue \"some credits\" to affected customers, though executives did not detail that plan. \"We're actively ready to negotiate and hopefully get through it quickly, but we're also prepared for any scenario,\" Vander Ark said.\n\nVolumes: Cleanup from hurricane debris in the Carolinas and wildfire debris in California provided a significant tailwind to landfill volumes . C&D waste was up 47.3% and special waste was up 22.4% in Q2, while MSW was down 2.1%. On collections, residential volumes were down 3.2%. Large container waste was also down 3.4%, which executives said reflects continued softness in the construction market.\n\nEnvironmental Solutions: Republic Services\u2019 environmental services business saw a 2.4% decrease in revenue year over year. Executives attributed that to continued softness in manufacturing activity, as well as tariff uncertainty and lower event-based volumes compared to last year. The segment still grew 1.6% in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024 due to a particularly strong Q1. Shamrock Environmental, which Republic acquired at the start of the year, is expected to contribute positively to earnings as well for the year.\n\nManufacturing slump: CFO Brian DelGhiaccio noted that since Republic Services acquired US Ecology in 2023, the manufacturing environment has been in a slump. That's impacted not just the company's environmental services segment but its $1.5 billion market vertical in recycling and waste that's focused on manufacturing end markets, he said. But executives expect the macro environment for manufacturing to turn around in the coming years and improve the business as a whole. \"What we've done in a negative demand environment gives us a lot of confidence and really encourages us about what the future could bring when manufacturing activity actually resumes,\" DelGhiaccio said.\n\nRecycling: Republic's average recycled commodity price per ton was $149 in Q2, down $24 per ton year over year. Nevertheless, revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales were up slightly year over year, driven by increased volumes at the company's polymer centers and the reopening of a facility on the West Coast. Republic's Indianapolis Polymer Center began commercial production in July, and is projected to reach commercial production in Q4.\n\nSustainability: Republic issued its 2024 sustainability report this week, highlighting its progress on reducing emissions. On the call, executives highlighted sustainability efforts like its fleet electrification initiative. Republic is still on track to have 150 electric collection vehicles in operation by the end of the year, and currently has 114 in operation. The company also brought f our renewable natural gas facilities online in Q2, and plans to open seven total by the end of the year.\n\nGuidance: The company opted to revise down its full-year revenue guidance by $175 million, and now projects a range of $16.675 billion to $16.75 billion. That was due to lower commodity prices and volumes. Republic's adjusted EBITDA guidance remained the same, while its adjusted free cash flow guidance increased slightly to reflect the contributions from 100% bonus depreciation enacted in the recent tax bill.",

        "summary": "**Headline:** Republic Services sees growth, cuts revenue outlook amid market headwinds.\n\n**Key details:**\nRepublic Services reported growth in revenue and margins for the quarter, attributing organic revenue growth to pricing exceeding inflation. However, the company revised its full-year revenue guidance down by $175 million, now projecting $16.675 billion to $16.75 billion due to lower commodity prices and volumes. Labor strikes by several Teamsters chapters could impact 2025 adjusted EBITDA by $25 million to $50 million, primarily from increased costs for outside workers. The environmental services business experienced a 2.4% year-over-year revenue decrease due to a manufacturing slump and tariff uncertainty. Landfill volumes saw tailwinds from hurricane and wildfire debris cleanup, offsetting declines in residential and large container waste volumes.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nRepublic's overall revenue growth was tempered by weaknesses in its environmental services and construction-related waste volumes, indicating segment-specific headwinds despite broad pricing power. The projected financial impact from ongoing labor strikes introduces a new significant cost factor for 2025, challenging prior assumptions of stable operational costs. This news could challenge a consensus view anticipating robust, uniform growth across all of Republic's segments, highlighting a more nuanced operating environment. The revised revenue guidance explicitly lowers market expectations for the full year. The continued slump in manufacturing activity, impacting a $1.5 billion market vertical, signals a persistent drag on core business areas.\n\n**The big picture:**\nRepublic Services has been operating in a slumping manufacturing environment since its 2023 acquisition of US Ecology, impacting its environmental services and manufacturing-focused recycling segments. Softness in the construction market also contributed to declining large container waste volumes. Despite these challenges, the company actively uses pricing to exceed inflation and benefits from cleanup of natural disaster debris. Executives express confidence based on performance in a negative demand environment, expecting a manufacturing turnaround in coming years. The company is also investing in sustainability initiatives like fleet electrification and new renewable natural gas facilities.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n*   Core price on total revenue increased revenue by 5.7%.\n*   Labor strikes could cause a $25 million to $50 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2025.\n*   Full-year revenue guidance revised down by $175 million to $16.675 billion-$16.75 billion.\n*   Environmental services business revenue decreased 2.4% year over year.\n*   Average recycled commodity price per ton was $149 in Q2, down $24 year over year.\n\n**Key Players:**\n*   **Republic Services:** Reported growth in revenue and margins, but revised full-year revenue guidance downward.\n*   **Jon Vander Ark:** CEO of Republic Services, attributed organic revenue growth to pricing exceeding inflation.\n*   **International Brotherhood of Teamsters:** Initiated strikes and picket lines projected to impact Republic's 2025 adjusted EBITDA.\n*   **Shamrock Environmental:** Acquired by Republic Services, expected to contribute positively to earnings for the year.\n*   **US Ecology:** Acquired by Republic Services in 2023, coinciding with the manufacturing environment's slump.\n*   **Brian DelGhiaccio:** CFO of Republic Services, noted manufacturing slump's impact on various company segments.\n\n**Looking Forward:**\n*   Republic's Indianapolis Polymer Center is projected to reach commercial production in Q4.\n*   The company plans to open seven total renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nRepublic navigates market softness and strikes, cutting revenue outlook.",
